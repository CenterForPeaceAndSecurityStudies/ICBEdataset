  How do international crises unfold? We conceptualize of international relations as a strategic chess game between adversaries and develop a systematic way to measure pieces, moves, and gambits accurately and consistently over a hundred years of history. We introduce a new ontology and dataset of international events called ICBe based on very high-quality corpus of narratives from the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) Project. We demonstrate that ICBe has higher coverage, recall, and precision than existing state of the art datasets and conduct two detailed case studies of the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) and Crimea-Donbas Crisis (2014). We further introduce two new event visualizations (event icongraphy and crisis maps), an automated benchmark for measuring event recall using natural language processing (sythnetic narratives), and an ontology reconstruction task for objectively measuring event precision. We make the data, replication material, and visualizations of every historical episode available at a companion website www.crisisevents.org.

significance: |
  Countries routinely face crises that risk escalating into full scale war but we do not have systematic measurements of the progression of past crises and what moves and counter moves led to or helped avoid war. Instead policy makers typically rely on one or two historical analogies, chosen through ad hoc selection criteria, and described in unsystematic terms. This paper introduces a new scientific approach to measuring the step by step moves of international crises over the last hundred years, combining subject expertise with state of the art natural language processing and machine learning methods. It serves as a guide for constructing and evaluating large scale measurement collection in the social sciences.
