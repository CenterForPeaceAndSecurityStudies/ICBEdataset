37,"After a negative response, he pointed to their bad vision and claimed he could see the change of guard next to American missiles targeting Soviet cities, saying, “probably this summer house is put on the map too”.115 According to contemporaries as well as Khrushchev’s own explanations, the main reason for sending missiles to Cuba was his genuine desire to protect the Cuban revolution.
Khrushchev suggests that his primary motive was the defense of Cuba against possible American invasion, but he also concedes that such an effort would redress the strategic balance of power and counter US deployments of nuclear missiles and strike aircraft around the USSR.4  Khrushchev's recollection of the chronology of events was mistaken as there is evidence mat discussion of the Cuban missile deployment had begun in late April, several weeks before the mid-May Bulgarian visit.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's primary motivation appears  to have been to defend Cuba against continuing American-sponsored  attacks by anti-Castro forces and the very real possibility of an American invasion.
Through this measure, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to defend Cuba; counter the threat raised by the Jupiter missiles America recently placed in Turkey; and bolster Moscow's leadership of the Communist world, which China's Mao Zedong had begun to challenge.
When Castro asked for conventional missiles to defend Cuba, Khrushchev saw an opportunity.

If all that Khrushchev sought was the defense of Cuba less formidable strategic force-one capable of hitting only parts of the sout eastern United States-would have been preferable; it would have helped allay American anxieties.
It now appears that Khrushchev was moved primarily by defensive concerns; he was intent on defending Cuba, offsetting American strategic superiority, and reducing, or at least equalizing, the vulnerability created by the deployment of American strategic weapons on the  11   Soviet periphery.
Khrushchev's motives for the deployment now appear to have been primarily defensive, reflecting deep anxiety about Soviet strategic nuclear inferiority and the vulnerability of Cuba to an American invasion.

Castro's choice of words in this statement reflect his understanding that in addition to protecting Cuba, the missiles would project Soviet power in the region.

The crisis started on Oct., 1962, when Kennedy was told that a U-2 spy plane had photographed Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, 90 miles from Key West.
The Cuban missile crisis began on Oct., 1962, when American intelligence services presented Kennedy with aerial photos - taken from more than 65,000 feet by the famous U-2 spy planes - showing clearly that the Soviet forces which had arrived that August were installing launch platforms for nuclear missiles.

Another important focus is the mistaken assessment of the United States intelligence community that the Soviets were not going to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba.
First, as was well understood at the time, the intelligence community had erroneously estimated on 19 September that the Soviet leaders probably would not station nuclear-armed medium- or intermediate-range missiles in Cuba.
More recently, the intelligence community had assured the President that the Soviets would not put missiles into Cuba.

53,"For its part, the American Intelligence Community  had a status quo mind-set that concluded Khrushchev would not place such missiles in Cuba because the Soviets had never before placed such offensive missiles outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Warsaw Pact.
Khrushchev could not understand why the United States assumed the right to place missiles  in Turkey and Western Europe but would not allow the Soviets to place missiles in  Cuba   This is a point echoed by other historians who identify Soviet anger at US hypocrisy as an inducement to Cuban events.
The Soviet Union also had the right to install its missiles in Cuba as a reaction to the United States’ installation of missiles in Turkey.
The Soviet Union secretly placed missiles in Cuba in 1962 to support Fidel Castro’s administration against the United States.

42,"Had United States leaders believed the Soviets would deploy missiles to Cuba, or even taken the possibility of such a tactic seriously, there would have been several options available to them to prevent such a deployment.
In retrospect, that should have been done; it would at least have forced the Soviet leaders to weigh more carefully the risks of their action, and might have led them to refrain from including strategic medium- and intermediate-range nuclear armed missiles in the military contingent they were contemplating dispatching to Cuba.
It also concluded that,  if the United States takes direct military action against Cuba,  the Soviet Union would not attack the U.S., either from  Soviet bases or with its missiles in Cuba, even if the  latter were operational and not put out of action before  57   they could be readied for firing.
Moreover, as many officials acknowledged, the Soviet missiles in Cuba did not come near eliminating United States strategic nuclear superior- ity.
The Soviet Politburo appears to have justified its decision by reasoning that United States nuclear missiles in Turkey, which bordered the Soviet Union, were no different than Soviet missiles so close to the United States in Cuba.
The United States also privately agreed to remove intermediate nuclear missiles located in Turkey, close to the Soviet Union.",0.4136951234635838

At least as far as the Chilean Foreign Ministry was concerned, U.S.-Cuban hostility was helping Cuba to mobilize support and boosting anti-U.S. sectors in the region.
Cuba also sought at the  time to maintain good relations with several countries in the hemisphere,  such as Brazil and Mexico, which had publicly opposed a United States attack  against Cuba.
Feeling threatened, Cuba stepped up its revolu- tionary efforts in Latin America, and began to turn toward the Soviet Union for support, which in turn reinforced American perceptions that Cuba represented a hemispheric threat, and led to further efforts to isolate Castro.
Fidel Castro's radical Cuban government alarmed United States officials because it advocated revolution throughout Latin America and built economic and military ties with the Soviet Union, the United States’ primary Cold War adversary.

Kennedy noted that the Soviets had assured the United States that no offensive weapons were being sent to Cuba.
On September 4, President Kennedy revealed the presence of ground- to-air antiaircraft missiles in Cuba and warned the Soviet Union not to install offensive weapons in Cuba.
President Kennedy, after all, on 4 September had not only warned against Soviet introduction of strategic offensive forces, but also against 'any organized combat force in Cuba from any Soviet bloc country' - and the Soviet contingent certainly was that.
So confident was Khrushchev that when Kennedy administration officials warned in July and August 1962 that the United States would respond strongly should the Soviets deploy nuclear or other significant weaponry in Cuba, he implicitly denied any intention of doing so.

3,"In this regard it is important to remember that Kennedy made every effort to allow Khrushchev to save what face he could - something that could not have been predicted with any degree of confidence in advance.
Kennedy, on the other hand, appreciated the difficulty that Khrushchev had got himself into by attempting to conceal the missile deployments and, having been caught in midstream, then needing a graceful exit in order to save some face.
Nevertheless, it is intuitive to expect desperate action from desperate people, and had the Kennedy administration understood that Khrushchev was attempting to shore up a position of vulnerability, they might then have evaluated the possibility of a missile deployment differently.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev thought that although this counterdeployment would initially cause much commotion, Kennedy, whom Khrushchev viewed as being young and inexperienced as the result of Kennedy's earlier failure in the 1961 Bay of Pigs incident, would eventually get used to the idea of having missiles situated near United States territory.
US Political Threat Perception The Soviet placement of missiles in Cuba, quite possibly the result of Krushchev’s miscalculation of the resolve of President Kennedy and an underestimation of him and his advisors, was of both military and strategic importance.

President Kennedy also secretly agreed to withdraw United States obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey.
Secretly, the United States also agreed that it would dismantle all its Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
The United States also secretly promised to remove obsolete missiles from Turkey.
This was to remove the missiles from Cuba in return for the United States removing its missiles from Turkey just over the Soviet border.",0.5085506713617373

11,"At 10:52 P.M., the message is read to ment of missiles in Cuba ""required the responses I Kennedy.
Otherwise, Kennedy noted in a private letter, mantling of the Cuban missile sites.
Presumably referring to the strategic missiles, Kennedy told some of his senior advisers at a December 1962 defense budget discussion that “what they had in Cuba alone would have been a substantial deterrent to me,” a remarkable confession for a Cold War president to make even in private.
Reached through sober analysis, Stern’s conclusion that “John F Kennedy and his administration, without question, bore a substantial share of the responsibility for the onset of the Cuban missile crisis” would have shocked the American people in 1962, for the simple reason that Kennedy’s administration had misled them about the military imbalance between the superpowers and had concealed its campaign of threats, assassination plots, and sabotage designed to overthrow the government in Cuba—an effort well known to Soviet and Cuban officials.
The Cuban missile crisis was triggered by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev’s decision to redress the disparity in nuclear arms between the United States and the United States President John F Kennedy had won election in 1960 by arguing that there was a “missile gap” between the two countries that favored the Soviets, but in fact the situation was the opposite.
The missile crisis was the most sensitive point in escalating tensions between the two superpowers that dated to the Soviet entry into the nuclear club but more recently had heightened after the downing of an American U-2 reconnaissance plane over Russia, the ill- fated Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba shortly after Kennedy took office and the belief by Khrushchev that he could bully and badger the new president as he did at the Vienna summit during Kennedy's first months in office.",0.5218533069316222
34,"Although a few Americans remained sceptical, most of them readily accepted the notion that the commander of Soviet troops in Cuba was authorized during the crisis to use tactical nuclear weapons against invading United States forces.
Although American leaders did not know it at the time, the Soviet Union already had tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba during the crisis, ready for use in the event of a United States invasion.
Among the revelations to come out of these reunions were that the Soviets had deployed nine tactical missiles in Cuba to be used against any United States invasion force, and that the Soviet field commanders had the authority to fire those tactical nuclear weapons without further direction from the Kremlin.
It also concluded that,  if the United States takes direct military action against Cuba,  the Soviet Union would not attack the U.S., either from  Soviet bases or with its missiles in Cuba, even if the  latter were operational and not put out of action before  57   they could be readied for firing.
Moreover, as many officials acknowledged, the Soviet missiles in Cuba did not come near eliminating United States strategic nuclear superior- ity.
The Soviet Politburo appears to have justified its decision by reasoning that United States nuclear missiles in Turkey, which bordered the Soviet Union, were no different than Soviet missiles so close to the United States in Cuba.",0.5246978611172648
4,"Nearly everyone who has examined the Cuban missile crisis argues that  the Soviets were operating on an incorrect image of their opponent and were genuinely  surprised when Kennedy reacted as firmly as he did.
The Cubans do seem to have been surprised by President Kennedy's  22 October revelation about the missiles, although apparently they were  not as complacent about the secret as the Soviets.
The retrospective CIA analyses considered at length the evidence available at that time and concluded that the Soviet leaders might have been less confident after mid-September that the US leaders would acquiesce, but not that they believed the United States leaders knew about the missiles in Cuba.5  A few American critics of the Kennedy administration's handling of the crisis have also darkly suggested that Kennedy was aware of the missiles in Cuba, but until his hand was forced by Keating and the U-2 photographs had preferred to turn a blind eye.
There is much evidence suggesting that Khrushchev believed there was a very good chance both that American officials would discover the missiles on Cuba be- fore they were ready to fire and that Kennedy would respond to the weapons in a hostile and aggressive manner.
These last two revelations are important as it could be argued that Khrushchev’s knowledge of these supposedly clandestine anti-Castro initiatives enlarged his fear of a possible American assault on Cuba, and thus inﬂuenced his decision to send missiles to Cuba.
We now know, from recently released archives, that Castro was urging Khrushchev to use the missiles if Cuba was invaded.",0.5274107885509643

The crisis ended on Oct. when Nikita S Khrushchev declared in Moscow that the missiles would be pulled out of Cuba under United Nations supervision.
The Cuban missile crisis arose in April 1962, when the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba.

President John F Kennedy informed Americans during a television broadcast on October 22, 1962, that the Soviets had placed missiles on Cuba and that in retalation, the United States would erect a blockade around the island to force Castro and Khrushchev to remove to missiles.

When a more minor part of the deal fell apart, Kennedy also added risk by questioning whether our pledge not to invade Cuba was still effective, even though that commitment was comparable in importance to the Soviets’ promise to remove their missiles.
When Kennedy said, on 16 October, ""I should have said that we don't care"" about Soviet offensive capabilities in Cuba, he strongly implied that the ab- sence of the September statements would have allowed a greater range of choices in responding to the Soviet deployment in Cuba.",0.563342476042875

However, in a conversation with American oﬃcials, Turkey strongly objected to some United States and allied countries’ commentators’ tendency to equate the Soviet missile bases in Cuba with the missile bases in Turkey.

Kennedy was afraid of the loss of prestige within the NATO and he publicly denied Soviet requests to remove missiles from Italy and Turkey.
Kennedy was reluctant to make any deal which traded the Turkish for the Cuban missiles, though he personally had ordered the removal of the missiles from Turkey several months earlier on the grounds that they were unnecessary to American security and provocative to the Soviet Union.
Kennedy, in that popular version, had on October 27 resisted the Soviet Union's public demand for a trade of the 15 United States intermediate-range Jupiter missiles in Turkey in return for Soviet removal of its missiles from Cuba.
Khrushchev ultimately yielded to KennedyÊs demands that the nuclear-  capable missiles be withdrawn from Cuba, in exchange for an open promise  that the United States would not invade the island and a private agreement  that NATO missiles in Turkey would also be removed within six months.

56,"Consider the claim that if Kennedy predetermined by a fundamental law of world politics, had heeded his hawkish advisers during the missile and close-call claims that these bids to dominate crisis, and attacked Soviet bases in Cuba, World War Europe might have succeeded are misinformed.
However, some revisioanry scholars have criticized Kennedy’s interpretation of the threat posed by the Cuban missiles as an overreaction not warranted by a sober assessment of Soviet intentions and strategic goals.
Kennedy Weighs the Options From the outset of the crisis, Kennedy and ExComm determined that the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba was unacceptable.
Motives behind Kennedy's Advocacy of Military Action The central paradox of Kennedy's thinking on 16 October was, there- fore, that he did not believe the missiles in Cuba changed the strategic balance of power between the superpowers, did not think Khrushchev would utilize the missiles to assail America, and was uncertain as to the reasons behind the Soviet deployment, and yet at the same time he was utterly convinced of the need for a military response to the Soviet chal- lenge in Cuba.
This implies that Kennedy might have launched a military attack on Cuba had he not understood the state of readiness of the missiles.
While he privately did not believe a nuclear strike against Cuba was likely because of Soviet retaliation, Kennedy did support a conventional air attack and invasion of the island nation should the Soviets fail to remove the missiles.",0.5713815384999308

Days later, the deadly game of nuclear brinkmanship between the two nations ended, Khrushchev sent Kennedy a message that Soviet missiles would be taken back.
Khrushchev, for his part, sent a long, rambling letter to Kennedy, appealing to reason and trust to prevent a catastrophe, and insisting that if United States threats to Cuba were ended, the issue of weapons would disappear.
On 26 October, in one of several letters he exchanged with Kennedy during the crisis, Khrushchev proposed to remove the “defensive” Soviet missiles if the United States pledged not to invade Cuba.

Notwithstanding the U-2 incident, Kennedy sent a letter to Khrushchev proposing that the Soviet Union immediately begin withdrawing its missiles and that the United States would end the naval blockade and pledge not to invade Cuba.

Moreover, if the USA took the nuclear missiles out of Cuba by force, as Kennedy’s military advisors recommended, then the United States would have justification for moving into Berlin and/or Turkey.
Related to United States missile superiority, some have argued that the Soviets wanted to place the missiles in Cuba to force the United States to remove its own Jupiter missiles from along the Soviet border in Turkey.
Specifically, if Khrushchev pulled his missiles out of Cuba, the United States would dismantle and remove its Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
The Soviet Union would stand down in Cuba only if the United States agreed to remove the Jupiter missiles deployed in Turkey.
