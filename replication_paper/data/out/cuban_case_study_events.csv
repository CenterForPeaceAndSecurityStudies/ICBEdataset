67,347,"The Missile Crisis The primary motivation behind Khrushchev's decision to install missiles on Cuba, in our opinion and in the opinion of most other analysts, was the Soviet's desire to rapidly rectify the strategic balance.
There is little doubt that Khrushchev was attracted to the idea of deploying missiles to Cuba at least partly because of its apparent symmetry with the deployment of American Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
The Genesis, Terms, and Conduct of the Deployment In his memoirs, Khrushchev claims that the idea to deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba first occurred to him when he was in Bulgaria, between May 14 and 20, 1962.32 But, according to Sergo Mikoyan, Khrushchev had already discussed the idea with First Deputy Premier Anastas I Mikoyan at the end of April, during a walk in the Lenin Hills.
The issue of why Khrushchev deployed the missiles in Cuba has preoccupied American scholars.
The Jupiters in Turkey became operational in April 1962, the same month Khrushchev decided to put missiles in Cuba.
Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he developed the idea of deploying nuclear missiles in Cuba during a visit to Bulgaria in May 1962, while thinking about the United States missiles in Turkey on the other side of the Black Sea.

In fact, Khrushchev made the decision to deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba about ten weeks later, between May and June of 1962.
Khrushchev apparently believed that these would deter United States plans to invade Cuba.
Khrushchev planned to visit Cuba in November 1962, after the politically sensitive United States midterm congressional elections, by which time he expected all the missiles to be installed and operational, and then publicly announce both the defense treaty and the presence of Soviet nuclear-capable weapons on Cuba.
In summer 1962, Castro accepted a Soviet offer to install assorted short-, intermediate-, and medium-range nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba, as a deterrent against future United States invasions.
Castro urged Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to refuse these demands and if necessary to defend Cuba by initiating a nuclear first strike on the United States, counsel Khrushchev rejected.
Khrushchev subsequently proposed installing nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba to gain a better bargaining position with the United States while offering protection to Cuba.
Fears that United States President John F Kennedy intended forcibly to overthrow CastroÊs government, and a desire to redress the massive advantage the United States possessed over the Soviet Union in strategic nuclear missiles, impelled Khrushchev in May 1962 to offer to station Soviet military units equipped with short-, medium-, and intermediaterange nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and other conventional weapons on Cuba.

On October 26, 1962, Castro sent a letter to Khrushchev convinced that the United States would invade Cuba and that he should respond with a nuclear strike against the United States.
Thus it could easily S Khrushchev to consider placing Soviet missiles in Cuba.
In late April 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba.
There is evidence that suggests that Khrushchev planned to announce the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba during his visit to the island in November 1962.
In it, the Cuban leader expressed his belief that the would invade his island in the coming days and called on Khrushchev to launch at the United States in response to the expected 10.
Khrushchev and others have claimed that they were trying to protect Cuba from an anticipated United States invasion, and there were certainly grounds for such fears.
Khrushchev began placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, just 90+ miles off Florida coast in October 1962.
Missiles in Cuba would offer a qualified increase in Soviet strategic power and make more problematic any American first strike.
Therefore, he sent a cable to Khrushchev asking for a Soviet nuclear strike if the United States attacked Cuba.
Khrushchev was deploying forces to prevent, what his intelligence agency was assessing to be a certainty, a United States invasion of Cuba.
April-July 1962 The deployment of missiles of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Cuba was taken at the initiative of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.
Khrushchev proposed that comparable Soviet missiles be based secretly in Cuba in order to quickly reduce the strategic imbalance and deter an expected United States invasion of the island.
Khrushchev believed that the Soviet missiles in Cuba could be justified on the basis of their similarity to United States missiles in Turkey.
To help defend his country, Castro, an ally of the Soviet Union, asked A The standoff in 1962 Premier Nikita Khrushchev for over Soviet Missiles in military aid.
Nikita Khrushchev expected the United States to invade Cuba and drive Fidel Castro from office before the end of 1962.
Following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Soviet Union increased its support of Castro’s regime In the summer of 1962, Khrushchev installed ballistic missiles in Cuba 3.
By the time of the missile about Khrushchev’s motives for installing crisis, Soviet nuclear capability was still far nuclear missiles in Cuba as well as Castro’s behind United States capability.
In 1962, the United States could Nikita Khrushchev claim a decisive edge over the Soviet Union both in sheer number of nuclear warheads Khrushchev believed that placing the and in missiles in Cuba would address the nuclear the number of missiles.
Then, in 1962, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev began to place nuclear missiles in Cuba.
In October 1962, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, placed nuclear missiles sites in Cuba and had nuclear missiles in ships off the coast of Cuba.
Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev sent missiles to Cuba in response to the installation of missiles by the United States in Turkey.
Therefore the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba; the first time they moved missiles out of the USSR, can be seen as Khrushchev’s direct response to the United States missiles in Turkey.
Other possible ulterior motives aside, Khrushchev authorized the sending of missiles to Cuba under the guise of protecting Cuba from another American invasion.
Khrushchev draws an equivalence between the nuclear missiles which the USA has in Turkey and the missiles in Cuba.
August September • Khrushchev secretly started to send nuclear weapons to Cuba.
Consequently, the American covert operations enabled Khrushchev to station his missiles on Cuba.
Khrushchev and the Soviet leaders felt threatened by the American nuclear policy and even feared a first strike.
CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS In April 1962, Nikita Khrushchev shared his idea with Fidel Castro of installing medium range missiles in Cuba.
Thinking of American nuclear missiles pointing at him from NATO member Turkey, across the Black Sea, Khrushchev decided to station similar missiles in Cuba.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to defend Cuba from the United States and to extend Soviet strategic power in the region by secretly placing mediumand intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba, which threatened much of the continental United States.
By October 1962, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev had deployed two dozen nuclear-armed ballistic missiles in Cuba.
Furthermore, the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba allowed Khrushchev to threaten the American mainland in the same manner in which American missiles in Europe threatened the Soviet Union.
Scholars offer many different interpretations of why Khrushchev went ahead with the deployment of missiles in Cuba.
Khrushchev would later write in his memoirs that the purpose of the placement of nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba was “to maintain the independence of the Cuban people” after Kennedy had endorsed the United States orchestration of an invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961.
Khrushchev and his ministers had a number of motivations for choosing to place the missiles in Cuba.
Khrushchev wanted to ensure the security of the Cuban’s by having his missiles on their island, but on the other hand he did not want to provoke the United States into invading the island.
In 1960, Khrushchev had launched plans to install medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba that would put the eastern United States within range of nuclear attack.
However, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev surreptitiously brought missiles to Cuba, which were discovered by an American U-2 spy plane.
We now know, from recently released archives, that Castro was urging Khrushchev to use the missiles if Cuba was invaded.
Not more than 24 hours later, Fidel Castro sent a letter to Khrushchev calling for a nuclear response in the event of an invasion of Cuba.
This was a key assumption that underpinned Nikita Khrushchev’s decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba.
In April 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba.
Nikita S Khrushchev According to his memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev first came up with the idea to place nuclear missiles in Cuba while vacationing in Bulgaria.
Much of Khrushchev’s rhetoric prior to American discovery of the missiles, however, supports his claim that the missiles were strategic weaponry with the sole intention of deterring United States aggression.
The desire to retain leadership of the communist bloc in the Cold War of the 1960s also influenced Khrushchev’s decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba.
It is likely that the defense of the Castro regime, as well as the enhanced position of the socialist bloc in Cold War atomic diplomacy, influenced the decision of both Castro and Khrushchev to deploy Soviet missiles to the island of Cuba.
In these sections, Khrushchev recalls Castro’s correspondence of October 26th, which he interpreted as Castro’s suggestion for a first strike attack against the United States.
Khrushchev interprets this as an appeal from Castro to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the United States.
Kennedy and his fellow American citizens, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had his nation’s military deploy nuclear tipped missiles to Cuba.
Moreover, despite Castro urging Secretary Khrushchev to start a nuclear war in the event of an American attack on Cuba, the Soviet leader ultimately chose a less aggressive path.
The missiles’ presence in Turkey, so close to the Soviet Union, had furthered Nikita Khrushchev’s paranoia about American encirclement and helped motivate his decision to place Soviet missiles in Cuba.
To retaliate, Khrushchev secretly slipped medium-range ballistic missiles into Cuba.
I mentioned to Castro the letter he wrote to Khruschev, the Soviet premier, at the height of the crisis, in which he recommended that the Soviets consider launching a nuclear strike against the United States if the Americans attack Cuba.
On October 26, Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against America.
In late 1962, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered a secret deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba that were soon detected by United States spy planes.
Nikita S Khrushchev, then the Kremlin leader, decided to secretly place nuclear-tipped SS-4 and SS-5 missiles in Cuba without a formal decision by the ruling Politburo.
In the summer of 1962, Nikita Khrushchev made a secret decision to put Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba.
Concerned about the Americans' edge in nuclear weapons and United States efforts to topple Cuba's pro-Moscow regime, Khrushchev decided in May 1962 to send more than 40,000 troops and dozens of nuclear missiles to Cuba.
Two days before the crisis peaked, Cuban leader Fidel Castro reportedly sent a message to Soviet leader Nikita S Khrushchev urging that the missiles be fired.
In the fall of 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered a secret deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba that were soon detected by United States spy planes.
In a letter to Khrushchev, he advised Moscow to launch a nuclear attack on the United States before what he believed was an imminent invasion of Cuba.
Premier Nikita Khrushchev, acutely aware of the United States nuclear missiles based close to Soviet territory in Turkey, approved sending military aid, troops, and nuclear weapons to Cuba.
As the tension mounted and it appeared the Soviets would capitulate, Castro argued that a nuclear strike should be launched if the United States attacked Cuba.
The Cuban leader also sent an astonishingly bellicose message to Khrushchev in which he estimated that the United States military was planning to invade Cuban within the next three days.
In spring 1962, the Cold War in deep freeze, Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev decided to place intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba, capable of striking cities across the southeastern United States.
And the Soviets, led by Nikita Khrushchev, began constructing missile launch sites in Cuba to reassure Castro.
When Castro asked for conventional missiles to defend Cuba, Khrushchev saw an opportunity.
The Cuban leader also sent an astonishingly bellicose message to Khrushchev in which he estimated that the United States was planning to invade Cuba within the next three days.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who feared a United States invasion of Cuba and sought a step toward nuclear parity with America, saw the missiles as a way of deterring an invasion and doubling the number of Soviet missiles that could hit the United States.
Sergei Mikoyan, son of one of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev's key aides, said Khruschev started installing missiles because he was sure the United States would invade Cuba again.
Quite simply that Castro recommended to Khrushchev, in a letter dated Oct., 1962, that he launch a nuclear strike against the United States if the United States military attempted to invade the island to neutralize the nuclear missiles the Soviets were installing.
In his memoirs, however, Khrushchev implied that at the time of the crisis, the Soviets were ready to deliver a nuclear strike from Cuba.
Nikita S Khrushchev, then the Soviet leader, decided to secretly place nuclear-tipped SS-4 and SS-5 missiles in Cuba without a formal decision by the policy-making Politburo.
The following year, 1962, Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev secretly proposed putting Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.
In his memoirs, Khrushchev insisted that his primary motivation for putting missiles in Cuba was to deter a United States invasion.
In June 1962, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Cuban leader Fidel Castro reached an agreement concerning the deployment in Cuba of Soviet mediumand intermediate-range missiles armed with nuclear warheads to deter the U.S. government from attempting another invasion of Cuba.
Similarly, Castro’s exhortations to Khrushchev on 27 October to initiate strategic nuclear attacks on the United States should Kennedy invade Cuba, might reflect a parallel logic to NATO’s strategy of Massive Retaliation, which envisaged United States nuclear bombardment of the Soviet Union in response to a Warsaw Pact conventional assault on West Germany.
Ideas vary about when Khrushchev first conceived of deploying Soviet nuclear-armed missiles to Cuba.
An astute self-analysis, the very reason the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba may have been Khrushchev's perception that Kennedy--based on his performance at the Bay of Pigs--would respond militarily only to counter direct aggression against the United States.
From the newly released documents, we now know that Castro was urging Khrushchev to use missiles if Cuba was invaded.
It was then that Khrushchev decided to supply Cuba with long-range weapons to accomplish his goals.
Khrushchev believed that the presence of nuclear missiles in Cuba would counterbalance the American superiority in long-range ballistic missiles and guaranteed the safety of Cuba.
He believed that Khrushchev wanted to place missiles in Cuba as a way to solve the Soviet Union‟s strategic goals and secure Castro‟s communist government.
At the outset of the crisis intelligence reports noted the possibility that the Soviets might have deployed nuclear missiles to Cuba for defensive reasons.
A variety of defensive considerations drove Khrushchev to deploy missiles in Cuba.
Shortly afterwards in late May Khrushchev proposed to Castro the deployment of strategic nuclear missiles to Cuba.
Of particular concern was the possibility that the Soviet Union would deploy nuclear weapons to Cuba.
Correcting the Soviets' numerical inferiority in strategic nuclear weapons may have been one of Khrushchev's reasons for deploying nuclear weapons to Cuba.
Following the botched Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 in which the United States sent exiled Cubans to try to topple Castro’s regime, Khrushchev became more committed to protecting Cuba by increasing Soviet military aid.
Following the missile crisis, one of the primary questions of interest to scholars was Khrushchev’s motivation for placing missiles in Cuba.
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's primary motivation appears to have been to defend Cuba against continuing American-sponsored attacks by anti-Castro forces and the very real possibility of an American invasion.
Shortly thereafter, in the spring of 1962, Khrushchev decided to place offensive missiles in Cuba.
In the mind of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, there were probably several reasons for attempting the secret installation of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, just over the horizon of the United States.
Meanwhile, in his message, Castro urges the Soviet leader to start the first strike against the United States with nuclear weapons.
Cuba was afraid of a new United States invasion, and that is why they turned to Khrushchev.
To threaten the United States and strengthen relations with Cuba, Khrushchev wanted to turn Cuba into a missile base.
Khrushchev in his memoirs claimed that his principal motivation had been to forestall new United States attacks on Cuba.
Yet, Soviet missiles in Cuba could also increase the risk of American attack, as well as exposing Cuba to the accusation that it was a Soviet satellite.
The missiles that were sent to Cuba, according to Khrushchev, were done so in response to a whole series of aggressive acts by the United States against the Socialist government of Castro, most important Kennedy's decision to authorize the invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.
Khrushchev was horrified, in part because he seems to have incorrectly interpreted Castro's request as a call for a preemptive nuclear attack, that is, before any invasion of Cuba had taken place.
Khrushchev drew an equivalence between the nuclear missiles which the USA had in Turkey and the missiles in Cuba.
If the United States had intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Turkey, then the Soviets would have intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.
The need to defend the Cuban revolution against new United States attacks and to maintain Soviet prestige in Latin America were the reasons given by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev for suggesting the installation of missiles with nuclear warheads in Cuba.
Khrushchev decided to deploy Soviet medium-range missiles with nuclear warheads on the island of Cuba.
Khrushchev said in his memoirs, which he dictated and taped, that Castro had recommended a preemptive nuclear strike against the United States.
In actuality Castro’s letter requested a nuclear strike if there was an invasion of Cuba.
In May 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev thought that the best way to react to the United States superiority in developing and deploying strategic missiles was to place his own intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.
Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a United States invasion of Cuba was very soon.
In the same day, Castro sent a letter to Khrushchev through which he wanted to convince him that the United States would invade Cuba and that he should respond with a nuclear strike against the United States.
Khrushchev understood Castro’s letter as a plea to launch a first strike against the United States.
Castro’s communication to the Soviet Union regarding an imminent United States invasion led Khrushchev to believe that Castro was requesting a first strike against America.
Khrushchev's Motives for Deployment The reasons for Khrushchev's decision to attempt to deploy Soviet medium and intermediate range missiles into Cuba are even now only speculative.
Second, missiles in Cuba presented to Kennedy a threat analogous, in Khrushchev's mind, to that posed by United States missiles in Turkey.
According to Khrushchev, 'Castro suggested that in order to prevent our nuclear missiles from being destroyed, we should launch a preemptive strike against the United States.
In response to the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, and the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion.
An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.
Late April 1962 While vacationing in the Crimea, across the Black sea from Turkey, Khrushchev reflects on the Turkish missiles and reportedly conceives the idea of deploying similar weapons in Cuba.
Having promised in May 1960 to defend Cuba with Soviet arms, the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev assumed that the United States would take no steps to prevent the installation of Soviet mediumand intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba.
Convinced that the United States would attempt another invasion, Castro asked Premier Nikita Khrushchev, of the Soviet Union, for nuclear missiles.
Genesis Several theories have been given to explain Khrushchev's decision to place missiles in Cuba.
Against the recommendation from his military advisors, who distrusted Castro, Khrushchev placed the missiles in Cuba for the announced purpose of counterbalancing the fifteen United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey that were aimed at Soviet cities.
When, in the late spring of 1962, Khrushchev offered to bring Cuba firmly within the Soviet Union's orbit and to deploy nuclear missiles under Soviet control, Castro, who with good reason feared for his life and for his regime, enthusiastically accepted the proposition.
In a series of letters over the next several days, Khrushchev argued that Cuba needed the missiles to protect itself against a possible repeat of United States aggression.
Through this measure, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to defend Cuba; counter the threat raised by the Jupiter missiles America recently placed in Turkey; and bolster Moscow's leadership of the Communist world, which China's Mao Zedong had begun to challenge.
Khrushchev developed the idea of deploying missiles in Cuba in May 1962.
Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev had pledged in 1960 to defend Cuba and had assumed that the United States would not try and prevent the installation of mediumand intermediate-range ballistic missiles in the communist Caribbean country.
Castro sends a letter to Khrushchev, urging him to launch a nuclear first strike against the United States, which the Soviet leader disregards.
Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev’s decision to put nuclear missiles in Cuba was precipitated by two major developments.
Hoping to correct what he saw as a strategic imbalance with the United States, Soviet Premier Nikita S Khrushchev began secretly deploying medium range ballistic missiles and intermediate range ballistic missiles to Fidel Castro's Cuba.
After the debacle at the Bay of Pigs, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, frustrated at the inability of the Soviet Union to match the nuclear arsenal of the United States and upset by the presence of nuclear missiles in Turkey, decided to increase Soviet military support to Cuba to place pressure on the United States.
In July 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in response to the Bay of Pigs and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles Turkey, secretly agreed with Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in order to prevent the United States from attempting future invasions of the island.
So Khrushchev decided to position medium-range nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba, increasing the threat to the United States and thus strengthening the Soviet ability to deter American actions—such as invading Cuba—that worried Soviet leaders.
Soviet deployment of missiles in Cuba Justification In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.
By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.
Castro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States in case of attack.
The new Soviet documents show that Khrushchev decided to place the missiles in Cuba because he was under the impression that a United States invasion was just a question of time, and he was not willing to lose his new Cuban ally, which constituted a forward base of socialism in the Western hemisphere.
But on Oct., one day before the public crisis would end, Castro cabled Khrushchev to urge a preemptive nuclear strike on United States targets.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had gambled on sending the missiles to Cuba with the specific goal of increasing his nation’s nuclear strike capability.
Paranoia about future invasions prompted Castro to ask the Soviet Union for support, leading Khrushchev to send ballistic missiles to the country and build launch pads.
To forestall such an eventuality, Khrushchev later claimed, he decided in the spring of 1962 to install nuclear missiles in Cuba.
September 5, 1962 Khrushchev learned the United States had discovered anti-aircraft missiles in Cuba.
As a result, Castro approved Khrushchev’s idea to station missile sites in Cuba.
Khrushchev produced a plan to place intermediate-range missiles in Cuba to reestablish the balance of power in the Cold War.
When Nikita Khrushchev proposed his idea to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, Castro approved.
In the spring of 1962 Khrushchev made the decision to place Soviet missiles in Cuba secretly in order to give a quick boost to Soviet missile power, and to strengthen the USSR’s bargaining position regarding the Berlin question.
In this context, in the summer of 1962 Castro accepted the Soviet offer to install missiles in Cuba as a deterrent to a United States invasion.
During the crisis Castro urged Khrushchev to defend Cuba and reject American demands to withdraw the missiles.
On October 27, believing a United States attack was imminent, Castro urged Khrushchev to initiate a nuclear first strike.
Nikita Khrushchev met Castro to install nuclear missiles in Cuba to even there power with the United States.
If the “imperialists” invaded Cuba, Castro declared, the Soviet Union should undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States.
According to Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs, in May 1962 he conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba as a means of countering an emerging lead of the United States in developing and deploying strategic missiles.
Castro eagerly accepted Khrushchev’s offer, believing nuclear missiles in Cuba would deter American aggression and secure Cuba’s safety.
So in order to keep the United States in check, and in order to protect his socialist ally in the Caribbean, Khrushchev moved nuclear missiles into Cuba.
With that logic, Khrushchev convinced Cuban President Fidel Castro to let him move missiles into his country.
Castro wrote up a letter to Khrushchev, begging him to launch a full-scale nuclear assault on the United States the second an American soldier set foot on Cuban soil.
On October 27 Alexeev informed the Kremlin that Castro believed a United States strike was imminent and had urged the Soviet Union to strike first with nuclear weapons against America, a message that Khrushchev found very alarming, as it would mean the start of a thermonuclear world war.
In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961, and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter future invasions.
An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in July 1962 and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.
Castro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the U.S in case of attack.
It is possible that Khrushchev only placed the missiles in Cuba to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the United States Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Southern Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened.
The Soviet Union, under Premier Nikita Khrushchev had secretly deployed medium range ballistic missiles and intermediate range ballistic missiles to Cuba with Cuban leader Fidel Castro 's consent.
Khrushchev and Castro planned to secretly establish a Soviet Armed Forces presence on the island before announcing a defense pact once nuclear-armed ballistic missiles were installed and targeted at the United States.
In part as a way to protect an ally, Khrushchev decided to send nuclear weapons to Cuba.
If Khrushchev’s reason for deploying missiles to the island was merely to deter an invasion, then an overly aggressive statement from the United States risked causing the very action that it sought to avoid—the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.
Khrushchev had decided to try and change the strategic balance with the US, by installing medium-range missiles in Cuba.
In April and May 1962, the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev decided to deploy Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, just ninety miles from Florida.
The exile army was captured.Convinced that the United States would attempt another invasion, Castro asked Premier Nikita Khrushchev, of the Soviet Union, for nuclear missiles.
Both Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev (KROOSH-choff] feared another United States invasion of Cuba.
Khrushchev felt that positioning Soviet missiles in Cuba was a way to even the balance.
Castro suggested to Khrushchev that rather than give in to American demands, the two forces should carry out a nuclear first strike.
Expecting an invasion of Cuba which if successful would be a blow to the communist cause, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro agreed to place nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.
With the invasion still fresh in his mind, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev feared another United States attempt to overthrow his ally Fidel Castro, so the missiles were meant as much as a deterrent as a threat.
In addition to this, Castro and Khrushchev viewed that launching the missiles was a affective method to avoid further United States aggression.
As a result, Khrushchev proposed that the Soviet Union install missiles in Cuba aimed at the U.S which Castro agreed with.
Khrushchev doubled down on Castro’s petition and proposed the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba as a way to change the global nuclear balance and prevent any United States military “adventure” against Cuba.American hubris was matched by Russian arrogance.
The Soviet Union leader, Premier Nikita Khrushchev, surfaced the idea of placing nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter any future invasion of Cuba and also to send a message that the Soviet Union was not happy with the United States missiles aimed at them from the countries of Italy and Turkey.
Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro reached a then secret agreement in July of 1962 and construction soon followed on several missile sites in Cuba.The United States intelligence saw these missile construction sites and on October 14, 1962 flew an United States Air Force U-2 aircraft over Cuba which obtained the photographic evidence that Soviet built medium range and inter-mediate range nuclear missiles were present in Cuba.
Khrushchev decided to alleviate this “imbalance” by placing missiles on the Cuban island if he succeeded in selling the idea to the Cuban leadership.
Sometime in the spring of 1962 the Khrushchev government of the Soviet Union proposed to the Cuban government that Cuba receive nuclear-tipped missiles on Cuban territory.
This eventually led to President Khrushchev decision to construct nuclear-capable launch sites in Cuba as a check on American power.
Castro, Khrushchev writes, “was hot-headed” and had pleaded for Moscow to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
McCone reasoned that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was moving some of his shorter-range nuclear missiles to the island of Cuba where they could better threaten the United States.
In 1962, Khrushchev responded to the presence of American nuclear weapons in Turkey by secretly installing Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba.
In an attempt to redress the imbalance in nuclear missiles and ensure that the United States would not mount another Cuban invasion, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union, began a program to secretly place intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.
Furthermore, in the service of Russian neo-imperialism and Communist solidarity, Khrushchev wanted to protect Cuba from invasion from the United States Even before the crisis, with the history of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the ongoing “Operation Mongoose,” the Russians and the Cubans had reason to fear United States intentions.
The Americans had already installed nuclear weapons with the ability to reach the Soviet Union in Western Europe and in Turkey, so Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev decided to counter this move by installing nuclear missiles in Cuba.
Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis.
After the failed United States attempt to overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion, and while the Kennedy administration planned Operation Mongoose, in July 1962 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reached a secret agreement with Cuban premier Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter.
Soviet missiles in Cuba would strengthen Khrushchev's bargaining power against the USA. \n5.
Thinking that Kennedy wouldn't object, Khrushchev convinced Castro to allow Soviet missiles onto Cuban soil.
SOLUTIONS As tension continued to build up, Fidel Castro sent a letter to Khrushchev suggesting an attack on the U.S because they were going to invade Cuba.
The deployment of missiles in Cuba—the first time Soviet missiles were moved outside the USSR—is commonly seen as Khrushchev's direct response to the Turkish missiles.
Same day Fidel Castro Cuban leader write a letter to the Soviet leader Khrushchev to take decisive nuclear action against the United States if Cuba was attacked.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev decided to agree to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter future invasions.
During a meeting between Khrushchev and Fidel Castro that July, a secret agreement was reached and construction of several missile sites began in the late summer.
It is possible that Khrushchev only placed the missiles in Cuba to get Kennedy to remove the missiles from Italy and Turkey and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the Americans.
That day, Castro asked Khrushchev for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States.
Premier Khrushchev also threatened that United States aggression against Cuba could lead to thermonuclear world war.
Since the foregoing evidence is not fully conclusive, we must also consider whether the Soviets would wish to secrete strategic missiles in Cuba.
Riskiest of all, in 1962 Khrushchev secretly placed nuclear missiles in communist Cuba.
Kh rushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear missiles on Cuba to even the power balance.
Khrushchev may have concluded that placing missiles in Cuba was comparable.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev later noted that he had placed those missiles in Cuba to deter a United States attack on the Communist Cuban regime headed by Soviet ally Lidel Castro.
In 1962, Khrushchev threatened the United States by installing missiles in Cuba.
In his memoirs, Khrushchev insisted that his primary motivation for deploying missiles in Cuba was to deter a United States invasion.
Recently declassified military histories of the Jupiter missile program in Turkey reveal that United States rockets deployed along the Soviet frontier became operational in April 1962.
That fact may have prompted Khrushchev to propose that same month the deployment of similar weapons in Cuba.
Khrushchev would later claim that Soviet missiles were deployed in Cuba to defend the island against the threat of United States invasion--reflecting an offense-defense distinction based on political intent rather than the capability of the weapons.
Khrushchev apparently proposed the idea of deploying offensive missiles to Cuba sometime between late April and late May of 1962.
Nikita Khrushchev Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of Soviet Union who agreed to deploy ballistic missile in Cuba.
In May 1962, Khrushchev announced to the Politburo his secret plan to put Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.
According to Khrushchev, it was an attempt to save Cuba from any future United States attacks.
Militarily weaker than NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear missiles on Cuba to even the power balance.
Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the United States should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war.
Crisis Castro and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to place secret strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba in case the United States invaded.
Like Castro, Khrushchev thought that the United States would invade Cuba soon.
Castro asked Khrushchev for the missile sites to be built on Cuba so that he could defend himself against any American threat.
Nikita Khrushchev created this crisis by secretly sending nuclear weapons to Cuba, however, from his perspective, these missiles were matching the capability of the missiles in Turkey.
Nikita Khrushchev took this a step too far when he secretly placed nuclear weapons in Cuba.
Khrushchev believed that the installation of Soviet missiles in Cuba could be used as leverage in negotiations over Berlin.
At the time of the crisis, Cuba was ruled by Fidel Castro, whose governance was supported by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
Earlier that year, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had reached a secret agreement with Cuban leader Fidel Castro after the island experienced a failed United States attempt to overthrow the government.
In July 1962, Soviet leaderNikita Khrushchev and Cubanleader Fidel Castro reached an arrangement in whichballistic missiles were placed in Cuba inorder to prevent American aggression.Meanwhile, in the United States, the government wasdenying allegations that it hadbeen paying no heed to the placement of nuclear missiles 90miles away from Florida.To confirm that the Soviet Union and Cuba were indeed a threat,an American U-2plane captured aerial photographs of various launch sites.
Khrushchev receives a cable from Castro urging a nuclear first strike against the United States in the event of an invasion of Cuba.
The confrontation came after Soviet premier Nikita S Khrushchev was caught in the act of secretly deploying nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles to Fidel Castro's Cuba.
If Khrushchev believed the United States was preparing to launch nuclear missiles and bombers against the Soviet Union, he might decide it would be best to strike first.Khrushchev would also have other cause to fear the worst.
N Kruschev While Khrushchev did admit that there were missiles on the island of Cuba, he continued to push the line that the missiles were merely for Cuba's protection from an eventual invasion by the United States.
In response, Soviet President Khrushchev conceived the plan of protecting Cuban sovereignty by installing missile with nuclear warheads in Cuba without letting the United States find out until it was too late do anything about them.
Castro accepted Khrushchev s proposal 6 and the Soviet Union began deploying nuclear arms.
Another incident is Castro s letter to Khrushchev recommending that the Soviet Union should launch a first-strike nuclear attack on the United States.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro agreed to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, provoking a response from the United States.
During the summer of 1962 the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev amplified his support to Fidel Castro’s Cuban rule.
Khrushchev decided then to build missile bases and installations in Cuba so they would have the upper hand if the United States decided to retaliate against the Soviet Union.
These maneuvers led Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to begin covertly placing nuclear missiles on Cuba to defend the government of his new ally.
As the Americans had recently deployed their own missiles in Turkey—which is as close to Russia as Cuba is to the United States—Khrushchev wrongly assumed that the Cuban missiles would not be seen as a threatening provocation in the United States.
A declassified military history of the Jupiter system reveals that the rockets became operational in April 1962—an event that may have contributed to Khrushchev's proposal, made the very same month, to deploy similar weapons in Cuba.In addition, the documents lend credence to Khrushchev's claim that a primary Soviet motivation was the defense of Cuba against a United States invasion.
But on Oct., Castro sent Khrushchev a cable all but urging a preemptive nuclear strike on United States targets.
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev sought to placate his generals by placing intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba.
To ensure a deterrent, Khrushchev considers deploying nuclear weapons to Cuba to prevent a full United States invasion.
Fidel Castro sends a letter to Khrushchev, who mistakenly interprets it as an appeal for a Soviet nuclear first-strike.

The secret placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba was an aggressive move by the Soviets.
In the early hours of the morning, on October 15, 1962, White House officials discovered that the Soviets and Cubans were constructing numerous medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles in Cuba.
An American spy plane flying over Cuba on October 14, 1962, took a photograph of the construction of a ballistic missile installation, and President John F Kennedy and his advisors went on high alert.
Because the Soviets feared the US, they tried to put nuclear missiles in Cuba so that they could threaten the United States as well.
In October 1962, the Soviets began shipping nuclear-capable missiles to Cuba.
