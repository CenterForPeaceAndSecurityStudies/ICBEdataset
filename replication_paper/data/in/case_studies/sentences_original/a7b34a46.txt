From that point on, Americans and Soviets would express their hostilities through interference with other nations.
Cuba, once a secure place to hold American goods, had become one that was not to be trusted for its adoption of communism.
The country would eventually let the Soviets keep nuclear weapons on their land, posing a threat to American security.
The lack of communication between the two world powers was a key factor in what catalyzed the near end of the world.
Though such a close call made Americans realize how dangerous nuclear weapons were, this brush with death only increased the fear and misunderstanding between the two countries.
At the end of the Cuban revolution, in 1959, Fidel Castro started his communist regime overthrowing the US-backed government and increasing Cuba’s involvement with Soviet Russia.
The shift from a laissez-faire to a communist economy tried the trust that the United States had with Cuba in terms of government.
The media did nothing to quell matters on both sides and used propaganda as a firebrand, encouraging relations to become increasingly more flagrant.
Fidel Castro started to penalize United States trade while simultaneously favoring imports made by the Soviets.
The United States responded to the unfavorable trade with the Soviets by putting a quarantine, or an isolation order, on Cuba.
In 1961, the United States tried to overthrow Fidel Castro with disguised United States planes; this incident was known as the Bay of Pigs Incident.
Chicago Sun TimesAttempts to repair relations between the two superpowers were promising at first.
On June 4th, 1962, Kennedy and Khrushchev met for the first time at the Vienna Summit to discuss major issues concerning the two countries.
However, on August 10th Kennedy received intelligence that the Soviets planned to place mid-range missiles in nearby Cuba.
Obtaining proper evidence by the end of the month, the United States was able to use the U-2, a surveillance plane, to fly over Cuba and find Soviet missile sites.
A series of meetings were immediately held by Kennedy to make sure that the Soviets are not just using Cuba to put the United States in danger.
The first was with Soviet Foreign Defense Minister Andrei Gromyko discussing the presence of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba.
The second was with EX-COMM, government advisors to President Kennedy, to discuss the content of his future speeches and whether or not The United States should blockade Cuba.
On October 21st, Kennedy declared a blockade on Cuba.With the increase in destructive militarization for both Russia and the United States, both parties, seemed constantly on edge when it came to Cuba.
To protect from any possible attacks from the US, Russia eventually wanted to dock its weapons in Cuba.
Realizing the possible threat of destruction of the new nuclear weapons, on October 22nd of the year, President Kennedy announced on TV that Cuba would be blockaded due to the potential threat to the balance of power caused by the placement of Russian weapons so close to the United States border.
Doing such a thing could potentially ruin the trust of other Latin American countries.
When asked about the near nuclear disaster on November 29th of that year, writer Walter Lippmann uttered the same concerns as Kennedy in a Paris conference.
The clash was caused by cultural differences and misunderstandings between the global superpowers.
Castro had wanted the weapons to fend off a “Yankee” invasion, but he had to settle for an American pledge not to invade the island as part of the agreement ending the missile crisis.
Cuba remained a key player in the Cold War conflict and it remained communist.The experience of the world coming to the brink of destruction caused both the United States and the USSR to reconsider the use of nuclear weapons and increase communication between each other.
These changes would be the first steps toward diplomacy during the remainder of the Cold War years.
The USA kept their part of the deal and dismantled their missiles in Turkey in November 1962, something kept secret by President Kennedy.
Subsequently, Soviet leader Khrushchev backed down in the face of United States determination to go to war if necessary to prevent Cuba from targeting the mainland with nuclear warheads by removing the planes they planted on Cuban soil.
Not too long after, the United States lifted the quarantine it had on Cuba.
A telephone hotline was set up in 1963 to give the leaders of the USA and USSR instant contact if there was a crisis again.
The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968.
In it the superpowers promised not to supply nuclear technology to other countries.
Even after Kennedy’s presidency, in 1972, President Nixon and Soviet President Brezhnev signed the SALT I treaty, an agreement to stop the manufacturing of nuclear weapons.
Additionally, Reagan continued that mission of containing the communist Central American nations.
However, the United States and USSR attempting to mend the policies and relations did not sway Cuba.Upon learning of the deal made between the Americans and the Soviets, Fidel Castro was furious.
Though cut off by the Soviets, Castro remained firmly in power even as the United States continued to boycott Cuba economically and culturally.
Cuba remained an important area for Communists throughout the Cold War.
Despite slightly improving its relations with the Soviet Union and being more tactful with foreign relations, Americans would still face tensions with Cuba in the decades that followed.
With their firm resolve to reject American goods, Cuban-American relationships did not improve during the Cold War with an embargo still placed on the island by the US.Works CitedBeedham, Brian.
