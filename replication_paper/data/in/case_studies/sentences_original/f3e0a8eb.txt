Maryland Weather: Cloud Covered Mother's DayIn the fall of 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered a secret deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba that were soon detected by United States spy planes.
Soon after they learned of longer-range missiles in Cuba that could reach most of the country.Kennedy’s team debated how to respond but agreed the missiles would not be tolerated.The ensuing standoff with Khrushchev over 13 days became “the most dangerous moments the world has ever faced, either before or since — the closest we came to nuclear destruction,” said historian and journalist Michael Dobbs, who helped preview the National Archives exhibit.Both Kennedy and Khrushchev had made mistakes leading to this point, Dobbs said.
I think one thing that this exhibit points out is that a nuclear confrontation can happen and it almost did happen.
It was never delivered.As the blockade went into effect, Soviet ships approached, along with submarines, leading to tense moments.
One of the things that struck me … was the extent to which the president of the United States didn’t really know and didn’t fully control what was happening on the ground,” said Dobbs, who has written a book on the crisis.
