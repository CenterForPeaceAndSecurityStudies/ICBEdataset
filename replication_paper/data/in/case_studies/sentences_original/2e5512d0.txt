This was the most serious crisis between the USA and USSR in the history of the Cold War.
In October 1962 United States spy planes identified nuclear missile sites being built in Cuba.
Batista who was president/dictator at the time was viewed as safeguard against communism by the USA, but when revolutionary Fidel Castro overthrew him in 1959 they became suspicious.
Castro introduced socialist reforms and started trade negotiations with the Soviet Union.
In April 1961, with backing from the CIA, an armed force of Cuban exiles, with supplies from Kennedy, invaded Cuba.
This was a huge failure as Castroâ€™s forces easily defeated the invaders, killing them or taking them as prisoners.
This affair was deeply embarrassing for the United States as their involvement in the incident had been publicly exposed, and also because it was so badly planned and executed.
To avoid another US-backed invasion of Cuba and to co-operate with Krushev , Castro agreed to the construction of Soviet missiles in Cuba.
The Americans watched this happen with great alarm and when the U2 spy plane flew over Cuba in 1962 showing that nuclear missiles were being built shit went down.
Regardless of all John F Kennedy's attempts to achieve peace and preserve our relationship, this had resulted in the complete shutdown of trade between the United States and Cuba up until January 2015.
The United States was forced to remove offensive missiles in Turkey and has further tainted our relationship with Russia.
