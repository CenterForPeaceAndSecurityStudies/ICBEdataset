Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard are hoping for another financial “killing” with their Killing Kennedy.
But the new book may have a bigger agenda, solidifying popular history behind the Warren Report on JFK’s murder and tearing down his character, writes Jim DiEugenio.
By Jim DiEugenio A long time ago, Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly was a high school history teacher.
Martin Dugard was an author who had written a few history books,g. about Christopher Columbus and Stanley and Livingstone.
Last year, the two men collaborated on a book about the murder of President Abraham Lincoln.
Killing Lincoln proved to be a “killing” in another way, a financial one.
This year is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of President John Kennedy.
Several writers and film producers are already preparing major projects for the 50th anniversary next year.
It seems that O’Reilly and Dugard decided to get the jump on the occasion by trying to repeat the success of their book about Lincoln, thus, we have Killing Kennedy.
The incredible thing about the murder of President Kennedy is that, 49 years later, we are still discovering things that the government has tried to keep secret about the case.
For instance, just a few months ago it was learned that the Air Force One tapes at the National Archives were incomplete.
They had been edited to eliminate a reference to a query about the location of Air Force General Curtis LeMay as President Kennedy’s body was being returned from Dallas.
I mention this not only to show that there are still important secrets seeping out about the murder of President Kennedy, but also because you will not find a word about any significant new evidence in this book.
In fact, in regards to the actual murder of President Kennedy, this is a book that could have been written in 1965.
I could find very little, if anything, pertaining to the actual assassination that was discovered in later decades.
It seems to be to re-sell the Warren Commission Report’s initial assessment of the assassination to a new audience in a new millennium, except in an abridged version, jazzed up with some novelistic writing and some juicy tales of extramarital sex.
It says that Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed Kennedy by himself; that Jack Ruby then marched down the Main Street ramp of the Dallas Police station and killed Oswald alone and unaided; and that neither man knew each other or was part of a larger conspiracy.
In other words, even though 4 million pages of material have been declassified since 1964, none of this matters in the least to O’Reilly and Dugard.
In Killing Kennedy, the Warren Commission got it right way back then and the hundreds of trenchant and book-length critiques of its faulty investigation aren’t worth considering.
Indeed, one of the most startling things about the O’Reilly/Dugard book is its heavy reliance on the Warren Report because, since 1964, there have been other major official inquiries that have shown that the Warren Commission was not just a flawed inquiry, but that it was deprived of crucial information.
With important pieces of the puzzle missing, the commission’s conclusions were surely questionable.
Selective History Given Official Washington’s contempt for New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, I guess it’s not surprising that O’Reilly and Dugard never mention his investigation or the discoveries he made about Lee Oswald’s activities in New Orleans in the summer 1963.
But they also ignore congressional inquiries, such as the 1975 Church Committee review by Senators Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart into the failure of the FBI and CIA to fully inform the Warren Commission of relevant facts.
Then, there was the House Select Committee on Assassinations , which was in session from 1976-79 and concluded that there likely was a second gunman in Kennedy’s murder.
In the 1990s, public interest in the case was renewed by Oliver Stone’s movie “JFK” and especially its dramatic use of the Zapruder film of the kill shot knocking Kennedy’s head backwards when Oswald was behind, not in front, of the motorcade.
Much of this information was extremely interesting, shocking or explosive especially as it related to Oswald’s curious relationship with United States intelligence and right-wing activists.
Yet, in spite of all this, O’Reilly and Dugard term the Warren Report one of the backbones of their work and treat its conclusions as comparable in certainty to the evidence that John Wilkes Booth killed President Lincoln in 1865.
For to eliminate all this new information amounts to depriving readers of new evidence that challenges the Warren Commission’s conclusions.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the depiction of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Since the time of the Garrison investigation, until the discoveries about the CIA and Oswald in the declassified files of the ARRB, there has literally been a running stream of evidence to contradict the narrow and deliberately constricted portrait of Oswald in the Warren Report.
In fact, it has been revealed that, tipped off by Warren Commissioner Allen Dulles, the FBI and CIA rehearsed their responses about Oswald’s ties to the intelligence community.
That portrait was of the sociopathic loner who, frustrated in his own personal and professional ambitions, decided to release his anger by killing President Kennedy.
The problem with trying to maintain that stance today is that there is so much evidence to vitiate it.
When Garrison discovered this, he walked down to the address and found that it was also the address that housed the private detective offices of Guy Banister, an FBI veteran who had retired and later opened up an investigative service in New Orleans.
Mostly Banister monitored the activities of what he thought were leftist organizations,e. socialists, integrationists, communists and pro-Castro sympathizers.
Both Garrison and the HSCA interviewed several witnesses who stated that they saw Oswald at Banister’s.
Some of these witnesses said that Banister actually gave Oswald an office.
Therefore, Garrison thought Oswald made a dumb mistake by putting the address where he was supposed to be working undercover on this document.
And we know from a declassified HSCA interview with Banister’s secretary that Banister was very upset when he found out Oswald had done this.
It became exceedingly popular and went through at least five printings by 1967.
But the one Oswald had in New Orleans was from the first printing, which was done in 1961.
But Oswald could not have ordered this copy then since he was in the Soviet Union at the time.
And, two, what makes that fact even more interesting is a discovery made through the declassified files of the ARRB that the CIA had decided to run a counter-intelligence program against the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in 1961.
This included electronic surveillance, interception of mail, and, most importantly in regards to Oswald, the planting of double agents inside that organization.
This CIA program was supervised by James McCord and David Phillips, who was reportedly seen in New Orleans at Banister’s office and at the Southland Center in Dallas with Oswald.
Therefore, from these links, it is possible Oswald got the outdated Corliss Lamont pamphlet through Phillips via Banister.
Most people today would consider the above to be relevant information about Oswald, though not a whiff of it was in the Warren Commission and today, 48 years later, none of it is in the O’Reilly/Dugard book.
The Mexico Trip The authors also briefly touch on Oswald’s purported trip to Mexico City.
O’Reilly and Dugard simply state that Oswald went to Mexico to get a visa to Cuba, which is not entirely accurate.
It ignores the fact that Oswald, or someone claiming to be him, also visited the Soviet consulate in addition to the Cuban consulate.
The actual objective was to gain an in-transit visa to Cuba with the ultimate destination, Russia.
But this is just the beginning of what O’Reilly and Dugard do with Mexico City.
The authors describe an argument between Oswald and Cuban consulate officer Eusebio Azcue.
Azcue went to the movies two weeks after the assassination and saw a newsreel of Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby.
Azcue was stunned because the man he saw being shot in the newsreel was not the man he argued with in Mexico City.
Further, Sylvia Duran, the Cuban receptionist in Mexico City who talked the most to the man called Oswald, later said the same thing.
She said the man she talked to was short, about 5’ 4’” tall, and had blonde hair.
Oswald had gone to the university cafeteria and was sitting next to him and his friends.
He later struck up a conversation with Contreras about his inability to get a visa to Cuba.
Later, Contreras stated that the man he talked to was not the Oswald shot in Dallas.
In passing, in relation to another subject, O’Reilly and Dugard point up another problem with Oswald in Mexico City.
Yet, in the tapes relayed to Washington by the CIA station in Mexico City, the man they say is Oswald spoke Spanish well.
Making this even stranger is that whoever this man on the tapes was, he spoke very poor, broken Russian.
Again, every witness who knew Oswald testified that he spoke fluent Russian.
Certifying this problem, when the CIA sent tapes and photos to Washington and they were shown and played for the FBI agents interviewing Oswald, the agents said this photo was not Oswald and the voice on the tapes was not the man they interviewed.
Any fair-minded reader, when confronted with this information, would conclude something was amiss with the CIA’s story about Oswald in Mexico City.
The Case Against Oswald Which brings us to the authors’ case against Oswald.
One of the most serious problems the Warren Commission had in making a case against the accused assassin was that the evidence in Dealey Plaza required that the actual shooting of Kennedy take place in six seconds.
Two of the three were direct hits on a target moving away from the marksman at a slight angle.
When the Commission tried to duplicate this feat with first-class marksmen from the armed services, none of them could achieve the goal.
Secondly, by no stretch of the imagination was Oswald a first-class rifleman.
In fact, when author Henry Hurt interviewed dozens of Oswald’s Marine Corps colleagues, they were dumbfounded that the Warren Commission could state that Oswald could perform with such shooting skill because the Oswald they recalled was either a mediocre shot or worse.
They do something that not even Vincent Bugliosi did in Reclaiming History.
For example, the Report says that “his practice scores were not very good,” and he scored two points above the minimum to qualify in the mid-range level for shooting ability.
They leave out what many people think is the single most important piece of evidence in the Kennedy murder.
The book spends several pages describing the shooting sequence in Dealey Plaza.
Kennedy’s entire body rocketing backward with such force and speed that it bounces off the back seat.
This unforgettable sight takes place when Kennedy’s head is struck and a burst of blood and tissue explodes upward into the air.
To any objective viewer it appears that it was this shot that caused Kennedy’s violent reaction.
I think I understand why the authors left out this gruesome fact, while including another memorable image from the Zapruder film.
In a panic attack, Jackie Kennedy crawled onto the trunk of the car to retrieve a piece of her husband’s skull that has just been blown out.
If the book had described both actions, Kennedy’s body rocketing backwards and Jackie retrieving the piece of skull from the trunk, then the overwhelming impression would have been that Oswald was not the assassin, since the laws of physics suggest that a shot from behind would drive Kennedy’s head and skull fragments forward.
In describing the other shot that hit Kennedy, the one that has become known as the Magic Bullet, again the authors do something startling.
They say that this bullet entered Kennedy at the level of his lower neck.
During the investigation by the HSCA, a medical panel reviewed the autopsy photographs of President Kennedy.
Anyone can see that this shot did not enter the neck, but President Kennedy’s back.
In order to preserve the story of the Magic Bullet, the authors then censor more important information.
Malcolm Perry’s attempt to revive President Kennedy at Parkland Hospital by cutting a tracheotomy over his throat wound.
What the authors omit is the fact that later on that day, during a press conference at the hospital, Perry said that this wound in the front of the neck was one of entrance and therefore could not have been fired from the rear.
But further, O’Reilly and Dugard also say that no bones were struck in Kennedy by this bullet.
John Nichols have demonstrated if one follows the measurements for this wound given in the Warren Commission, the cervical vertebrae would have had to have been struck.
Method to the Distortions Before leaving the mechanics of the actual assassination, let me note one more intriguing description given by the authors.
The latter was allegedly to conceal him from any intruder; the former was to supposedly rest and/or mount the weapon while awaiting the motorcade.
And secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald on the second floor at about that same time.
For if Arnold is correct, he could not have been on the landing below the sixth floor waiting for Williams to leave.
To top it all off, O’Reilly and Dugard now add in something that is utterly startling.
Yet, photos taken that day reveal that the window at which the alleged sniper was firing from was raised only about 15 inches.
If Oswald were firing from a standing position, it’s likely the shot would have shattered the glass in the window, which it did not.
But, as we have seen, with O’Reilly and Dugard there is a method behind their distortions, deceptions and omissions.
Here it seems to be that they want to rely on the testimony of Howard Brennan to give a description of the shooter to the police.
But there is a further problem with the alleged issuing of Brennan’s description.
As Tanenbaum, former Deputy Counsel for the HSCA, has noted, Brennan allegedly gave his description to the Secret Service a few moments after the shooting.
Yet, all the Secret Service agents were at Parkland Hospital with the president.
Needless to say, O’Reilly and Dugard write that it was Oswald alone who shot Tippit and it was the patriotic bar owner Ruby, alone and unaided, who shot Oswald.
Concerning the former, the authors ignore the new evidence in Barry Ernest’s book The Girl on the Stairs, in which he interviewed a Mrs.
She certified by both a TV announcement and her own wall clock that the shooting took place at 1:06.
But the fact that the woman certified the time would eliminate Oswald as the killer, because the Warren Report stated that he left his rooming house at about 1:03, approximately a half hour after the assassination.
It would be physically impossible, even for O’Reilly and Dugard, to get Oswald to traverse nine blocks in three minutes.
From the scene of the Tippit murder to the Texas Theater, where Oswald was apprehended, is eight blocks.
Killing Oswald Killing Kennedy depicts Jack Ruby killing Oswald because of his outrage at what the alleged killer of Kennedy had done.
But to eliminate any suspicion that Ruby had help in entering the Dallas Police basement on Sunday, Nov., or had planned on killing Oswald 48 hours previous, the book curtails the picture of Ruby’s weekend.
O’Reilly and Dugard note that Ruby was at the midnight press conference held by DA Henry Wade on Friday night after the assassination.
Looking to the entire world like a reporter in the back of the room, Ruby corrected Wade when he mistakenly named the group Oswald had solicited for in New Orleans.
This was an important distinction because the group Wade named, the Free Cuba Committee, was an anti-Castro organization.
Killing Kennedy does not tell the reader that Ruby was also at the police station on Saturday.
He was trying to get details of when the police were going to move Oswald to another jail.
Then, on Sunday morning, there is more than one report that Ruby was at the Dallas Police station early in the morning, perhaps as early as 8:00m.
The Warren Report said Ruby came down the Main Street ramp and somehow evaded the guard there, Roy Vaughn, even though Vaughn knew Ruby.
But the HSCA discovered a new witness, one who appears to have been avoided by the Warren Commission.
Don Flusche told the new inquiry that there was no doubt in his mind that Ruby, whom he had known for years, did not walk down Main Street anywhere near the ramp because he was standing against his car at the time, which was parked across the street.
The HSCA concluded that Ruby came down an alleyway at the side of the police station.
In the middle of this alley is a door that opens to the ground floor of the building.
It turned out that the Dallas Police Department’s chief of security that day, Patrick Dean, had lied about this issue.
The book is literally strewn with errors of omission or commission on almost every page, much of the disinformation focused on solidifying long-term right-wing mythology against Kennedy as historical fact, from laying the full blame for the Bay of Pigs fiasco at his doorstep to discounting his plans for withdrawing United States military forces from Vietnam.
On the latter point, at the time of his death, Kennedy had committed not one more American troop to Vietnam than when he was inaugurated.
And he was in the act of withdrawing the advisers he and President Eisenhower had committed.
It was Johnson who reversed this plan within three months with the writing of NSAM 288.
This contained the plans for a massive air, land and sea war against Vietnam that included the use of tactical atomic weapons in case of Chinese intervention.
This is something Kennedy would never have even entertained, let alone signed off on.
Regarding both JFK and another historical figure featured in the book Martin Luther King Jr. the authors throw in many stories about extramarital affairs.
In using the likes of David Heymann and Seymour Hersh’s discredited book, The Dark Side of Camelot, they present the most extreme tales in this regard.
Concerning King, many people who heard these alleged surveillance tapes, like journalist Ben Bradlee, felt they were created by FBI Director J Edgar Hoover.
O’Reilly and Dugard spend many pages describing the alleged character flaws of Kennedy and King.
But they spend next to none describing the much larger flaws of J Edgar Hoover, longtime CIA Director Allen Dulles and President Johnson.
For decades, it has been a strategic goal of the American Right to tear down the hero status of Kennedy and King, whereas there is no similar political need to disparage Hoover, Dulles and Johnson.
So, a book that is designed to do several things at once cement the conventional wisdom about the Kennedy assassination in line with the original Warren Commission findings, pander to right-wing readers and make gobs of money would naturally ignore all the messy evidence of CIA and FBI wrongdoing and highlight the human frailties of Kennedy and King.
Thus, Killing Kennedy is just the latest example of O’Reilly’s lucrative decision to sell out, even on a topic that once appeared to draw his honest interest.
Fonzi supplied O’Reilly with many interesting stories about the Kennedy case in the early 1990s when Oliver Stone’s film was creating a new furor about the case.
The stories all pointed toward a conspiracy, and some still exist on YouTube today.
But then, O’Reilly was hired by longtime Republican operative Roger Ailes to work for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox network.
According to author Russ Baker, O’Reilly wanted to continue his investigative pieces on the JFK case at Fox, but these ambitions were quashed by Ailes, who had cut his teeth in politics as a media consultant for Kennedy’s archrival, Richard Nixon.
So today, O’Reilly’s work on the Kennedy case is contrary to what he did before.
If it came on the first page, we would have known that a supposed homicide investigation was being supervised by a political operative with an agenda to bend the history.

Rehmat is a liar. elmerfudzie October 21, 2012 at 13:43 Frankly, I could care less what Bill Oâ€™Reilly says, does, thinks or writes.
Poor Jim DiEugenio, a true example of an embittered, gullible and close-minded man, lives in a dream world.
Absolutely ignorant of critical thinking he has wasted years of his life on a wild-goose chase.
And now, he would like everybody to follow him in his universe of fiction, a totally useless and nonsensical journey.
Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy in Dallas, on November 22, 1963.
John McAdams, Gerald Posner, David Von Pein, Vincent Bugliosi, Larry Sturdivan, Mey Ayton, myself, Dale Myers, and so many others.
But of course, people are free to say whatever they feel like, and DiEugenio uses that freedom to spread disinformation and his nonsensical dreams.
It spurred me to track down Martin Dugard’s Facebook page and send him a message.
Dear Martin, I loved your book Into Africa and passed it around to soooo many friends.
How on earth can you write a book about the JFK assassination and omit the crucial Zapruder film showing Kennedyâ€™s entire body rocketing BACKWARD with such force and speed that it bounces off the back seat.
I’m sorry to say but I now suspect your critical thinking skills are on a level akin to the Rodney King jury.
This claim is not even supported by the Warren Report or at least the references you site in your book don’t come near elevating Oswald to a crack shot — and interviews iwth his Marine buddies reveal them laughing at the very thought.
Now I wonder if there are meta-narratives to this inexplicable charade on behalf of the Establishment to carry this tune for so long.
I wonder, even if the thought is strange, that the larger story is purposefully mysterious in the same way that certain masonic secrets are kept with intention.
When studying the Kennedy issue, I cannot help but also ponder the larger hoaxes that vex the publc, such as the Apollo PR fiasco, and the current war on terror that conveniently displaced the former war on communism.
While it is becoming more mainstream to assert the truth with JFK, it is more rare to see free and liberal thinkers to ponder the logical inferences that accompany the wider swath of false hstory as presented to us, the Proletarian fool public.
We see crimes in disparate places, and we attribute malice to abstract institutions like the CIA, all while continuing in a blind mission to uphold the facade of our thinky veiled tyranny, with a kind of socially agreed upon amnesia to the historical antecedants thst clearly reveal our status as victims of a great ontological crime.
We think we are born as citizens with rights, but we are truly born as consumers with privileges granted by an unseen oligarchy.
Joseph E Green October 16, 2012 at 22:05 This is a terrific and incisive article and gives just as much attention as required to dismiss this ludicrous book.
There are many fine books on the Kennedy assassination and alas we are going to get several more bad ones in the coming year.
The 50th, I believe, will represent the last chance to galvanize the country in one direction or the other, and both sides know it.
James DiEugenio October 15, 2012 at 20:30 I said nothing of the kind in my article.
What I am saying is the Warren Commission is untenable and if Oswald had stood trial, he likely would have been acquitted.
Larry October 15, 2012 at 13:34 Despite having been altered, the Altgens #6 photo clearly shows an “Oswald” in the doorway of the TSBD at the precise time JFK is being struck by a bullet Case closed.
We now know why Lovelady lied about being “doorman” and why, under duress, he changed his story about the shirt he wore on 11/22/63.
His record while in the Air Force stinks to high heaven, and recently released, non redacted documents confirm his felonious gun running activities at Andrews Air Force Base, and his subsequent flight from Maryland which culminated in his being arrested and incarcerated right at his job at the TSBD in early January 1963.
According to established FBI records now available, he had been on the lam for at least an entire year.
O,Reilly is a gasbag and everything he says has to be assumed inaccurate until proven otherwise.
What I have never seen really well analyzed is the possible participation of Soviet hardliners in their intelligence services.
It has never been explained to my satisfaction how and why a recent American veteran was allowed into the Soviet Union, how he wound up marrying and being able to bring his wife back to the United States.
This was after all during the Cold War which was possibly the most paranoid era in American history.
For Oswald to have been able to transport a weapon to the area where Kennedy was without being observed is totally unbelievable.
Just as many in this discussion have raised the possible involvement of various elements of the United States power structure, we should not forget that much of the Soviet power structure felt humiliated by the Cuban missile crisis.
It is not beyond the realm of possibility that there was collusion by these otherwise hostile groups.
I have no answers to the overall question of who shot Kennedy and why, but I have always been convinced that the real shooter was not Oswald, and that there was more of a motive than an unsatisfactory discharge from the USMC Vince October 15, 2012 at 21:48 haha I don’t think O’Reilly is that bad but I do feel that he took the easy way out in this book.
A lot of evidence put out by conspiracy theorists proves a cover-up after the fact but evidence proving that the CIA/Military was involved in a plot to actually kill JFK is lacking.
Oswald, if he was involved with anti-communists, could have been an infiltrator.
I think if he was involved with anti-communists in New Orleans, he was trying to infiltrate them.
James Angleton of the CIA kept a Soviet defector, who claimed the Soviets had nothing to do with the assassination, in solitary confinement for years trying to get him to confess that he was a Soviet plant and that Oswald was a soviet agent.
There are many questions still unanswered and I don’t think simply saying that “since the CIA covered up the fact that Oswald was not a lone gunman they must have been involved in the plot” is a sufficient answer.
Read everything Jerry Policoff ever wrote about the CIA media cover up of the JFK assassination.
W F Shea October 14, 2012 at 23:00 There is a mountain of evidence pointing to conspiracy, but there is one piece that should have blown the case wide open – the Oswald imposter.
Then there was the infamous phone call where he told LBJ in so many words that the guy in the custody of the Dallas PD was not the same guy on the Mexico City tapes.
The WC would no sooner squash one report of an imposter when up would pop another.
You have to hand it to them though, they did a remarkable job of discounting each and every one.
After the assassination, the limousine was taken back to the factory where the windshield and molding were both replaced.
These facts were also omitted in the Warren Commission Report to make sure the damage never occured.
Mr Teague was a bystander under the triple underpass and was struck on his cheek by a piece of pavement from the impact of another bullet.
In my view, the problem with the JFK case has always been the refusal of the mainstream press to countenance any serious objection or alternative to the Warren Report.
If the media actually carried the best critiques of the report, then the idea that Oswald killed Kennedy with this cheap Italian rifle, from the sixth floor–which he was not on at the time–hitting 2 of 3 direct hits, which the Commission knew was not possible, would evaporate.
O’Reilly and Dugard are trying to somehow make this thing acceptable again.
This is why I think Roger Ailes, who runs Fox News is the culprit here.
What is most egregious about Arlen Specter, besides his entire life of unprincipled political opportunism, is his criminal intimidation of Jean Hill in 1964.
In Dallas Texas on November 22, 1963, two women, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman were standing on the south side of Elm Street in Dealey Plaza as Kennedy’s motorcade passed.
They were two of the closest eyewitnesses to President Kennedy when he was struck with the fatal head shot.
Jean Hill would later be interviewed by Warren Commission attorney Arlen Specter.
He got angrier and finally told me, ‘Look, we can even make you look as crazy as Marguerite Oswald and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Jim Glover October 15, 2012 at 19:20 Hi James, My friend, Phil Ochs, who was the first person to tell me about the plot to kill Kennedy before it happened in 63 was working for Kissinger through an air force general in 74, two years before Phil hung himself.
Before the JFK coup he told me he was going to the Fair play for Cuba Committee to find out more.
Although Phil did not want his fans to know about his secret life he provided me with many Clues about the plot and may be why I found out so much and was positioned to be in Texas on that day and forced to witness key events during and after.
Now it is known that The FPCC was ordered to be infiltrated by Allen Dulles who I knew as a kid but he was pretending to be a Communist known to my Dad as Jack Leblanc but his club foot and smoking pipe gave him away to me.
Mikie has spent years on researching the Coup D’etat and his summation is right on.
An Attorney’s Evidentiary & Historical Analysis. by Michael Schweitzer on Thursday, September 15, 2011 at 4:35am Â· . by Michael B Schweitzer Attorney at Law Introductory note: This essay is a work-in-progress.
Deputy Director for Plans Richard M Helms and Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James J Angleton.
Dulles, a criminal mastermind, had lost his title when Kennedy fired him two years earlier for launching covert military operations to force him into wars.
But Dulles retained control of the secret inner circle he installed, and it included his chosen specialists.
The JFK assassination was a Helms-Angleton operation, code-named “The Big Event,” according to the deathbed confession of one of Dulles’ personal assistants in 1961, E Howard Hunt.
Johnson had positioned himself as Kennedy’s successor in 1960 by blackmailing Kennedy into nominating him for the vice presidency with evidence of Kennedy’s womanizing furnished by Johnson’s close friend and neighbor, FBI director J Edgar Hoover, so he may well have intended to kill Kennedy himself.
But greater powers intervened and preempted whatever LBJ may have had in mind.
Hunt, John Mecom and especially Clint Murchison â€“ enraged at Kennedy for proposing to eliminate a massive tax break for oilmen â€“ although Dulles had stronger ties to oilmen than Johnson, having long protected their interests as an attorney then as CIA director.
The killing itself was carried out by the United States Secret Service and long-time CIA Mafia contract shooters.
The operation ambushed the president in a Dallas motorcade by maneuvering his open limousine into a killing zone where four of thirteen bullets struck him from front and rear.
The members included Dulles, who took control and was in fact the only active member of the group.
The Commission’s Report mimicked the falsified FBI report Hoover provided it and pinned the blame a “lone nut” assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.
Oswald had worked for the FBI as a contract agent and was deceptively embraced as an asset, but loathed, by the CIA, which chose him as the patsy in Dallas.
As an attorney with 30 years’ experience researching law and evaluating evidence, I reject speculation.
I report my findings and, when necessary , my deductions with the highest probability of necessarily following from my findings.
For 2Â½ years now, starting in 2009, I have devoted more than 4,000 hours to researching the assassination of President Kennedy.
Then I organized this collection of disparate fragments in a fairly unique way â€“ not as pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, which is two-dimensional, but as connected dots, in a shape that more resembles a three-dimensional isotope, revealing linkages not otherwise visible by altering the angle of view.
Anyone can do the same, because all of the information is in the public domain â€“ but, as President Kennedy said he wanted to do to the CIA, splintered in a thousand pieces and scattered to the winds.
I do not pretend, to paraphrase that famous triple-redundancy they say in court, to have found the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
But I am confident I have drawn together sufficient evidence to offer this essay for your consideration.
Mainly because Kennedy was about to end the Cold War, an extraordinarily profitable enterprise for the military-industrial complex.
Kennedy became an outspoken peace advocate and called for nuclear disarmament.
He threatened to gut the profits of American’s most towering industrial and financial interests.
Both leaders had to go, and Dulles knew better than anyone outside the Kremlin that killing Kennedy would topple Khrushchev as well, because replacing Kennedy with hardliner Johnson would compel the Soviets to counter-move by installing their own hardliner, Leonid Brezhnev, which they did eleven months after the assassination.
The Cold War, about to end in Kennedy’s second term, continued for another profitable quarter of a century.
He overthrew the two most powerful governments on earth by killing just one man.
It reversed Kennedy’s NSAM 263, issued on October 11, 1963, that ordered all American military personnel withdrawn from Vietnam by the end of 1965.
Just four days after the assassination, the first concrete policy reversal emerged to enrich war profiteers.
It later became known the “official” was President Kennedy, who spoke the words to him one day earlier.
Kennedy often turned to his friend Krock to publish statements too politically explosive for him to speak as President.
President Dwight D Eisenhower appointed him as the first civilian CIA Director in March, 1953, shortly after taking office, on the advice of Ike’s friend and confidant Prescott Bush.
Bush, during WWII, had been one of Hitler’s American bankers until the FBI seized his bank, and both his son and grandson became United States presidents.
Dulles, a mysterious man with a documented Nazi past, in effect infiltrated the CIA as its first Nazi director.
President Harry S Truman had created the CIA as the intelligence arm of the Executive Branch by signing the National Security Act of 1947.
He invoked the 1949 Act so often, his covert operations consumed more than 80% of the Agency’s budget.
Although the 1949 Act shielded the CIA from almost any accountability, Dulles protected himself further by re-structuring the Agency horizontally from vertically, so no compartment would know what any other was doing.
And he used his new creation not to serve his country, but as the enforcement arm of the military-industrial complex.
Dulles had learned to profit from an intelligence post during World War II, when he ran a European office of the OSS while acting as intermediary for Hitler’s bankers.
His covert operations included two “regime changes” that turned democracies into dictatorships.
In Iran in 1953, he overthrew the Mossadegh government after it nationalized the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that controlled Iran’s oil industry.
After the coup, AIOC became British Petroleum and partnered with United States corporations for equal control of Iranian oil.
Then in Guatemala in 1954, he overthrew the Arbenz government after it initiated a land-reform program that re-distributed the country’s arable land to landless peasants.
Dulles had been a lawyer for United Fruit and held a personal stake in the outcome because he remained a major stockholder.
Dulles created MK-ULTRA in his first order as CIA director, on April 13,1953, and gave it 6% of the total CIA budget without any oversight.
Green,” was literally the cruelest man on earth, Auschwitz’ “Angel of Death” Josef Mengele.
Among many contributions to the project, according to a recently declassified CIA internal memorandum, Mengele disemboweled children in front of other children to desensitize them.
In 1973, then-CIA Director Richard Helms, tipped off about forthcoming investigations, ordered all MK-ULTRA project files destroyed.
But being an assassin, not a bureaucrat, he forgot the Agency kept accounting as well as project files, and in 1977, under a Freedom of Information Act request, 16,000 pages of overlooked MK-ULTRA financial records surfaced.
Dulles also planted infiltrators throughout the federal government, including every branch of the military, every investigative and other significant agency, and the White House.
Indeed, another recently declassified CIA internal memo reveals Dulles personally approved a murder contract with Johnny Roselli, second-in-command of the Chicago Mob under Sam Giancana.
Oswald, who had asked to wear a dark sweater before the transfer to conceal the lack of blood on black-and-white TV, groaned twice and dropped to the ground in an Oscar-worthy performance.
The CIA then double-crossed him in the ambulance and shot him for real.
Letting Oswald live would have kept questions alive for years â€“ during the prolonged process of trial and appeal â€“ which would not only have delayed legitimizing the Johnson presidency, but given the public time to think about what happened and a jury a chance to acquit.
Planners selected Ruby so the second killing, like the first, could be pinned on a “lone nut” gunman.
Ruby had to lunge at Oswald through a throng of police, reporters and photographers â€“ a multiplicity of variables to hinder him.
His mind was blank about everything he said and did during his encounter with Oswald, as if programmed by MK-ULTRA to auto-erase.
The Warren Commission itself concluded Oswald could have fired only three shots.
The Commission claimed a first shot missed and injured bystander James Tague with a flying curb fragment; a second entered the rear of Kennedy’s neck, exited his throat, entered Connally’s back, shattered a rib, exited Connally’s chest, shattered his right wrist, then penetrated his left thigh ; and a third hit Kennedy in the head.
Kennedy could only have said this BEFORE the throat-shot, because it took out his vocal chords.
Necessarily a separate, previous bullet struck him â€“ and not in the rear neck as the Warren Commission falsely claimed, but in the back six inches below the shoulders, as a Parkland Hospital photograph shows.
Moreover, all of the 40-or-so eye-witnesses to the head-shot swore they heard two shots, half-a-second apart â€“ necessarily raising the bullet count to five.
Incidentally, the last shot was an exploding projectile fired from the front that blew the president’s brains so far beyond the trunk of the car they splattered people behind it, and the famous Zapruder film shows First Lady Jacqueline stretch her arm to the far end of the trunk to retrieve a piece.
Six of the ten members of Kennedy’s Cabinet were sent out of the country before the assassination, on a flight to Japan that only one of them had to make, Secretary of State Dean Rusk.
Flying with them, for no reason, was Kennedy’s press secretary, Pierre Salinger â€“ an expert on motorcade security.
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and the Attorney General, Kennedy’s brother Robert.
They learned about the assassination from an old-fashioned telex â€“ and with no code book, only Johnson could run their Departments.
Meanwhile, McNamara, attending a budget meeting at the Pentagon, was never told by anyone there that Kennedy died.
He only learned about it 90 minutes later, when he received a personal phone call from Robert Kennedy.
Someone cleared a path for Johnson to run almost the entire federal government himself, without any impediment, for the first 24 hours after the assassination.
And also absent from the country during the assassination was the Joint Chief of Staff’s intermediary with the CIA, Col.
Only the CIA had the capability to carry out the assassination the way it happened.
It had long-standing relationships with Mafia leaders and engaged some of their finest contract killers to shoot the president.
The entire sequence of events displays the distinctive and brilliant hallmarks of Allen Dulles, as identifiable as an artist’s brushstrokes on a painting.
Hale Boggs, the member of the Warren Commission most dissatisfied with its findings, died in a mysterious airplane crash in Alaska on Oct.,1972.
He had blasted the FBI on the House floor the previous year â€“ on April 5, 1971 â€“ for using Gestapo tactics against opponents of federal policy.
Boggs was taken to the airport for the first leg of the trip by a young Democrat who later, as president, appointed Boggs’ wife, Lindy, as the United States Ambassador to the Vatican after she served 18 years in Congress after her husband disappeared.
This over-arching question is more difficult to answer because no tangible evidence exists.
Many people, including Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy, believed it was Lyndon Johnson, who coveted the presidency and blackmailed JFK into making him next in line.
Covering up the JFK assassination was only one of Lyndon Johnson’s dirty projects as president.
Goldberg had worked in United States intelligence during WWII and spied for President Franklin Roosevelt on wiretaps of Allen Dulles that monitored his Nazi activities.
The cover story for Justice Goldberg’s resignation was that Johnson urged him to replace the late Adlai Stevenson as Ambassador to the United Nations.
Disclosed by an apparent late-1970s Church Committee leak and reported for a day by a few alternative media outlets then never repeated is the way Stevenson died.
During a brief stop in London on July 14, 1965, he suddenly fell to the ground dead on the steps of the United States Embassy, shot in the neck by a CIA ice dart.
LBJ had ordered the first combat troops into Vietnam just three months earlier, on March 8, 1965 â€“ an escalation Stevenson opposed.
Others believe the CIA itself initiated the assassination at a very high level because Kennedy was determined to reform it, stripping it of all but its intelligence-gathering functions.
He certainly played an active part in the conspiracy by controlling the cover-up.
But I do not find credible his having control over the power centers in the government whose willing involvement the plot required.
Nor do I find credible the CIA deploying its vast resources to assassinate the President of the United States to serve Lyndon Johnson’s personal ambitions.
The CIA served the global geopolitical and profit interests of the most towering industrial and financial enterprises in the nation.
Self-indulgence like killing an American president out of personal spite would have contradicted the very reason for its existence.
Allen Dulles had molded the CIA to enforce the will of those private enterprises, who were his clients â€“ and remained so after he was sacked.
Their power exceeded Dulles’ , and Kennedy had initiated policies that imminently threatened their livelihoods.
I believe Dulles gave the “green light” to his loyal top-echelon insiders to kill the president.
Indeed, I consider Douglass’ insight a major breakthrough in understanding the magnitude of the conspiracy.
They are people who have names, and their names can be identified by deduction.
Like puppeteers pulling strings, their positions can be determined by observing the movements that result when they pull the strings.
Averell Harriman, who ordered the November 2, 1963 assassination of South Vietnam’s President Ngo Dinh Diem behind Kennedy’s back while Kennedy was vacationing in Hyannisport; John J McCloy, who controlled so many private and public institutions journalist Richard Rovere dubbed him “Chairman of the American Establishment”; and David S Rockefeller, Sr. â€“ but at the urging of someone else.
Rockefeller was the godfather of the only trillionaire family in America and its massive global oil, industrial, chemical, agribusiness and banking empire.
Starting in mid-1963, Kennedy hit him directly in the pocketbook, not once but three times.
On June 4, 1963, JFK issued Executive Order 11110, which stripped the privately-owned Federal Reserve Bank of its monopoly under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to create the nationâ€™s currency and loan it to the government at interest, and restored that constitutional power to the Treasury Department.
The Rockefeller, whose Chase Manhattan Bank was the Fedâ€™s second largest shareholder after the Bank of England, was burned worse than any other American.
Soviet Premier Khrushchev called it the best speech by an American president since Franklin Roosevelt and the next month negotiated the Atmospheric Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the first step in dismantling the military-industrial complex, another major source of Rockefeller income.
Dullesâ€™ first OSS headquarters was in the Rockefeller Center, and he had Rockefeller regularly briefed on CIA activities.
Rockefeller had a private advisor whose word was taken so seriously, once given it was followed.
Rockefeller’s advisor was Harvard’s star professor of geopolitical aggression Henry Kissinger â€“ an unexcelled master of multi-level strategic gamesmanship and slaughter.
If Rockefeller made a request of his old friend Allen Dulles to kill the president, he would have acted not only on the advice but at the urging of Kissinger.
Kissinger, more than any other player in the era of JFK’s peace initiatives, would have fathomed the criticality of removing Kennedy at once.
If this scenario is correct â€“ and none seem more realistic â€“ then David Rockefeller, Sr. was the man who tapped Dulles on the shoulder and set the machinery of the assassination in motion.
But Rockefeller’s action was initiated by the man behind the veil behind the curtain â€“ the true mastermind of the assassination of President John F Kennedy â€“ Henry Kissinger.
Stephen Courts Robert McCabe October 14, 2012 at 21:08 Interesting essay.The Shah of Iran was sick and needed help in American hospitals.Our country denied him access when David Rockefeller got him in right away.The Soviet Union had one of our high tech planes and would not return it to us when Harriman got it released right away.I do believe they represent the Power Elite as Churchill called them.I don’t by Kissinger although I see him as a horrible person.
There are a whole bunch of tapes, because Hoover didn’t realize that his phone has been tapped.
Mark October 14, 2012 at 17:02 The Israelis didn’t control the President’s security in Dallas.
Nice try but this is merely a diversion. charles caruso October 14, 2012 at 15:54 And check out Cabell mayor Dallas that day, a brother of three top CIA honchoes fired after Bay of Pigs.
I spent three days with O’Reilly, and trust me when I say he did not believe Oswald killed Kennedy.
He wanted to film DeMohrenschildt because DeMohrenschildt was going to blow the whistle on the whole deal in the upcoming HSCOA investigations.
O’Reilly was a pit-bull, and was prepared to blow the case wide open before the testimony.
G Sanford October 14, 2012 at 16:18 You know, I spent three days with John Wilkes Boothe, and if he had gotten a chance to write a book, I’m sure he would also have chosen a plot most likely to sell the most books.
He committed suicide, so they burned down the barn he was hiding in to get rid of the evidence… Come on.
If O’Reilly came out with a blockbuster revelation, it would sell a shitload of books.
His advantage is that he can huxter coffee mugs, dog sweaters, door mats or any other kind of faux patriotic claptrap junk he wants to, courtesy of his TV show.
It could have a transcription of “Dick and Jane” inside, and nobody would complain, because his audience is functionally illiterate.
Bush AND the Bouvier family, does not strike up a friendship with a guy like Oswald merely based on a mutual interest in stamp collecting.
THAT whole story stinks to high heaven. annalisa October 15, 2012 at 13:13 Ummm O’Reilly donates all of the money made from the “faux patriotic claptrap” to charity.
Americans and posters here are either not aware or silenced by a loyalty to Zionism and chose not to mention it.
By June 1963 JFK had finally reached the point of giving Israel an ultimatum on disclosing and dismantling its nuclear weapons programme.
Yes by mid-1963 JFK was well aware that David ben Gurion was pathological liar and terrorist.
JFK’s June 1963 letter to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, insisted on proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Israel was not developing nuclear weapons at its Dimona reactor facility.
Though his letter was cabled to the United States embassy, Ben-Gurion resigned before the message could be physically delivered.
JFK tried to stop Israel from starting a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and the greatest private donors to the development of Israelâ€™s nuclear bomb were private American citizens.
Kennedy, five months before his assassination signed off on Executive order #11110, which authorized the United States Treasury department to print silver-backed certificates, completely by-passing the private monopoly known as the Federal Reserve.
Robert McCabe October 15, 2012 at 20:10 Hi Frances,what I was trying to say is that all media in my opinion has to support the Warren Commission or they will find themselves without their millstone.Thanks.
You know, the type to finally put to bed all those absurd conspiracy theories of the past 50 years, etc etc.
I also eagerly look forward to seeing what a pile of , the new Tom Hanks film is.
Vince October 14, 2012 at 02:01 O’Reilly says JFK was not alone in the blame for the bay of pigs and that he would not have sent ground troops into Vietnam, though he did increase “advisors” by the thousands.
And JFK did have extramarital affairs so I’m not sure what “right wing mythology” to discredit Kennedy DiEugenio is speaking of.
James DiEugenio October 14, 2012 at 11:33 That is not an accurate statement.
And that JFK did this knowing the enterprise would likely now be doomed.
With the two declassified reports on the operation–Taylor Report and Kirkpatrick Report–it has now become evident that the D Day air strike was something that was added to the operation and not originally approved by Kennedy.
This is why Cabell asked to see Rusk before launching them in the first place.
In my upcoming rewrite of Destiny Betrayed, I spend a whole chapter on this issue.
This whole D Day cancellation was a myth created by Dulles and Hunt to shift the blame for the failure from CIA to Kennedy.
And when you add in all the deceptions I noted, that is what makes this such a bad book.
Vince October 14, 2012 at 23:44 Mr DiEugenio, I don’t disagree with your overall claim that the book did not offer anything new and insightful into the JFK assassination debate and that it actually noted “facts” that are indeed not true.
I don’t have the book in front of me so I can’t reference a page number but I am pretty sure he mentioned how the CIA deceived him on the chance of success.
I do know that I did not come away from the book with a sense that O’Reilly thought JFK caused it to fail on his own.
Also, I am almost positive the book says JFK was not planning a ground war in Vietnam.
The claim that Johnson inherited the problem of Vietnam in true but it does not mean he inherited an inevitable ground war.
I have read some of your articles on CTKA.net and you seem one of the more reasonable conspiracy theorists.
I find it hard to believe that numerous generals, officials in the CIA and the FBI, politicians, members of JFK’s own administration, and businessmen were all involved in a plot to kill JFK and no one credible ever talked.
I believe that the cover-up involved people covering their own asses because of their incompetence before the assassination but to say that everyone who covered it up had a role in killing Kennedy is not something I can believe.
Also, just because the military industrial complex profited from Vietnam,I don’t see how that can be proof of its involvement in JFK’s death.
I think by November 1963, JFK was holding his Vietnam policy close to the chest and the possibly of increasing military aid, etc was not totally off the table.
I think the claim by some conspiracy theorists that the generals and military industrial complex knew JFK was not going into Vietnam so they killed him is lacking in evidence.
JFK’s public claims on Vietnam were actually quite hawkish, it was his private ones that showed he was a practical cold warrior and that he was not going to fall into the same trap as the French.
I feel JFK was probably killed for his Cuba policy rather than Vietnam, since no one really knew what JFK was going to do in Southeast Asia except a select few.
I know you probably discuss a lot of it in your book but I figured I’d ask now and hope for a reply.
I also have a few questions on the assassination itself that no conspiracy theorist seems to want to answer.
They aren’t questions attacking conspiracy claims-they are just questions I feel need to be answered in order to get a clearer picture of the assassination.
James DiEugenio October 15, 2012 at 01:28 He does blame JFK for Bay of Pigs.
Early on he says that JFK is planning on withdrawing after he is re-elected.
There is little doubt, after the declassification of the Sec Def meeting of May 1963 that Kennedy was intent on getting out of Vietnam.
That record is a game changer that even convinced the NY TImes that JFK was planning on exiting.
Every military advisor to JFK–Bundy, McNamara, and Taylor–is now on record as saying Kennedy was getting out and LBJ changed the policy.
In the rewrite of my book, I do not state that any one issue was the reason for the assassination.
I try to present Kennedy as a break with the Cold War consensus that had developed through Truman, Acheson, Eisenhower and the Dulles Brothers.
How Kennedy opposed this from an early age through his talks with Edmund Gullion in Saigon in 1951.
And how his opposition evolved and strengthened by the time he became president.
I then show specifically where he broke with the national security state in several places.
I do see how he challenged the traditional order but he was not, in my opinion, a dove.
He realized that the status quo was not sustainable and that if things were not done to ease tensions, war would inevitably result.
Yet, he engaged in numerous traditional cold war policies, such as aggressive rhetoric, albeit mixed with reasons for hope of better relations.
He went after Castro with a vengeance and increased the defense budget.
His support for third world nationalism was a cold war policy to get those third world countries away from the Soviet banner.
He did change the reasons for some policies but he continued many inherited from Eisenhower and Truman.
Yes JFK hoped to end tensions with the Soviet Union but he did not want to do that at the expense of looking weak, in the eyes of Americans and Khrushchev.
I think his presidency is too complex and his actions so wild-ranging that calling him a hawk or a dove is a simplification.
In my new book I will use fur chapters at the beginning to define who JFK really was.
But as you will see, his policies were a clear break with what occurred before.
Oona October 13, 2012 at 21:58 There are a couple people who ought to be “waterboarded” for all the answers regarding JFK’s murder… they are Henry Kissinger and Arlen Spector. annalisa October 15, 2012 at 13:11 Ummm, Arlen Specter is dead.
Phyllis Bogren October 13, 2012 at 21:37 I starting reading the book yesterday.
Today, after reading the article written by Jim DiEugeio I have decided that I don’t need to finish the book.
I have enough half true statements coming from the media to last a life time.
Don’t tell me Dennis Miller is cut of the same cloth please………… Robert McCabe October 14, 2012 at 19:58 I am disappointed as well.My heritage is the same area as O’Reilly’s in Ireland I would like to think he hasn’t forgotten where he came from.
Frances in California October 15, 2012 at 19:22 I’m of Irish ancestry as well; ‘even have great grandparents sharing the name Reilly . . . but I wouldn’t patronize the pub that lets Bill drink there. archivista October 13, 2012 at 21:12 I’ve read many accounts of Hersh’s so-called “discrediting”, but have read nothing consequential in the discrediting itself.
This article is so close to Jessie Ventura’s conspiracy work that the author might like to explain his aversion to acknowledging it.
James DiEugenio October 13, 2012 at 23:37 Unlike O’Reilly and Dugard, my sources are footnoted in the essay itself.
The JFK case has nothing to do with liberal vs conservative orientation.
There are many people on the right, like Lew Rockwell, who don’t buy the Warren Report.
David Nilsson October 26, 2012 at 09:04 Let’s take down this Right Left angle once for all.
The claim that he was planning to pull out of SE Asia and leave South Nam to Ho Chi Minh is hooey; had he lived, the military industrial complex would have driven him to escalate as it did LBJ, though domestically Johnson was far more socialistic than Jack Kennedy.
Kennedy was eager to proselytize for Our Way of Life with arms if need be, and you can detect the beginnings of the neoliberal Scoop Jackson Democrat strain in his utterances.
The Old Right, such as Justin Raimondo of antiwar. com, and the paleolibertarians such as Lew Rockwell, detest United States interventionism and messianism more thoroughly than any soppy liberal Obama freak who excuses every Big Business war because we gotta get girls into school in Afghanistan or whaddever.
The old Republicans of the early 1960s, such as the Birchers and Barry Goldwater and those who had supported Taft over Ike, would have loathed the Cold War buildup and anti-commie crusading as much as any fellow traveler of the Left.
True conservatives know that ‘War is the Health of the State’ against the free man.
They would have urged that a USA that leaves other folks on other continents alone is in less danger of getting its presidents shot, unless it is by disgruntled armaments manufacturers, cheerleaders for foreign wars and such vermin.
Smedley Butler belatedly realised he’d spent his career in the Marines shilling for.
Today’s resurgent Ron and Rand Paul Right, like Adam Smith before him, has no illusions about the virtue and harmlessness of corporate conspirators.
I just picked up O’Reilly’s book to glance at while I was at Target and was immediately disappointed.
He had previously responded to a question about his book on “The O’Reilly Factor” and he stated that the book would examine the tough questions about the case.
In the 30 plus hours that the cops held him, he never uttered anything but protests of innocence.
The work done by yourself, Gaeton Fonzi, James Douglass, Jim Marrs, Jim Garrison and too many authors to name here underlines a conspiracy that has never been brought to justice but continues to be revealed layer by layer.
Case Closed, Reclaiming History or Killing Kennedy, when the truth was/has never been that clear.
Green October 13, 2012 at 18:08 In the category of “What’s New?”, Bill Oâ€™Reilly joins Norman Mailer and Stephen King in the JFK cover up.
There may be nothing more powerful than popular literature written by block buster authors to influence and solidify public opinion.
It’s just a guess, but I will ruin the surprise ending…Oswald did it. rosemerry October 13, 2012 at 17:50 Anyone who would believe the Warren Report probably accepts the official account of “9/11” as well.
Warren himself was ashamed of what he was forced to write, and hundreds of those involved in investigating the crime died mysteriously within a few years.
Le May was criminally insane; he recommended using genocide to win the cold war.
Kennedy lent encouragement for a film to be made of the book, but it came out too late, in 1964.
Air Force General Leon Johnson , who grew dahlias when not advocating mass murder, was Le Mayâ€™s parrot.
In JFK and the Unspeakable , Jim Douglass nominates a cabal of big business, big banks, big armaments makers, big military, big law, and big media, with the Central Intelligence Agency doing the dirty work.
Profit is the key to life; Profit is the clue; Profit is the drum and fife; And any war will do.
Kennedy refused to take the CIAâ€™s bait to invade Cuba after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in April 1961.
Douglass says Kennedy had to go because he gravely offended the unspeakable by seeking peace, not war, with Russia, Cuba and Vietnam.
He says Kennedyâ€™s murder on Friday, November 22, 1963 was arranged by Richard Helms , a former journalist who ran the CIAâ€™s Executive Action, a euphemism for removing, by murder or otherwise, leaders of countries which big bidness did not care for.
Douglass demonstrates beyond a peradventure that Lee Harvey Oswald lookalikes were used to falsely implicate Russia, Cuba and Oswald in the murder, and thus give the United States an excuse to have a nice war with those countries.
Lyndon Johnson disappointed the cabal; he did not take the bait to go to war with Russia and Cuba.
LBJ had foreknowledge, was a key plotter and was the critical player, besides J Edgar Hoover, in the cover up of the murder of John Kennedy.
Madeleine Duncan Brown was a mistress of Lyndon Johnson for 21 years and had a son with him named Steven Mark Brown in 1950.
Madeleine mixed with the Texas elite and had many trysts with Lyndon Johnson over the years, including one at the Driskill Hotel in Austin, TX, on New Year’s Eve 12/31/63.
He shot up out of bed and began pacing and waving his arms screaming like a madman.
November 17 October 13, 2012 at 16:02 The JFK assassination is no longer a mystery.
After Howard Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in, Alexander Haig was quickly linked to Howard Hunt.
Both men had worked on ultra-covert CIA operations against Castro and Cuba in the early sixties, so it was an easy connection to make.
The direct link between the military and the Agency will be guarded forever.
This is what makes the CIA the CIA — they never share this kind of information.
In 1962 and 1963, Alexander Haig, working in a CIA capacity as an aide to Army Secretary Cyrus Vance, arranged for Howard Hunt to serve as the mastermind.
Together they turned a supposed anti-Castro assassination plot into an anti-Kennedy assassination plot.
Nine years later, when Howard Hunt was linked to the Watergate break-in, Alexander Haig used people like Bob Woodward to steer the investigations away from the CIA and towards Richard Nixon’s reelection committee.
If you’ve been wondering what could possibly be in all of those still-classified JFK & Watergate CIA files, now you know.
For the rest of the Watergate-JFK story, don’t waste your time with people like Bill O’Reilly.
It’s also meant to deter and intimidate people not to question official government accounts of events, of which he and his fellow liars and shills at FOX help shape and sell to the public.
Robert McCabe October 15, 2012 at 12:56 Everybody in media is. annalisa October 15, 2012 at 13:10 Well that just tears it for me.
Betty Harris October 13, 2012 at 14:07 Read FAMILY OF SECRETS if you want some serious information.
At a time when you could be blacklisted for even knowing anyone with supposed communist ties.
That single fact alone should make it glaringly obvious that Oswald was an agent of the United States intelligence services and never actually defected.
I was feeling very comfortable this afternoon until I read this article.
But the one rational conclusion I have about the “sins of Roger Ailes” is that if it is on Faux Noose, or comes from one of their puppets, then it is a lie.
Despite the massive anxieties caused by the details of Jim DiEugenio’s comments, if they disagree with the “facts” of Bill O’Reilly , they the disagreement must be Gospel.
JFK and The Unspeakable Why He Died and Why It matters by James Douglass.
Dawn Robert McCabe October 14, 2012 at 19:39 Kenny O’Donnell and Dave Powers two of President Kennedy’s best friends rode in a car the day of the murder and saw the killers fire and were told to not say a word.This is well known information that O’Reilly if he had any decency would have included in his book.I don’t believe this book will go anywhere as so much of the truth is well known today.
Robert Morrow October 15, 2012 at 03:05 Kenny Oâ€™Donnell, one of JFKâ€™s closest aides, told Tip Oâ€™Neil that he perjured himself in front of the Warren Commission by not saying he that heard two shots come from behind the stockade fence on the Grassy Knoll.
Dave Powers, another close aide also heard a shot from the FRONT; he was intentionally ignored by the Warren Commission con artists.
Dave Powers and Kenney Oâ€™Odonnell were 2 of JFKâ€™s very closest aides.
My reaction in part is reconstruction—is that they came from the right rear.
But five years after Jack died, I was having dinner with Kenny Oâ€™Donnell and a few other people at Jimmyâ€™s Harborside Restaurant in Boston, and we got to talking about the assassination.
I was surprised to hear Oâ€™Donnell say that he was sure he had heard two shots that came from behind the fence.
Jym Allyn October 15, 2012 at 09:07 I am extremely glad that I came back to this page to read the additional comments.
Even though, the main thing that those comments accomplished was to INCREASE my level of anxiety.
UDVbtaNbfcs What is stunning is to read all of the comments from “whacko conspiracists” and to sense how rational and thoughtful they are as to their details and rationality.
All of this reinforces my paranoid suspicion as to the “real reason” why Obama “blew” the first Presidential debate with Romney.
Colin Powell decided NOT to run for President because his wife did not want to be the widow of the first African-American President assassinated in office.
While all of the Kennedy-conspiracy theorists may have their suspicions about a CIA-involved conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy, President Obama likely has details that would either refute or validate those suspicions.
If those details validate the suspicions, it is likely that President Obama was THE most terrified person in the room as he was acknowledging the 20th anniversary of marrying Michelle.
If he is not assertive enough in the debate, and Romney wins, then he gets to enjoy the perks of being the ex-President as exemplified by Bill Clinton.
If he says too much, too well, and wins the Presidency, then Michelle might become a widow.
That distraction could have had a far more significant impact on Obama’s weak presentation that the purported effect of the higher altitude of Denver.
There was an outpouring of criticism of him for this despicable representation of the facts.
Amazingly, a short tome later, he repeated the same falsehood to bolster another one of his specious arguments.
I guess Americans think that O’Reilly is the kind of guy who should have more money, so they’ll buy his book to make sure he gets it.
Rewarding hypocrites for their false patriotism is the hallmark of the right wing.
Morton Kurzweil October 13, 2012 at 13:03 The same religion, different sins.
