This version has been updated and revised beyond what was originally published in this issue.
The Nation Magazine has long been one of the most perceptive and eloquent voices for skepticism in publishing.
Its revelations over the years have established it as one of the few national media outlets that truly functions as a watchdog in the public interest.
It has always been an early voice, often the first, to question official pronouncements &amp;ndash; on Vietnam, on Watergate, on Iran-Contra, on Guatemala, on Haiti, and Chile.
But on JFK&#039;s murder, The Nation has inexplicably kept shut the skeptical eye it normally keeps cocked at outfits like FBI, the CIA and the military &amp;ndash; the very groups it has so often caught lying, and the very groups that produced virtually all the evidence the Warren Commission said disproved conspiracy.
The Nation raised nary an eyebrow at the apparent ease with which the FBI was able to prove right FBI boss J Edgar Hoover&#039;s astounding clairvoyance &amp;ndash; announced on the very night JFK died and before any investigation &amp;ndash; that Lee Harvey Oswald had done it all by himself.
Given that the public hasn&#039;t believed the Warren Commission since the late 60s, and since its no-conspiracy verdict was officially reversed in 1978 by the House Select Committee , it is hard to fathom why The Nation, of all magazines, continues to toe the old line.
In recent years, its in-house experts have been Alexander Cockburn and Max Holland.
Skeptics like Peter Dale Scott and John Newman, whose credentials far surpass those of Cockburn and Holland in this case, have been restricted to limited responses on the letters-to-the-editor page.
It was but a &#039;fantasy that Kennedy was on the verge of pulling out from Vietnam.
Early signs are that Holland intends to use the Kennedy case to deliver a sweeping, extraordinary history and civics lesson to the public.
After what the Boston Globe described five years ago as &#039;one of the most exhaustive examinations ever conducted into the Warren Commission&#039;s investigation,&#039;5 Holland announced that, &#039;It&#039;s become part of our popular culture that the Warren Commission was a joke, and that&#039;s not the case.
Holland has written that ignorance, &#039;cunningly manufactured falsehoods,&#039; and paranoia &amp;ndash; but not a suspiciously inadequate investigation &amp;ndash; have conspired to unjustly darken the reputation of the Warren Commission&#039;s &#039;no-stone-unturned&#039; murder investigation.
In taking down the Warren Commission, malicious and stupid skeptics have spawned a corrosive public cynicism not only about the government&#039;s honest answer to the Crime of the Century in 1964, but also about government in general.
Holland Face to Face Here I must own up to some personal history with Max Holland.
On September 13, 1999, I made a formal presentation at The Nation on some of the new JFK medical/autopsy evidence.
The goal of that meeting was to update The Nation on some of the JFK disclosures that had already gotten coverage in outlets like the Washington Post and AP, and to bring some then-unpublished material to the attention of the editors.
Newman projected documents showing that Oswald had been impersonated in taped conversations recorded by the CIA in Mexico City six weeks before JFK&#039;s death.
Newman showed declassified FBI and CIA documents proving that at least one phone recording to the Russian embassy survived after 11/22/63, despite both the CIA and the FBI later claiming that no such tapes had ever survived routine erasure and recycling.
Nor did they ever pipe up to refute the CIA&#039;s claim no tapes survived the assassination.
Holland scoffed that any tapes had survived; apparently unaware the story had already been publicly confirmed.
John Armstrong gave his usual dramatic presentation of documents showing that on numerous occasions there were two different &#039;Oswalds&#039; appearing simultaneously in different locations.
Milicent Cranor provided strong evidence of what was behind autopsy pathologist James Humes&#039; false testimony concerning Kennedy&#039;s throat incision.
It&#039;s quite another matter when more than 80% of Americans disbelieve or cannot accept their own history, and when the questions they ask about the past are based on palpable, cunningly manufactured falsehoods.
Almost any claim or theory, regardless of how bizarre or insupportable, now be presented in the same sentence as the Warren Report&#039;s conclusions and gain credence.
He&#039;s vexed at the reception of Oliver Stone&#039;s pro-conspiracy film JFK, and the favor accorded pro-conspiracy books by authors such as Peter Dale Scott and former House Select Committee counsel Gary Cornwell.
The lead piece actually asserted that &#039;on the complex question of the Kennedy assassination itself, the film holds its own against the Warren Report.
Virtually no one truly grasps the unique Cold War circumstances in which both the President&#039;s murder and its investigation transpired.
The deranged act of a lonely, pro-Cuban zealot, he maintains, was the unintended consequence of Kennedy&#039;s rabid anti-Castroism.
In essence, Kennedy got from Oswald what he&#039;d intended to give Castro through the agency of the CIA and Mafia.
But not from the target of Kennedy&#039;s malice, Castro, but instead from a delusional, self-appointed pro-Castro avenger.
The government&#039;s well-intended decision to protect the public from the seamier aspects of this scenario explains why the public has never understood the whole picture.
So, sure, the government hid facts about Oswald and about the CIA&#039;s plots to murder Fidel Castro.
The secrets were kept, Holland argues, not to deny the basic truth of JFK&#039;s death, but instead to calm an electrified public and protect secret, vital, and ongoing, Cold War operations. &#039;he 2 percent doesn&#039;t contradict the Warren Report; like the information omitted by the CIA and Robert Kennedy in 1964, it only helps to affirm Oswald&#039;s sole guilt.
Holland believes that RFK, to protect the Kennedy name, and his own political future, repeatedly blocked the very avenues of investigation whose sloppy coverage in 1964 is taken as proof today that the Warren Commission got it wrong.
So, in Holland&#039;s eyes, if the Warren Commission was not entirely successful, the Kennedys deserve no small portion of blame.
As examples, Holland maintains that RFK prevented JFK&#039;s autopsy doctors from dissecting the President&#039;s back wound, and so the proof of an Oswald-implicating trajectory was lost.
Also lost was the public&#039;s confidence in the post mortem&#039;s conclusions that only two shots, both fired from the rear, hit their mark.
Besides that, RFK never told the Commission about murderous CIA plots undertaken under his command to have the Mob whack Castro, while he preserved his option to plausible deny his own role.
Thus, Holland says, it was that the ferociously anti-Castro president inadvertently inspired a communist loser&#039;s vengeful act.
RFK then orchestrated a protective cover-up of his brother&#039;s death, leaving a legacy of public skepticism that continues to undermine faith in honorable public institutions to this day.
The Seductions Of Paranoia Ignorance of the bigger picture, whether because of Kennedy subterfuge or for other reasons, is not the only explanation Holland offers for the widely held skepticism.
Schleshinger, Holland tells us, &#039;manipulates history as if he were a lifetime employee of the Kennedy White House,&#039; enthusiastically feeding the Kennedy Camelot myth, &#039;his eloquence in the writing of history rivaled only by his skill in dissembling it.
But when myths are as divorced from reality as these are, they become dangerous.
Americans are encouraged to feel nostalgia for a past that never was, wax dreamily about what might have been, or indulge in elaborate paranoid fantasies about their own government.
Holland concludes that the &#039;outstanding characteristics&#039; of Scott&#039;s book Deep Politics, &#039;put it squarely in the tradition of most books about the assassination ... an unreadable compendium of &#039;may haves&#039; and &#039;might haves,&#039; non sequiturs, and McCarthy-style innuendo, with enough documentation to satisfy any paranoid.
In the introduction to an article about Garrison that appeared in the spring 2001 issue of the Wilson Quarterly, Holland hangs virtually all responsibility for America&#039;s loss of faith in public institutions on the district attorney.
Of all the legacies of the 1960s, none has been more unambiguously negative than the American public&#039;s corrosive cynicism toward the federal government.
Well before antiwar protests were common, lingering dissatisfaction with the official verdict that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone broadened into a widespread conviction that the federal government was incompetent or suppressing the truth or, in the worst case, covering up its own complicity in the assassination.
None other than the fiendishly clever chaps in the Russian KGB, whose clever conspiracy only succeeded in seducing the public because of the gullibility of a vainglorious dupe, Jim Garrison.
Holland says that in 1967 the KGB slipped a bogus story into a &#039;crypto-Communist&#039; Italian newspaper, Paese Sera, that tied Clay Shaw to an a CIA front organization in Italy, &#039;Centro Mondiale Comerciale.
From there, events followed an inexorable, downward spiral as Garrison painted an incredible courtroom sketch of Shaw and Oswald clutched in the CIA&#039;s malefic embrace as they danced toward destiny in Dallas.
Had Garrison not gone wobbly on the KGB&#039;s concoction, Holland believes that the Shaw-CIA-Oswald fairy tale would have vanished like a dream, taking the nightmarish prosecution of Shaw with it.
The final upshot was a senseless catastrophe for Shaw, and a loss of faith in America.
Holland, it should be emphasized, does not deny that some cynicism about government is justified.
Vietnam, other assassinations, Watergate, exposure of FBI and CIA abuses in the 1970s, and finally the Iran-contra scandal, all of which undermined Americans&#039; trust in their elected government.
For not only on the Kennedy case is it true that, &#039;a more sophisticated or mature understanding is necessary among the public to realize that the government does keep secrets, but it doesn&#039;t mean that what they say isn&#039;t the truth.
But the government&#039;s problem is that, as with any proven liar, the government has already been caught telling myriad, big lies, and it takes only a few small lies to foster an atmosphere of mistrust.
The suppression of information about our use of high-tech spy balloons, he says, allowed flying-saucer and conspiracy buffs to &#039;adorn the Roswell incident with mythic significance.
And in the Kennedy case, &#039;he assassination and its aftermath have never been firmly integrated into their place and time, largely because of Cold War exigencies.
First, the public didn&#039;t &#039;adorn&#039; the Roswell incident with paranoid mythic significance because the government told the truth but not the whole truth; it did so because the government invited farfetched theorizing by offering three different &#039;factual&#039; explanations for what really happened there, at least two of which were lies.
A more &#039;sophisticated understanding&#039; doesn&#039;t lead one to trust the government more, as Holland would have it, but less.
Confining his gaze to the myriad government conspiracies betokened by the words Vietnam, Watergate, Iran-Contra, and CIA and FBI abuses, doesn&#039;t give the government its due.
And it doesn&#039;t reflect the changing nature of what properly constitutes &#039;paranoia&#039; today.
Since Hofstadter delivered his famous lecture in 1963, &#039;paranoia&#039; has been beating a steady retreat.
Had Hofstadter read in 1963 that in 1962 the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff had unanimously approved a plan to commit acts of terrorism against U S. citizens on American soil, he might have withheld his sermon on the foolhardiness of paranoia.
ABC recently publicized the story that was first disclosed in investigative reporter, James Bamford&#039;s book, Body of Secrets.
In a once-secret operation codenamed Operation Northwoods, ABC.com reported that, &#039;America&#039;s top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in United States cities to create public support for a war ... to oust Cuba&#039;s then new leader, communist Fidel Castro.
In the year Hofstadter spoke, it would have been considered pure paranoia to believe &amp;ndash; especially after the Nuremberg convictions of Nazis for grotesque human experiments &amp;ndash; that our government was then conducting and covering-up ongoing dangerous and secret drug, LSD, radiation and syphilis experiments on unwitting, law-abiding, American citizens.
On July 28, 2002, AP reported, &#039;For more than 20 years, FBI headquarters in Washington knew that its Boston agents were using hit men and mob leaders as informants and shielding them from prosecution for serious crimes including murder.
The moral callousness exhibited in the United States response to these disclosures is shocking.
He was encouraging Americans to feel nostalgic for a past that never was, to wax dreamily about what might have been.
And he discouraged &#039;paranoid fantasies&#039; about government that were often vastly less &#039;paranoid&#039; than the suppressed reality.
If Holland is right that there is a &#039;widespread conviction&#039; that the federal government has suppressed the truth or covered up its own complicity in myriad, lawless acts, that conviction exists entirely independently of the efforts of Schleshinger, Stone, Scott and Garrison.
In fact, so many deplorable government conspiracies have been proven that Hofstadter would never have dreamed of, most detailed eloquently in The Nation, one can&#039;t help but wonder if conspiracy-exorcist Holland ever reads even the magazine he writes for.
The True History of a Remarkable Investigation By putting the &#039;extraordinary investigation&#039; into its historical context, it appears Holland expects to redeem the checkered reputation of Earl Warren&#039;s most famous accomplishment.
In time the Warren Commission will be seen for what it truly was ... a monumental criminal investigation carried to its utmost limits and designed to burn away a fog of speculation.
It did not achieve perfection, and in the rush to print the language on pivotal issues, such as the single bullet, was poorly crafted ... the accuracy of the report&#039;s essential findings, holding up after three decades, is testimony to the commission&#039;s basic integrity.
The Wisdom of LBJ&#039;s Tricky Balancing Act Holland attributes much of the Commission&#039;s success to the wily LBJ, whose conscription of two reluctant appointees was especially inspired.
Chief Justice Earl Warren and Senator Richard Russell, staunch political enemies, were essentially coerced.
If Warren, a liberal Republican, could cobble together a consensus conclusion about the tragedy with a well-respected political enemy, the conservative Democrat Russell, there would be no doubting the fundamental integrity of the investigation and the nonpartisan nature of the conclusions.
In about forty-eight hours the intercepts showed beyond a reasonable doubt that both the Soviet and Cuban governments had been as shocked as anyone by the news from Dallas.
And yet the Commission has been criticized for having been too reliant on the intelligence apparatus, rather than on its own independent investigators.
I mean they went out in the field, they interviewed witnesses, they deposed witnesses, they conducted a first hand evaluation of evidence ... you can say weren&#039;t trained homicide investigators &amp;ndash; that&#039;s true &amp;ndash; but the FBI didn&#039;t also investigate a lot of murders either.
Murder was a state problem ... so, number one, the staff of the Warren Commission were investigators.
Hoover signed an affidavit saying the Bureau had never recruited or attempted to recruit Oswald.
Instead, Holland holds that not only did the investigation greatly benefit from the remarkable data federal snoops gathered, the Commission was also satisfactorily able to cross check any important information from them it doubted.
The Commission was a splendid, if imperfect, national effort to solve the JFK&#039;s murder, but it doesn&#039;t get the respect it deserves because of the misunderstandings, lies and paranoia of critics.
It isn&#039;t surprising that such a novel defense has never been tried before by anyone &amp;ndash; except, perhaps, by ex-Commissioners Gerald Ford and David Belin.
Those critiques, it should be noted, bear an eerie similarity to the critiques of skeptics such as historian Michael Kurtz, journalist Henry Hurt, Sylvia Meagher, Notre Dame law professor and former HSCA chief counsel, Robert Blakey, Peter Dale Scott, as well as many others.
There is no denying that the Commission learned little about Oswald&#039;s associates.
Though the FBI had Jack Ruby&#039;s phone records, it failed to spot Ruby&#039;s suspicious, and atypical, pattern of calls to known Mafiosi in the weeks leading up to the assassination.
The Commission&#039;s &#039;investigators&#039; didn&#039;t know enough to triple-check the FBI, or to check themselves, and so the Commission learned next to nothing about Ruby, or his calls.
Basing its conclusions on FBI-supplied &#039;character references&#039; from, among others, two known mob associates ,40 the Commission ultimately concluded Ruby was not connected to the mob.
Then in 1977, the HSCA performed the rudimentary task of actually analyzing Ruby&#039;s calls and exposing Lenny Patrick&#039;s and Dave Yaras&#039; mob ties.
It made the obvious connection &amp;ndash; one that fit other compelling, and previously ignored, evidence that tied Ruby to the Mafia, and the Mafia to the crime.
The importance of this reversal was entirely lost on Holland, who wrote, &#039; corroborated every salient fact developed by the Warren Commission.
Instead, the Bureau turned to FBI supervisor Regis Kennedy, who then professed to believe Carlos Marcello, the New Orleans capo to whom Ruby had ties, was a &#039;tomato salesman and real estate investor.
And so, &#039;The Commission did not investigate Hoover or the FBI, and managed to avoid the appearance of doing so.
The Commission never heard about the mafia threats against JFK and RFK that had been picked up in FBI wiretaps.
Two years before the HSCA issued its report, the Senate Select Committee reported on its own examination of the process employed by both agencies.
It reported, &#039;The Committee has developed evidence which impeaches the process by which the intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the assassination, and by which they provided information to the Warren Commission.
This evidence indicates that the investigation of the assassination was deficient and that facts which might have substantially affected the course of the investigation were not provided the Warren Commission or those individuals within the FBI and the CIA, as well as other agencies of Government, who were charged with investigating the assassination.
That is, two government bodies that &amp;ndash; armed in abundance with the one key capacity the Commission needed but lacked, a staff of experienced and proven criminal investigators &amp;ndash; uncovered good reasons to incline any reasonable person toward skepticism.
The Warren Report The list of Commission shortcomings the HSCA assembled is not short.
To cite a particularly important one, the HSCA found that, &#039;Even though staff was composed primarily of lawyers, the Commission did not take advantage of all the legal tools available to it.
For although they admitted doubting, and with good reason, the truthfulness of some of the witnesses, the Commissioners freely admitted they never once found even a single occasion to offer a grant of immunity to pursue their only client.
The HSCA&#039;s chief counsel, Robert Blakey, an experienced criminal investigator and prosecutor himself, was impressed with neither the Commission&#039;s vigor nor its independence.
In essence, the HSCA concluded that Hoover had divined the solution to the crime before the investigation, and then Hoover&#039;s agents proved his epiphany.
Despite the Commission&#039;s admission that it would probably need an independent investigative staff to properly investigate certain intelligence &#039;tender spots,&#039; it chose not to get one.
As the HSCA succinctly put it, &#039;he Commission did not go much beyond the agencies in investigating the anticipated &#039;tender spots.
Complaining in The Nation that HSCA deputy chief counsel Gary Cornwell &#039;recycles some of the hoariest clich&amp;eacute;s regarding the Warren Commission ,&#039;58 Holland seems disinclined to accept any of the HSCA&#039;s critique of the Commission.
I had investigated numerous conspiracies, and indicted and tried the organized crime members who participated in those conspiracies, including the head of the Mafia in Kansas City, and the head of the Mafia in Denver.
Unlike Tom Wicker, my bias ran toward a belief that conspiracies are a very integral part of &#039;how the world works.
It is still celebrated even today for having revealed prior, gross intelligence failures, lies and abuses committed by the same agencies that Holland hails for having cracked the Kennedy case.
The Church committee, moreover, did not &#039;disqualify&#039; itself by having disagreed with the Warren Commission&#039;s conclusions about Oswald.
It only addressed the manner in which JFK&#039;s murder was investigated.
The pressure to issue a report that would establish Oswald as the lone assassin is reflected in internal Bureau memoranda.
On 11/24/63, Assistant FBI Director Alan Belmont informed Associate FBI Director Clyde Tolson that he was sending to Headquarters supervisors to Dallas to review &#039; ... so that we can prepare a memorandum to the Attorney General ... out the evidence showing that Oswald is responsible for the shooting that killed the President.
Apparently Commissioner McCloy&#039;s word &amp;ndash; &#039;We are so dependent on for our facts&#039; &amp;ndash; accounts for nothing with Max Holland.
His retort is that the FBI did work satisfactorily with the Commission, which was not overly dependent on the Bureau.
The Commission, you see, independently double-, or triple-checked any important FBI evidence it doubted.
The Commission and its staff did analyze the material and frequently requested follow-up agency investigations; but if evidence on a particular point was not supplied to the Commission, this second step would obviously not be reached, and the Commission&#039;s findings would be formulated without the benefit of any information on the omitted point.
Internal records suggest that rather than truth being its only bias, the Warren Commission&#039;s bias was to believe what the FBI said was true.
From the record, author Howard Roffman has pointed to a clear inclination on the Commission&#039;s part that existed before it had begun its investigation.
Now, Rankin and Warren drew up the plans for the organization of the work that the staff was to undertake for the Commission.
It would evaluate the evidence from the perspective of &quot;Oswald as the assassin,&quot; and it would search for his &quot;possible motives.&quot; Attached to Warren&#039;s &quot;Progress Report&quot; was a copy of the &quot;Tentative Outline of the Work of the President&#039;s Commission.&quot; This outline reveals in detail the extent to which the conclusion of Oswald&#039;s guilt was pre-determined.
Section II, &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy,&quot; begins by outlining Oswald&#039;s movements on the day of the assassination.
Under the heading &quot;Murder of Tippit,&quot; there is the subheading &quot;Evidence demonstrating Oswald&#039;s guilt.&quot; Even the FBI had refrained from drawing a conclusion as to whether or not Oswald had murdered Officer Tippit.
Yet, at this very early point in its investigation, the Commission was convinced it could muster &quot;evidence demonstrating Oswald&#039;s guilt.&quot; Another heading under Section II of the outline is &quot;Evidence Identifying Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy,&quot; again a presumptive designation made by a commission that had not yet analyzed a single bit to evidence.
With Earl Warren confident in the FBI&#039;s solution so early in the game, Warren critic Dwight McDonald made an insightful comment in 1965 on how the rest of the chips so easily fell into place.
He described the young and inexperienced staff counsels who actually did the Warren Commission&#039;s legwork, as, &#039;ambitious young chaps who were not going to step out of the lines drawn by their chiefs.
Alan Dershowitz reported that one-time Commission attorney, Stanford law professor John Hart Ely, &#039;has acknowledged that the ommission lacked independent investigative resources and thus was compelled to rely on the government&#039;s investigative agencies, namely the FBI, CIA and military intelligence.
HSCA counsel Robert Blakey reported, &#039;When asked if he was satisfied with the investigation that led to the conclusion, he said he was not.
As the The Athens Observer, put it in a story published on 12/8/94, &#039;A recording released earlier this year by the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library has brought to light some important new facts concerning the Warren Commission&#039;s investigation of the assassination of President John F Kennedy.
As a result of disclosure of the recording it is now evident, more than three decades after the assassination, that President Lyndon B Johnson and three members of the Warren Commission rejected the so-called single bullet theory, an essential part of the Commission&#039;s single-assassin thesis.
In Cornwell&#039;s tendentious account , this memo becomes documentary proof of an effort to &#039;put the machinery of government into gear to make the lone, deranged assassin story a convincing one.
Writing presidential assistant Bill Moyers, Katzenbach urges that, &#039;the public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not have confederates who are still at large; and that the evidence was such that he would have been convicted at trial.
Cornwell&#039;s case that the &#039;machinery of government&#039; was prematurely set in motion against Oswald does not, as Holland intimates, rest solely on Katzenbach&#039;s memo.
It rests instead on multiple lines of evidence Cornwell elucidates, but which Holland ignores, including some sworn statements from Katzenbach.
Holland, for example, ignores that Katzenbach nowhere recommended that the backstop Presidential Commission actually investigate the murder, only that it &#039;review and examine the evidence and announce its conclusions.
Cornwell&#039;s discussion of the early, official bias against Oswald draws from multiple sources, and is perfectly reflected by Katzenbach himself in his own memo.
It is for that reason that Cornwell&#039;s interpretation of the memo is the standard account of it.
It is no coincidence that this same &#039;tendentious&#039; interpretation was also reached by the Senate Select Committee in 1976,79 by the HSCA in 1978, and others.
Defending the deputy A G., Holland argued that, &#039;Katzenbach has acknowledged that his memo may have been worded inartfully.
But in no sense was he arguing for a pre-cooked verdict, and to believe, in any case, that J Edgar Hoover&#039;s FBI obeyed diktats from lowly deputy attorneys general is absurd.
But the record Holland ignores is that, rather than Hoover obeying his boss, it was his boss who was obeying &#039;diktats&#039; from the subordinate.
And as Michael Kurtz has observed, the day before Katzenbach wrote his memo, Hoover called presidential adviser Walter Jenkins and said, as if anticipating Katzenbach&#039;s memo, &#039;The thing I am concerned about, and so is Mr Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.
The nation must to a degree take it on faith that we who lead the CIA are honorable men, devoted to the nation&#039;s service.
In his book Bay of Pigs &amp;ndash; The Untold Story,90 Peter Wyden reminds us that JFK repeatedly made it clear he wanted no American men landing on the beaches during the Cuban invasion.
Anthony Summers has described how the CIA refused to honor several requests from Richard Nixon to see the internal investigation of the Bay of Pigs discussed above, the scathing post mortem critique of the invasion conducted by the CIA&#039;s own Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick.
This is not the only example of Agency deception undertaken to prevent exposure of its own lapses.
In a 1995 National Public Radio story entitled, &#039;CIA Passed Tainted Info to the President in the 80&#039;s.
The episode provoked Senator Arlan Specter to charge that the CIA disinformation had cost the U S. &#039;billions of dollars&#039; in needless military purchases.
Holland thus exaggerates a bit when he endorses Dulles, asserting that the CIA was &#039;the President&#039;s personal instrument, for good or ill, during the cold war.
Instead, what may really be inconceivable is that anyone could look at the record and still believe that the CIA was the President&#039;s personal instrument, for good or ill, during the Cold War.
Holland Examines The Evidence Since neither Cockburn nor Holland is expert on the Kennedy assassination, they&#039;ve relied upon others.
The expert Alex Cockburn featured in The Nation was a faithful Warren Commission counsel, Weslie Liebeler, who both Warren critics and loyalists alike can be forgiven for regarding as less than the most objective, or even close to the best, source.
One of Holland&#039;s trusted experts is Gerald Posner, the controversial author of the anti-conspiracy book Case Closed.
According to Holland, Posner has &#039;exhaustively and patiently debunked every canard posited to date about the assassination.
Writing in the peer-reviewed Journal of Southern History, Historian David Wrone, a widely respected authority102 Posner deferentially cites, said Posner&#039;s book &#039;stands as one of the stellar instances of irresponsible publishing on this subject.
Even the recently disbanded panel of civilian historians hired by the government to declassify millions of once secret records &amp;ndash; the JFK Review Board &amp;ndash; took a whack at Posner in their final report, after Posner stonewalled two personal requests from the Board for information.
In the few instances in which he actually discusses specific evidence, Holland places too great a reliance on dubious sources and incautious speculation.
One of his favorite authorities is Gerald Posner, author of the book Case Closed.
Holland says Posner makes it &#039;exhaustively clear ... that Oswald had no accomplices and there was no conspiracy,&#039;106 and Posner, &#039;exhaustively and patiently debunks every canard posited to date about the assassination.
Such a shot allows Oswald enough time to reload and shoot again by Zapruder 224, an interpretation that favors Oswald&#039;s guilt.
The Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination shows a little girl in a red dress and white coat running alongside the motorcade while the president and Mrs.
Shortly before the president is obviously wounded, this little girl stops abruptly in her tracks.
I believe, as many other students of the subject do, that this loud noise was in fact the first shot, and that it missed the occupants of the limousine entirely.
Thus Holland offers as evidence of Oswald&#039;s guilt the misinterpreted motions of this single person, while ignoring far more credible accounts of numerous other witnesses who place the first shot at circa Z-180-195.
Ironically, one of these accounts happens to include the testimony of his star witness&#039;s father, Phil Willis.
The elder Willis specifically refuted his the Posner/Holland interpretation.
He also told the Warren Commission that the first shot &#039;caused me to squeeze the camera shutter.
But Holland remains mute about the senior Willis, if he even knows about him at all.
And he is mute about the fact that not a single person visible in the Zapruder film reacts as early as would be required to allow Oswald to fire again by Z-224.
Borrowing from Holland&#039;s astute observation about author Gus Russo, it is clear that, whether a witness like Rosemary, or a writer Gerald Posner, Holland, like Russo, is also &#039;not much inclined to take a hard look at sources he likes.
Quoting Jackie Kennedy, Holland writes, &#039;&#039;It&#039;s &amp;ndash; it had to be some silly little Communist.
It can be seen in such minor details as the media&#039;s use of Oswald&#039;s middle name, as if employing it gave him more stature.
For example, the San Francisco Chronicle published a UPI report on 11/1/59 about Oswald&#039;s defection.
Having thus set his standards so high, one might have expected that Holland would have undertaken the few minutes of library work that would have been required to eliminate from Holland&#039;s text so obvious an error as this.
Although Holland has nowhere in print yet explored it, after my presentation at The Nation on the mysteries of the JFK medical/autopsy evidence, Holland said he believed it was likely that JFK&#039;s pathologists didn&#039;t dissect the back wound because of pressure from the Kennedys.
In a personal letter I responded that, although &#039;William Manchester,116 Gus Russo117 and John Lattimer, MD have advanced this notion,118 the weight of the evidence is against it.
So although there&#039;s no solid evidence for it, perhaps they did request that JFK&#039;s abdominal cavity, which houses the adrenals, be left alone, especially since JFK suffered no abdominal injuries.
But even if the Kennedys had made that seemingly reasonable request, it was ignored.
Russo recount that one of JFK&#039;s pathologists, Pierre Finck, MD, said that, &#039;The Kennedy family did not want us to examine the abdominal cavity, but the abdominal cavity was examined.
If Finck was right, so much for the military&#039;s kowtowing to the Kennedys.
Perhaps the only &#039;victory&#039; the family may have won was that the doctors kept quiet about JFK&#039;s adrenal problems, at least until 1992.
But they didn&#039;t win much else, and they didn&#039;t interfere with the autopsy.
They didn&#039;t, for example, select the sub par autopsists; military authorities did.
Realizing how over their heads they were, the nominees requested that nonmilitary forensic consultants be called in.
Moreover, Humes apparently confided in a personal friend &amp;ndash; CBS&#039;s Jim Snyder &amp;ndash; that, as Bob Richter put it in 1967 in a once-secret, internal, CBS memorandum, &#039;Humes also he had orders from someone he refused to disclose &amp;ndash; other than stating it was not Robert Kennedy &amp;ndash; to not do a complete autopsy.
And, finally, as an important, though not dispositive, legal matter, RFK left blank the space marked &#039;restrictions&#039; in the permit he signed authorizing his brother&#039;s autopsy.
Garrison As mentioned, Holland&#039;s latest and perhaps most ambitious theory involves a successful Communist conspiracy.
Namely, that via a false story planted in the Italian paper Paese Sera, the KGB had hoodwinked Jim Garrison into believing Clay Shaw had CIA ties, ties that in Garrison&#039;s febrile imagination also bound Shaw to Oswald, and both to Dallas.
The commie concoction left collateral damage extending far beyond doubts about Dallas.
As evidence of the KGB&#039;s chicanery Holland cites testimony from Richard Helms that proves &#039;Paese Sera&#039;s well-documented involvement in dezinformatsiya.
Holland writes that, &#039;Altogether, Helms observed, the episode was an &#039;excellent example of how the Communists use the false news story&#039; to stunning effect.
Six years later, a grander and more pernicious concoction originating in the same newspaper, Paese Sera, would go unexamined, unexposed, and unchallenged.
But nowhere in the 1967 Paese Sera series was there any mention of the Kennedy case.
Only that Shaw had been on the board of directors of an international trade organization headquartered in Rome, Centro Mondiale Comerciale , and that it had been a CIA front.
The fact that the first of Paese Sera&#039;s six articles appeared a scant three days after Shaw&#039;s arrest was taken as more damning evidence against the news outlet.
In an unusual departure from his custom of writing only book reviews, Foreign Affairs contributor Philip Zelikow wrote a favorable commentary on Holland&#039;s web-only piece.
They wrote a letter to Foreign Affairs&#039; editor, which the magazine refused to run.
Ironically, Stone and Sklar then published their snubbed letter as an advertisement in, of all places, The Nation,134 where Holland has served as a contributing editor.
It was a fascinating rebuttal to Holland&#039;s KGB conspiracy theory, which, they said, was based virtually entirely on a single handwritten note of a Russian defector that makes no mention of Clay Shaw, of CMC, or of Jim Garrison.
Moreover, they charged that Holland had published his story without having done as elemental a background check as contacting the editors of Paese Sera.
Had Holland bothered to do his homework, they said, Paesa Sera&#039;s editors, &#039;would have told him that the six-part series had nothing to do with the KGB or the JFK assassination, that they had never heard of Jim Garrison when they assigned the story six months before , and that they were astonished to see that Shaw might have any connection to the assassination.
He apparently correctly pointed out that Garrison had wrongly claimed in his book that he hadn&#039;t heard of the Paese Sera articles before he tried Clay Shaw in 1969.
Holland found notes from Life correspondent Richard Billings dated in March and April 1967 that suggested Garrison had gotten wind of Paese Sera&#039;s charges.
Though Holland was probably right that Garrison had heard of the charges from Italy in 1967, it is far from clear that he thought that much about them, that they were the &#039;wellspring for his ultimate theory&#039; of Agency involvement.
Former FBI agent turned FBI critic, William W Turner, a close confidant of Garrison in that era, told the author that Paese Sera in no way influenced Garrison&#039;s actions.
Second, you can&#039;t name a single action Garrison undertook that can be explained by those articles.
Since Garrison couldn&#039;t cite the stories in court, and since he couldn&#039;t afford to send investigators to Italy to prove the charges, they weren&#039;t useful legally.
On the Trail of the Assassins was first published in 1988, 21 years after Shaw&#039;s arrest.
Whether Garrison secretly burned with the rumors from Rome may never be known.
But it is clear that, other than perhaps to Billings, Garrison thereafter made scant mention of them and probably did forget about them by the time of the trial, two years later.
Nor did he mention Clay Shaw, although perhaps because of the pending legal wrangle.
In fact, Shaw had had an eight-year relationship with the CIA, sending the Agency information on 33 separate occasions that the CIA invariably graded as &#039;of value&#039; and &#039;reliable.
Holland never thought to question whether Helms&#039;s innocent version of its arrangement with Shaw was fully truthful, or whether the Agency files he has seen had been sanitized.
Responding to Holland&#039;s imaginative theory, William Turner published a letter in the May issue of New Orleans Magazine that offered additional insights on whether Garrison was duped.
I am a former FBI agent and author who assisted Garrison in his JFK assassination probe.
What Holland omits is that last April he contacted me about my calling Garrison&#039;s attention to Italian press reports on Shaw&#039;s link to CIA-influenced trade organizations.
I told him that the DA&#039;s office would not use press clippings as evidence, and that it should have been up to the FBI, which had the resources and the reach to investigate the alleged links.
What Holland overlooked is that on March 30, 1967, Betty Parrott, who was in the same social set as FBI agent Regis Kennedy, informed the DA&#039;s office that &#039;Kennedy confirmed to her the fact that Clay Shaw is a former CIA agent who did some work for the CIA in Italy over a five-year span.
In fact, Shaw was indicted by a grand jury, and a judge at a preliminary hearing ruled that there was probable cause to bring him to trial.
The jury found that Garrison proved a conspiracy but did not produce sufficient evidence to plug Shaw into it.
In 1978 the House Select Committee on Assassinations thought Garrison had the right man.
Besides Betty Parrott&#039;s pre-trial revelation, and Weisberg&#039;s book naming the CIA in 1967, Garrison had other reasons to link the CIA to the crime.
The Agency was then well known to have been responsible for the botched Bay of Pigs affair, and Garrison then knew that numerous Oswald associates had ties to that episode.
As Philip Melanson has noted, &#039;The shadowy figures who surrounded &amp;ndash; de Mohrenschildt, Ferrie, Banister, and some of the anti-Castro Cubans &amp;ndash; were CIA-connected.
One of the things we learned from the Iran-Contra affair is that in the clandestine world it is difficult to determine who is really working for the government, as opposed to those who pretend they are or who think they are.
Elements of the CIA&#039;s anti-Castro network could easily have conspired to assassinate the president, using Oswald as the centerpiece of the operation.
Holland&#039;s evidence for the paper&#039;s KGB pedigree is less than perfect.
For, as we have seen, it consists primarily of CIA man Richard Helms&#039;s 1961 Senate testimony about an April 23, 1961 Paese Sera&#039;s story.
It was the one Helms said had first connected the CIA to the &#039;generals&#039; coup against De Gaulle, a smear that grew as it was retold by other media outlets.
Thus, &#039;rumors&#039; weren&#039;t planted in Italy first; they were accurately reported in Italy first, by Paese Sera.
Tully added that, &#039;the evidence indicates there were CIA operatives who let their own politics show and by doing so led the rebels to believe that the United States looked with favor on their adventure.
Thus, Holland&#039;s working premise of &#039;Paese Sera&#039;s well-documented involvement in dezinformatsiya&#039; during the failed French coup is not exactly well-documented.
It is fair to wonder at Holland&#039;s embrace of Helms, a man of no small accomplishment in the art of spreading dezinformatsiya.
During the very 1961 Senate appearance discussing &#039;Communist Forgeries&#039; Holland cites, Helms displayed what he characterized as fabricated reports alleging an &#039;American Plot to Overthrow Sukarno.
Thus, at least in this instance, foreign dezinformatsiya was closer to the truth than the Senate testimony of a high CIA official.
In relying on Helms, Holland may be forgiven for not knowing the misleading nature of some of Helms testimony in 1961, but he surely could not have forgotten that Helms had lied to the United States Senate.
Helms told the Senate the CIA had played no role in demolishing Chile&#039;s democracy in 1973.
The first time Holland presented his KGB-duped-Garrison theory was apparently in an article entitled, &#039;The Demon in Jim Garrison,&#039; published in the spring 2001 issue of the Wilson Quarterly.
On 15 October 1999, McAdams started a thread in the &#039;alt.assassination.jfk&#039; on-line newsgroup entitled, &#039;IL PAESE SERA and Communist disinformation.
Although this fable could have been started by supporters of General Challe, it bears all the earmarks of having been invented within the bloc.
In Western Europe this lie was first printed on the 23rd of April by a Rome daily called Il Paese.
We believe it to be a crypto-Communist paper but it is not like Unit&amp;agrave;, the large Communist daily in Rome.
It purports to be an independent newspaper, but obviously it serves Communist ends.
This paper and its evening edition, Paese Sera, belong to a small group of journals published in the free world but used as outlets for disguised Soviet propaganda.
These newspapers consistently release and replay anti-American, anti-Western, pro-Soviet bloc stories, distorted or wholly false.
Mario Malloni, director of both Il Paese and Paese Sera, has been a member of the World Peace Council since 1958.
On the next day Pravda published in Moscow a long article about the generals&#039; revolt.
This is important context for understanding the PAESE SERA articles that linked Clay Shaw to CMC/Permindex, and connected CMC/Permindex to support for the OAS attempts against DeGaulle, various fascist and Nazi forces, etc.
The PAESE SERA stories were quickly picked up and repeated by leftist journals in France, Moscow, and Canada.
This by no means proves that the CMC/PERMINDEX stuff was a KGB disinformation operation.
The left-wing journalists at the paper would have been happy to smear what they considered to be the &quot;forces of capitalist imperialism&quot; without any direct orders from Moscow.
Indeed, Helms is only *inferring* that the earlier story about anti-De Gaulle generals was a KGB operation.
But this episode does put the 1967 articles on Shaw/Permindex into context.
The articles were, in one way or another, motivated by a communist ideological agenda.
Holland nowhere credits McAdams with his KGB/Pease Sera-duped-Garrison &#039;find.
As a &#039;functional representative&#039;156 of American elites, the deceitful and arrogant, and &#039;always hawkish,&#039; Kennedy was an enthusiastic manifestation of America&#039;s powerful militaristic inclinations.
He in no way represented a change in America&#039;s direction &amp;ndash; whether on Vietnam, on Cuba, or on the Cold War.
Kennedy&#039;s rabid anti-Castroism provoked an unstable Castroite to take his revenge.
After that, the family hobbled the government&#039;s no-holds-barred investigation to protect the daft myth of Camelot.
Furthermore, the Warren Commission&#039;s shortcomings, which Holland does not totally deny, were not the product of errors made in bad faith.
They were instead missteps that resulted from the honorable, if imperfect, efforts of government to protect vital state secrets during a particularly nasty stretch of the Cold War, all the while struggling against Kennedy family impediments in conducting as thorough an investigation as was humanly possible.
What is perhaps most surprising is how broad, divers and mainstream the new consensus is.
It turns out the public record now shows that JFK was clearly not &#039;always hawkish.
He withstood pressure from the CIA and the military to follow-up the foundering Bay of Pigs invasion with a military assault on Cuba.
He rejected advice to use force in Laos, pushing against the defense establishment to achieve an ultimately successful negotiated settlement.
He shouldered aside the defense and intelligence establishments to advance a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviets.
For example, in Harper&#039;s Magazine, Naval War College historian David Kaiser wrote that in his new book, American Tragedy, he had extensively documented that there were &#039; numerous occasions during 1961, 1962, and 1963 on which Kennedy did exactly that , rejecting the near unanimous proposals of his advisers to put large numbers of American combat troops in Laos, South Vietnam, or both.
A fresh look at the final months of his presidency suggests that a second Kennedy term might have produced not only an American withdrawal from Vietnam, but also rapprochement with Fidel Castro&#039;s Cuba.
So it may well be that the greatest irony of all is that in the mountain of documents released in response to the public uproar over the pro-Kennedy and pro-conspiracy film that Max Holland so abhors, the Bronze Star-winning, Vietnam veteran movie maker, Oliver Stone, has won again.
He did represent change &amp;ndash; right up until the moment the shots rang out in Dealey Plaza.

They inquired about the results, why the autopsy was consuming so much time, and the need for speed and efficiency, while still performing the required examinations.

The War Room &amp;ndash; What Robert Dallek&#039;s new biographs doesn&#039;t tell you about JFK and Vietnam.
This version has been updated and revised beyond what was originally published in this issue.The Nation Magazine has long been one of the most perceptive and eloquent voices for skepticism in publishing.
It has always been an early voice, often the first, to question official pronouncements – on Vietnam, on Watergate, on Iran-Contra, on Guatemala, on Haiti, and Chile.
In taking down the Warren Commission, malicious and stupid skeptics have spawned a corrosive public cynicism not only about the government's honest answer to the Crime of the Century in 1964, but also about government in general.Holland Face to FaceHere I must own up to some personal history with Max Holland.
Max Holland did not appear pleased at what he heard.Newman projected documents showing that Oswald had been impersonated in taped conversations recorded by the CIA in Mexico City six weeks before JFK's death.
During the nationally-broadcast Frontline documentary – 'Who was Lee Harvey Oswald?' – Commission lawyer W David Slawson admitted that he had been permitted to hear at least part of one tape during his tenure with the Commission.John Armstrong gave his usual dramatic presentation of documents showing that on numerous occasions there were two different 'Oswalds' appearing simultaneously in different locations.
But not from the target of Kennedy's malice, Castro, but instead from a delusional, self-appointed pro-Castro avenger.The government's well-intended decision to protect the public from the seamier aspects of this scenario explains why the public has never understood the whole picture.
Lacking even a valid scintilla with which to move forward against Shaw, the bogus story was all the loose cannon in New Orleans needed.
The final upshot was a senseless catastrophe for Shaw, and a loss of faith in America.Holland, it should be emphasized, does not deny that some cynicism about government is justified.
First, the public didn't 'adorn' the Roswell incident with paranoid mythic significance because the government told the truth but not the whole truth; it did so because the government invited farfetched theorizing by offering three different 'factual' explanations for what really happened there, at least two of which were lies.A more 'sophisticated understanding' doesn't lead one to trust the government more, as Holland would have it, but less.
And it doesn't reflect the changing nature of what properly constitutes 'paranoia' today.Since Hofstadter delivered his famous lecture in 1963, 'paranoia' has been beating a steady retreat.
I mean they went out in the field, they interviewed witnesses, they deposed witnesses, they conducted a first hand evaluation of evidence ... you can say weren't trained homicide investigators – that's true – but the FBI didn't also investigate a lot of murders either.
And if that wasn't adequate disproof of rumors Oswald had ties to the Bureau, Holland adds that, 'All the FBI agents who ever came into contact with Oswald signed affidavits saying they had never attempted to recruit Oswald.
It isn't surprising that such a novel defense has never been tried before by anyone – except, perhaps, by ex-Commissioners Gerald Ford and David Belin.Instead, skepticism about the Warren Commission has been the rule.
Those critiques, it should be noted, bear an eerie similarity to the critiques of skeptics such as historian Michael Kurtz, journalist Henry Hurt, Sylvia Meagher, Notre Dame law professor and former HSCA chief counsel, Robert Blakey, Peter Dale Scott, as well as many others.There is no denying that the Commission learned little about Oswald's associates.
Basing its conclusions on FBI-supplied 'character references' from, among others, two known mob associates ,40 the Commission ultimately concluded Ruby was not connected to the mob.Then in 1977, the HSCA performed the rudimentary task of actually analyzing Ruby's calls and exposing Lenny Patrick's and Dave Yaras' mob ties.
It made the obvious connection – one that fit other compelling, and previously ignored, evidence that tied Ruby to the Mafia, and the Mafia to the crime.
The evidence indicates that Hoover viewed the Warren Commission more as an adversary than a partner in a search for the facts of the assassination,' the HSCA concluded in 1978.44 Speaking for all the Commissioners in 1977, chief counsel J Lee Rankin admitted that in 1964, the Commissioners were naïve about Hoover's honesty and yet were afraid to confront him when he wouldn't properly fetch for them.
This had repercussions on possibly the most explosive rumor the Warren Commission ever dealt with – that Oswald had been an FBI informant.
The record also suggests the CIA had been little better than the FBI.Two years before the HSCA issued its report, the Senate Select Committee reported on its own examination of the process employed by both agencies.
That is, two government bodies that – armed in abundance with the one key capacity the Commission needed but lacked, a staff of experienced and proven criminal investigators – uncovered good reasons to incline any reasonable person toward skepticism.
For although they admitted doubting, and with good reason, the truthfulness of some of the witnesses, the Commissioners freely admitted they never once found even a single occasion to offer a grant of immunity to pursue their only client.The HSCA's chief counsel, Robert Blakey, an experienced criminal investigator and prosecutor himself, was impressed with neither the Commission's vigor nor its independence.
They have tried the case and reached a verdict on every aspect.Senator Hale Boggs: You have put your finger on it.
Complaining in The Nation that HSCA deputy chief counsel Gary Cornwell 'recycles some of the hoariest clichés regarding the Warren Commission ,'58 Holland seems disinclined to accept any of the HSCA's critique of the Commission.
Almost immediately after the assassination, Director Hoover, the Justice Department and the White House 'exerted pressure' on senior Bureau officials to ... issue a factual report supporting the conclusion that Oswald was the lone assassin.
Apparently Commissioner McCloy's word – 'We are so dependent on for our facts' – accounts for nothing with Max Holland.
From the record, author Howard Roffman has pointed to a clear inclination on the Commission's part that existed before it had begun its investigation.He has written:Now, Rankin and Warren drew up the plans for the organization of the work that the staff was to undertake for the Commission.
Thus, it is painfully apparent that the Commission did, from the very beginning, plan its work with a distinct bias.
This outline reveals in detail the extent to which the conclusion of Oswald's guilt was pre-determined.
Section II, ""Lee Harvey Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy,"" begins by outlining Oswald's movements on the day of the assassination.
Even the FBI had refrained from drawing a conclusion as to whether or not Oswald had murdered Officer Tippit.
Another heading under Section II of the outline is ""Evidence Identifying Oswald as the Assassin of President Kennedy,"" again a presumptive designation made by a commission that had not yet analyzed a single bit to evidence.With Earl Warren confident in the FBI's solution so early in the game, Warren critic Dwight McDonald made an insightful comment in 1965 on how the rest of the chips so easily fell into place.
Moreover, The Athens Observer also noted that Russell has never hidden his dissent.
Holland Redeems Nicholas KatzenbachIn a telling paragraph, Holland sought to salvage the sullied reputation of the Deputy Attorney General in 1963.
In his book Bay of Pigs – The Untold Story,90 Peter Wyden reminds us that JFK repeatedly made it clear he wanted no American men landing on the beaches during the Cuban invasion.
Instead, what may really be inconceivable is that anyone could look at the record and still believe that the CIA was the President's personal instrument, for good or ill, during the Cold War.Holland Examines The EvidenceSince neither Cockburn nor Holland is expert on the Kennedy assassination, they've relied upon others.
Perhaps unbeknownst to Holland is the fact that his favorite conspiracy exorcist has himself been debunked, not only by the skeptics,96979899100101 but also by no less than the legitimate authorities Posner reverently cites in his own book.
Even the recently disbanded panel of civilian historians hired by the government to declassify millions of once secret records – the JFK Review Board – took a whack at Posner in their final report, after Posner stonewalled two personal requests from the Board for information.5In the few instances in which he actually discusses specific evidence, Holland places too great a reliance on dubious sources and incautious speculation.
Thus if Holland and Posner are right that the little girl turned in reaction to a missed, first shot, the timing of her turn excuses Oswald.Thus Holland offers as evidence of Oswald's guilt the misinterpreted motions of this single person, while ignoring far more credible accounts of numerous other witnesses who place the first shot at circa Z-180-195.
He is also silent about the fact the HSCA concluded the first shot was fired circa 190.
Significantly, the search for meaning extended outside the immediate Kennedy family circle too.
Any decent public library would have sufficed.For example, the San Francisco Chronicle published a UPI report on 11/1/59 about Oswald's defection.
While this error is a rather minor one, it deserves attention given how Holland had placed himself above academics such as Scott, who he had castigated for unreliability.
A wild-eyed New Orleans district attorney off on a snipe hunt.But nowhere in the 1967 Paese Sera series was there any mention of the Kennedy case.
It was a fascinating rebuttal to Holland's KGB conspiracy theory, which, they said, was based virtually entirely on a single handwritten note of a Russian defector that makes no mention of Clay Shaw, of CMC, or of Jim Garrison.Moreover, they charged that Holland had published his story without having done as elemental a background check as contacting the editors of Paese Sera.
They also dismissed as nonsense Holland's claim that, 'the Paese Sera articles were what led Garrison to believe the CIA was involved in the assassination,' noting that, 'Garrison's book On the Trail of the Assassins describes in detail how his uncovering of various pieces of evidence actually led him to the conclusion that the CIA was involved.
But Holland fired right back with gusto, answering Stone and Sklar in the letters pages of the The Nation.
Though Holland was probably right that Garrison had heard of the charges from Italy in 1967, it is far from clear that he thought that much about them, that they were the 'wellspring for his ultimate theory' of Agency involvement.Former FBI agent turned FBI critic, William W Turner, a close confidant of Garrison in that era, told the author that Paese Sera in no way influenced Garrison's actions.
On the Trail of the Assassins was first published in 1988, 21 years after Shaw's arrest.7Whether Garrison secretly burned with the rumors from Rome may never be known.
Subpoenaed by Garrison, Kennedy refused to testify on grounds of executive privilege.Holland portrays the Shaw trial as a farce.
Looking Back at the FBI, the CIA and Other Tails.4Besides Betty Parrott's pre-trial revelation, and Weisberg's book naming the CIA in 1967, Garrison had other reasons to link the CIA to the crime.
Thus, Holland's working premise of 'Paese Sera's well-documented involvement in dezinformatsiya' during the failed French coup is not exactly well-documented.It is fair to wonder at Holland's embrace of Helms, a man of no small accomplishment in the art of spreading dezinformatsiya.
Thus, at least in this instance, foreign dezinformatsiya was closer to the truth than the Senate testimony of a high CIA official.In relying on Helms, Holland may be forgiven for not knowing the misleading nature of some of Helms testimony in 1961, but he surely could not have forgotten that Helms had lied to the United States Senate.
The PAESE SERA stories were quickly picked up and repeated by leftist journals in France, Moscow, and Canada.This by no means proves that the CMC/PERMINDEX stuff was a KGB disinformation operation.
The left-wing journalists at the paper would have been happy to smear what they considered to be the ""forces of capitalist imperialism"" without any direct orders from Moscow.
Indeed, Helms is only *inferring* that the earlier story about anti-De Gaulle generals was a KGB operation.But this episode does put the 1967 articles on Shaw/Permindex into context.
He in no way represented a change in America's direction – whether on Vietnam, on Cuba, or on the Cold War.
After that, the family hobbled the government's no-holds-barred investigation to protect the daft myth of Camelot.Furthermore, the Warren Commission's shortcomings, which Holland does not totally deny, were not the product of errors made in bad faith.
But it is close to the one we get from Oliver Stone.So it may well be that the greatest irony of all is that in the mountain of documents released in response to the public uproar over the pro-Kennedy and pro-conspiracy film that Max Holland so abhors, the Bronze Star-winning, Vietnam veteran movie maker, Oliver Stone, has won again.To The Establishment, JFK was a threat.
