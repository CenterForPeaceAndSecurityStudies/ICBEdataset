Only 13 days earlier, another U-2 detected Soviet ballistic missiles on the island, setting off alarm in Washington.After taking off from a base in Orlando, Florida and reaching an altitude of 72,000 feet , Anderson was tasked with using the U-2’s high-powered cameras to photograph Cuban and Soviet deployments near the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay.
He was also ordered to “probe” Soviet air defenses.The Soviets had set up 24 sites across Cuba with V-75 surface-to-air missiles, the same defenses that had brought down a U-2 plane flown by Francis Gary Powers over the Soviet Union in 1960.
Our guest has been up there for over an hour,” Grechko told his superior.
Three minutes later, two V-75 missiles slammed into the U-2 plane near Banes in the north of the island.
The plane strayed into Soviet air space, and six Soviet MiG-21 fighters were in pursuit, according to documents uncovered by Dobbs.Disturbed by the news, the president told his advisers the shootdown over Cuba was an apparent “escalation” by Moscow.His hawkish assistant defense secretary, Paul Nitze, called it an opening salvo.
He speculated whether his American counterpart would be able to “stomach the humiliation” of losing the aircraft.Although he had authorized commanders in Cuba to fight back in self-defense, Khrushchev never ordered attacks on unarmed reconnaissance planes.The two sides sensed they were approaching a point of no return.At 8:00 pm, Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, met with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.
