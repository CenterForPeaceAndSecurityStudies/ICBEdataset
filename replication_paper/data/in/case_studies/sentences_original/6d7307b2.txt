The Brink of War In Saving Jackie K, JFK’s Vice President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, laments the Commander-in-Chief’s missteps regarding the communist island nation of Cuba.
On October 14, 1962, a United States Air Force U-2 plane flying a reconnaissance mission over the Caribbean photographed alarming images of Soviet missile bases being constructed on Cuban soil.
The military intelligence turned an already adversarial relationship into an imminent threat of war.
Three months into his presidencyin April of 1961JFK had launched the Bay of Pigs invasion, an operation later deemed a fiasco by advocates and naysayers alike.
Kennedy sent in CIA-trained Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro‘s communist regime.
However, he failed to deliver promised Air Force support, and the exiles were defeated by Cuban armed forces.
A covert program involving propaganda, sabotage and psychological warfare to undermine the communist regime, the continuing operation was widely regarded as a policy failure of the United States government.
On October 28, Khrushchev announced his intention to dismantle and remove the missiles from Cuba.
The confrontation marked closest point in time that the Cold War escalated to the brink of nuclear conflict.
