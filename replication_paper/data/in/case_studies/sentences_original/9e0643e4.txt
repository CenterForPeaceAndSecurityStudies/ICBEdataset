President John F Kennedy imposed a United States naval blockade of Cuba after American spy planes found Soviet missile sites on the Communist-ruled island.
After a tense 13-day standoff between the United States and Soviet Union, the crisis ended peacefully on Oct. when the Soviets began to dismantle their missile sites.
Russia to Dismantle Cuba Missiles By Robert W Richards, Chief, The San Diego Union’s Washington Bureau, Copley News Service WASHINGTON — In a dramatic note to President Kennedy, Soviet PRemier Nikita Khrushchev announced yesterday that he had ordered the dismantling of Russian nuclear missiles in Cuba and their return to the Soviet Union.
President Kennedy replied with a pledge that there would be no air attack on the bases nor an invasion of Cuba, if this was accomplished.
Direct American military action had appeared imminent before the Khrushchev offer.
Khrushchev said he had ordered construction of the missile sites halted and the Soviet missiles in Cuba crated and shipped back to Russia.
United Nations SUPERVISION The Soviet premiere said the dismantling of the bases could be done under United Nations supervision.
Khrushchev agreed to all steps proposed by the President for a solution — or at least negotiations looking toward a solution — of the crisis.
In turn, the President described as “an important contribution to peace” Khrushchev’s decision.
Mr Kennedy also welcomed the Kremlin leader’s agreement that United Nations representatives should “verify” Soviet dismantling of the Cuban bases.
The president said such verification would mean that the United States blockade could be lifted.
