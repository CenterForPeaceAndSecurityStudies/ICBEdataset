For thirteen days, the fear of impending nuclear war continued until an agreement was reached for the removal of the weapons.
The Navy, in cooperation with the other United States armed forces and allies, strategically employed military power in such a way that the President did not have to resort to war to protect vital Western interests.
Khrushchev realized that his missile and bomber forces were no match for the Navy's powerful Polaris missile-firing submarines and the Air Force's land-based nuclear delivery systems once they became fully operational.
Naval forces under the United States Atlantic Command, headed by Admiral Robert L Dennison, steamed out to sea, intercepting both merchant shipping enroute to Cuba and Soviet submarines operating in the area.
United States destroyers and frigates, kept on station through underway replenishment by oilers and stores ships, maintained a month-long naval quarantine of the island.
Radar picket ships, supported by Navy fighters and airborne early warning planes, assisted the Air Force's Air Defense Command in preparing to defend American airspace from Soviet and Cuban forces.
As the unified commander for the Caribbean, Dennison was responsible for readying Army, Air Force, Marine, and Navy assault forces for a possible invasion of Cuba.
