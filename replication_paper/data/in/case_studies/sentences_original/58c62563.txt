The use of this moral analogy in the Cuban missile crisis is important in at least ªve respects.
Kennedy suggest that Robert Kennedy was the one who introduced the analogy into the discussion as part of an ethical argument against air strikes.
However, in comparison to the missile crisis, the “Pearl Harbor in reverse” argument generated little traction in 2003.
Morality in international relations is evident, for example, with widespread prohibitions on torture, colonialism, and unjust aggression.
The norm against surprise attacks featured to a remarkable extent in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, given the norm’s inherent ambiguity.
In other words, moral analogies provide the perception of ethical certainty in an uncertain moral world.
Third, references to Pearl Harbor served as a rhetorical tool to explain the administration’s policy to Congress and the American public.
He raised the possibility of creating a pretext for an invasion by “getting involved in this through Guantánamo Bay or something.
According to Theodore Sorensen, the moral analogy came up again later that day when former Secretary of State Dean Acheson was arguing for a military attack on Cuba without delay.
For many Americans, the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon seemed to parallel Pearl Harbor, notably the element of surprise and the intelligence failure.
The Kennedy tapes reveal that the Pearl Harbor moral analogy had a major causal impact during the ªrst week of the crisis.
The president acknowledged the military disadvantages of a warning, but by this point he was convinced that it was the best policy, and he never again seriously entertained a surprise attack.
On the other hand, if the analogy had not been invoked, the participants would probably not have drawn such a stark moral-political line between an air strike with a warning and one without.
