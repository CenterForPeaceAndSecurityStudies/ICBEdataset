A further consequence of the Cuban missile crisis was the removal of Khrushchev in October 1964.
Before the dismissal of Khrushchev and the death of Kennedy, there was a thaw in international relations.
In October 1962, the Kennedy Administration faced its most serious foreign policy crisis.
Air Force General Curtis LeMay was less sanguine because the United States had already been limiting its above ground tests while the Soviets had been increasing their own.

Now they were more prepared to take steps to reduce the risk of nuclear war.
Most historians agree that it was precisely because the consequences would have been so terrible, that a nuclear war was avoided.
They both had time to think about the terrible results of making the wrong move.
The main effect of this crisis was to scare both sides into being more cautious.
In October 1962, the Soviet provision of ballistic missiles to Cuba led to the most dangerous Cold War confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.
The Cuban missile crisis was a success for containment because America managed to get the nuclear missiles off of Cuba.
This is a success because the USA got the USSR to take the nuclear weapons off of Cuba and secretly took their missiles off of Turkey.
Thus, the Soviet did not remove missiles from Cuba because they were willing to do so.
Instead, they had no other option other than escaping from the United States that was provoked by these missiles.
It began when the Soviet Union began building missile sites in Cuba in 1962.
Kennedy notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact a naval blockade around Cuba and made it clear the United States was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security.
