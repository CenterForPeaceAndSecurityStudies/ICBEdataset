Baby' by Bruce Channel, 'The Four Seasons', 'Big Girls Don't Cry', and Ray Charles' 'Can't Stop Loving You' along with popular TV shows like 'The Dick Van Dyke Show', 'The Danny Thomas Show', and 'The Andy Griffith Show' also gave us the best pop culture history.
And then of course we had sad news too, like the death of Marilyn Monroe, who was assumed to have overdosed.
Marilyn Monroe was a famous and scandalous actress and fashion icon of the '50s.
Amidst all the good things, we even had the ongoing Cold War between the USA and the Soviet Union.
Post Second World War, everyone sensed that the world was divided into two ideologies; capitalism and communism, led by the USA and the Soviet Union, respectively.
There was a growing geopolitical tension and competition being sensed by everyone.
Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Premier, saw an imminent threat after the realization that the United States could overthrow Fidel Castro, the Cuban Prime Minister, anytime, and capture the small Soviet ally country, Cuba.
Cuba was a Soviet country located near the US, naturally posing the threat of being captured by them.
Additionally, Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin under the umbrella of the Soviet government.
So, by strategically placing the missiles, he planned on trying to negotiate with Western powers to take over Berlin.
Soviet missiles were a result of the arms race that both the United States and Soviet governments were actively taking part in, after the end of the World War.
President John F Kennedy, on the realization of the nuclear war threat, sent out a public warning against the introduction of nuclear weapons in Cuba.
Despite warnings, a United States U-2 aircraft, on October 14, clicked images of ballistic weapons in Cuba.
President Kennedy sent out another notice publicly to take any such weapon away from Cuba.
President Kennedy was stern in his voice and made clear that anything against the warning might lead to issues that are uncalled for.
Nikita Khrushchev replied to Kennedy that all Soviet missiles will surely be removed from Cuba upon an agreement of some kind that will promise that there will no longer be any threats upon Cuba in the future.
Nikita Khrushchev in his second letter suggested that any proposed deal must include the agreement of the United States to remove their missiles from Turkey.
Attorney General Robert Kennedy then met with the Soviet Ambassador to the USA and showed the indication that the United States was anyway planning to remove the missiles from Turkey.
Following that, on October 28, Khrushchev issued a public announcement that the Cuban missiles will be dismantled and removed.
However, even though the missiles were removed, the naval quarantine was still not lifted.
President Kennedy conveyed that the quarantine will not be removed unless the Soviet Union removed their IL-28 bombers from Cuba.
Spacewar!', developed by Steve Russell in collaboration with Bob Saunders, Steve Piner, Wayne WIitanen, Martin Graetz, and a few others, is a space combat video game that was developed in 1962.
It was written at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the newly installed DEC PDP-1 minicomputer making it the first computer video game ever.
They were PDP-1 which was priced at $120,000, weighing 1.609.37 lb and with a memory of just 4,000 words.
Imagine a board of advertising team thinking of a marketing strategy to get people to use this machine that weighed twice the refrigerator.
The developers of the game borrowed the orbital mechanic from Marvin Minsky's Minskytron which was a non-interactive demo for geometric interactions.
They also borrowed the star background from Samson's 'Expensive Planetarium' software.
Everything was ready to go into the game but what was the real challenge was the system to respond to the players because of the limited processor power.
Since the power to apply gravity to the ships' projectile weapons was limited, the MIT team decided to make photon torpedoes that were unaffected by gravity.The first version of the game allowed just two players and the lowest graphics possible.
However, by mid-1962, Samson came out with a second version of the game that had explosion graphics and scoring.
Since back then most of the players only included programmers, they quickly got the hang of it and started working on newer versions.
The fashion statement of the decade started out with the domination of high fashion with a gradual transformation into hippie fashion by the end of the decade.
The period of 1962 to the '70s was considered crucial with the entry of street style fashion that challenged the high-end and well-dressed fashion style.
Fashion icons like Audrey Hepburn, Twiggy, and the winners of the Miss USA beauty pageant played a great role in this transformation.
Audrey Hepburn was a leading lady in the film industry and proved that she can flawlessly pull off any outfit or style.
During the early years of the '60s, Hepburn's style was extremely feminine and lady-like.
This dress was designed by the legendary fashion designer Givenchy, also a close friend of Audrey Hepburn.
Givenchy and Hepburn have worked on many trends together to bring out the most trendy styles that could be copied by every woman for everyday life, making them the most influential style icons of the time.This change was not limited to just women's wear, unlike previous decades.
Men's fashion had striking transformations as well, especially due to the fact that menswear hasn't changed much for the past few years.
Men were leaning towards a more casual look as well and suddenly men were seen in colorful and vibrant suits.
Menswear gradually started incorporating colors and patterns with wider ties as the decade kept progressing.
Along with the transitioning styles, the style icons also started changing, and gradually icons like the members of The Beatles, Mick Jagger, and Jimi Hendrix started influencing bold and daring colors and patterns.
During the mid-60s, men's fashion trends were inspired by military elements.
Rock culture was one of the main fashion influences that introduced most of the new trends in the world of men's fashion.
Famous styles like tie-dye and loose-fitting shirts were introduced towards the end of the decade as the fashion industry moved on to a hippie vibe.Grocery Prices In The Year 1962The '60s were also known for those good ol' days that were not hit by inflation, unlike today's times.The '60s are known to be the years you would want to go back to if asked.
With legendary music, art, and pop culture, the '60s really hit hard on the emotional and nostalgic side.
But now imagine if you were in the '60s, all you would have to pay is a buck and enjoy yourself a great double-decker burger meal.
In many restaurants, in fact, you could also score a dessert along with the entire meal and all you will still be spending is just a dollar.
And if you care to spend a few more cents, you could also fancy yourself with a full chicken or shrimp dinner along with sides.
A pie would cost you around 35 cents a slice, the same price as that of an issue of Life Magazine, and could easily be savored on an ice-cream sundae for just 40 cents.
Although the fight was among the superpowers, the one that went through the most was poor Cuba.
Cuba found itself in the midst of a situation where all it could do was value the superpower's support.
The Cubans were happily ready to allow the installation of nuclear weapons in Cuba, but Khrushchev's insistence on their secret installation alarmed them.
They believed such arrangements should always be brought under public knowledge.However, Khrushchev thought of it differently and wanted to rather be on the safe side by keeping it a secret.
According to Khrushchev, it was an attempt to save Cuba from any future United States attacks.
When Khrushchev's lie was finally detected, through a United States spy aircraft, against the clear warnings against it by President Kennedy, an almost month-long conflict accompanied by letters back and forth followed and finally convinced Khrushchev to withdraw the weapons.
Although the presence of these weapons turned out to pose more threat on Cuba, when removed, Cuba was left feeling helpless, powerless and deceived and decided to never again trust the Soviet leader.
On the bright side, however, the Cubans did win a small battle and benefited in a sense through the formation of an agreement where all the threats that it was previously worried about from the US, were no longer an issue.
Although the name suggests it originates from Hawaii, it actually was created in Canada by a Greek immigrant named Sam Panopoulos who, along with his brothers, owned a restaurant in Ontario.62 was also the birth year of many legendary stars like Tom Cruise, Ralph Fiennes, Jim Carrey, Demi Moore, and many more.The famous book by Rachel Carson titled ""Silent Spring"" released in 1962.
Even to this day, ""Silent Spring"" remains relevant in the context of how humans affect the environment.The year 1962 also witnessed John Glenn taking a trip to space.
John Glenn was the first American who successfully orbited Earth, circling it three times.In international politics, the United Kingdom passed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1962.
