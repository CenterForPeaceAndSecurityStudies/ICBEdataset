It took over 13 years for the Air Force to respond to the National Security Archive’s FOIA request for this document; even then, the Air Force took another five years to complete its response, early in 2008, to the Archive’s appeal.
This document gives a full and fine-grained account of SAC’s complex role in the crisis, beginning with intelligence operations.
SAC’s 4080th Wing flew over 90 U-2 missions over Cuba during October 1962, including the well-known photographic intelligence flights, but also more secretive electronic intelligence missions flown on behalf of the National Security Agency.
Some details of the ELINT operations remain classified, but SAC U-2s began flying near Cuba months before the October crisis.
This history includes a brief account of the shoot-down by Soviet surface-to-air missiles of the U-2 flown by Major Rudolf Anderson on October 27 1962.
Although the U-2 flight that strayed into Soviet territory had significant implications for the crisis, this history does not cover that episode.
Besides the U-2 flights this history shows how SAC aircraft helped support the blockade of Cuba by searching for Soviet ships in the Atlantic.
Within hours of President Kennedy’s October 22 speech, SAC forces were on a DEFCON 2 posture, the highest level of United States force readiness short of a decision to go to war.
While most of the bombers were on ground alert, 65 nuclear-armed bombers were in the air at any given moment.
At the time of the missile crisis, the ICBM force mainly comprised liquid-fueled Atlas and Titan missiles.
The solid-fueled Minutemen ICBMs were in the earliest stages of deployment, and only a handful was available; contractors had to remain at the Minuteman sites to prevent any degradation of the alert.
