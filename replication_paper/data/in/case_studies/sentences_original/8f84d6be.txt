In sign of a reinvigorated alliance between the two former allies, the Kremlin announced on Tuesday that Cuban President Raul Castro will visit Russia in 2009.
Castros Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, called the visit another contribution to the development of ties between Cuba and Russia.
Although Russias alliance with its former client state waxed and waned during the Cold War, Russia and Cuba recently have forged renewed ties through economic deals and military agreements.
These partnerships include a proposed satellite launch facility in Cuba; Russias extension of state credit; a rumored refueling base for nuclear capable bombers; and accords covering the automobile, nickel and oil industries.
In addition, Russia was the first country to send emergency aid to Cuba in the wake of Hurricane Gustav earlier this year.
The new Russo-Cuban relationship has little to do with the mutual regard or ideological agreement that prevailed in the past.
It is instead a reflection both nations' shared antagonism toward the United States.
Cuba has been under a United States economic embargo since Fidel Castros Communist revolution turned the island nation from an ally to an enemy in 1962.
The new U.S.-Polish missile defense system agreement, for example, is viewed by the Kremlin as a threat, notwithstanding United States assurances that the system is defensive in nature.
Russia also is displeased by the Bush administrations condemnation of its invasion of Georgia earlier this year.
So far, most of the expenditures have been borne by Russia, money that the country can ill-afford to spend.
Finance minister Alexei Kudrin told parliament on November 12 that Russia may dip into its rainy day fund to supplement next years budget, with more economic support measures to be announced later in the week.
According to the Russian online daily Kommersant, Cuban negotiations with Russian oil giant LUKOIL to modernize two of its oil refineries never proceeded beyond the very initial stages.
As military analysts at Stratfor put it, Cuba is the perfect location to remind Washington that it, too, has a sensitive periphery.
If the Kremlin ever feels that the United States is pushing too hard on Russias core periphery, such as in Georgia or Ukraine, Moscow can ratchet up pressure in the Caribbean through military, overt and covert means.
Russian journalist Alexander Gabuev has speculated that president-elect Barack Obama could be seen as a threat to Russias position on the Latin American market.
He points out that a decision to lift the longstanding economic embargo absent political reform in Cuba could be interpreted as American weakness.
Instead of legitimizing the Cuban regime, he believes, the United States must press for a democratic transition in Cuba.

Biden predicts Obama will have to make some unpopular decisions in his first six months in office.
SEATTLE  Joe Biden told Democratic fundraisers Sunday night that there is no doubt in his mind a crisis will occur during Barack Obama's first six months in office that will test his mettle and force him to make unpopular decisions.
It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy,"" said Biden to a roomful of donors.
July 23, 2008 The media has been abuzz today at the prospect of Russian nuclear bombers being stationed in Cuba if the United States goes ahead with plans for missile defense bases in Eastern Europe.
The story broke earlier this week, when Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted an un-named source from within the Russian military.
He told the Russian daily:While they are deploying the missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, our strategic bombers will already be landing in Cuba.
Fighter jets swooped overhead, commandos jumped from helicopters on to rooftops and the boom of artillery shells shook the firing range in Russia's Ural mountains as two of the largest armies in the world were put through their paces.
The exercises take place against a backdrop of mounting rivalry between the West, and Russia and China for influence over Central Asia, a strategic region that has huge oil, gas and mineral resources.
The Cubans will only take part if they are provided a Russian teat to suckle from.
The Russians can't afford to put enough military hardware into Cuba to protect themselves, let alone hold the offensive.
Having Russian aircraft flying our coastline would remind the American people that we really do have something to worry about.
Additionally, it would give us the opportunity to send the Russians a strong military message if need be without hitting the Russian homeland.
They are also bound to work Venezuela into the mix, which will help solidify more of South and Central America against them.

SJackson; All Obama Pledges Cuts in Missile Defense, Space, and Nuclear Weapons Programs February 29, 2008 :: News MissileThreat.com A video has surfaced of Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama talking on his plans for strategic issues such as nuclear weapons and missile defense.
Thanks so much for the Caucus4Priorities, for the great work you've been doing.
As president, I will end misguided defense policies and stand with Caucus4Priorities in fighting special interests in Washington.
I will cut investments in unproven missile defense systems.I will not weaponize space.I will slow our development of future combat systems.
And I will institute an independent ""Defense Priorities Board"" to ensure that the Quadrennial Defense Review is not used to justify unnecessary spending.
To seek that goal, I will not develop new nuclear weapons; I will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material; and I will negotiate with Russia to take our ICBMs off hair-trigger alert, and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenals.
I've fought for open, ethical and accountable government my entire public life.
I don't posture on defense policy and I don't take money from federal lobbyists for powerful defense contractors.
As president, my sole priority for defense spending will be protecting the American people.
YouTube has an undated 52-second clip of Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barrack Obama outlining his plans for Americas national defense.
Obamas presentation demonstrates either total naivete about important national security programs or he is just pandering for votes among the extreme left.
Watch Obamas message and consider some inconvenient facts about his national security promises.
Yet, our military leaders make clear that the consequences of a rapid withdrawal from Iraq as Obama seeks would be disastrous not only for American interests in the region but for Iraq itself.
It would provide a propaganda victory for al Qaeda and Iran because they will be able to claim they defeated America.
Further, it could worsen the Iraqi civil war, create an unstable Mideast and further spike oil prices.
Recently, the Government Accountability Office found that 95 major weapons systems -including the Joint Strike Fighter and the Littoral Combat Ship -have exceeded their original budgets.
These cost overruns could be the result of waste or mismanagement or, perhaps, the development and fielding of sophisticated new weapons with constantly changing requirements is difficult and inefficient.
The senator should understand there is a difference between waste and defense spending.
There is no reason to think so in any of his speeches or position papers.
Obamas employer, the United States Congress, indulges in pork barrel earmarks contributing to wasteful Pentagon spending.
Earmarks circumvent merit-based systems to create jobs in favored congressional districts and saddle the military with unwanted -wasteful -programs.
In September, 2007, our ground-based midcourse defense system killed a dummy missile over the Pacific using an interceptor stationed in Alaska.
The United States Bureau of Arms Control warns, The ballistic missile danger to the US, its forces deployed abroad, and allies and friends is real and growing.
However, its important for policy makers to recognize the USs dependence on space.
Our banking, communications and navigation systems almost entirely depend on satellites.
Space lines of communication are as essential for commerce today as sea lines of communication were two centuries ago.
Surrendering space to rogue nations and pirates places our economy and military at risk.
Our air force is flying aircraft which are based on 1940s and 1950s technology and our army is driving 1960s and 1970s vintage vehicles.
Older equipment is expensive, time consuming to maintain and potentially dangerous.
The Armys Future Combat Systems is the first full-spectrum modernization effort in nearly 40 years.
It will replace Cold War-era relics with full-spectrum operations capable modular systems designed to operate in complex terrain.
Failing to develop future combat systems puts American warriors at risk and unnecessarily jeopardizes our security.
It lauded the Bush administration for sustained involvement of senior officials, extensive collaboration with interagency partners and creating a database to track implementation of initiatives.
The GAO faulted Congress for failing to clarify its expectations regarding what budget information the Pentagon should provide.
To make matters worse, Congress 2008 Defense Authorization Act created two new and redundant every four year analyses.
One is an independent military assessment of roles and missions and the other identifies core mission areas, competenceis and capabilities.
Obama is right to criticize the QDR because it has become an exercise in fantasy but his Congressional colleagues keep piling on new requirements.
The senator can help the Pentagon by scaling back on the analyses requirements.
Just tell the military what the country can afford and then have the services explain what they will buy and how much risk we will have to accept.
According to the head of the militarys Strategic Command, Air Force Gen.
Kevin Chilton, our warheads are aging and werent designed to last forever, making him nervous.
Ambassador Linton F Brooks, administrator of the USs National Nuclear Security Administration, said we have a new program that will potentially reduce the number of warheads and make them safer.
Its called the Reliable Replacement Warhead program and contemplates designing new components for previously tested nuclear packages.
Many of these same nations produce fissile material to fuel their nuclear power plants which light millions of homes and are a cheap, clean energy source in a world concerned about hydrocarbon pollution.
Efforts to control the production of fissile material date back to the 1946 Baruch Plan but that attempt was abandoned during the Cold War.
Bush announced that the United States no longer produced fissile material for nuclear weapons and in 1993 President Bill Clinton called for Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty negotiations.
While this is a worthy goal it is not achievable in an energy hungry world.
Only a portion of Americas deployed nuclear forces maintain a ready alert status.
Rather, our forces are postured to provide flexibility by raising the readiness status of the force and by putting weapons systems on alert when necessary.
However, we are making progress via the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty which proposes a reduction of the overall threathold of up to 1,500 warheads.
Russia has approximately 4,162 and the United States has 5,866 strategic warheads and both nations possess thousands of tactical weapons and reserve stocks as well.
Senator Obamas national security views expressed in his 52-second video reflect that of a knee-jerk liberal academic who thinks that the United States is the primary threat to world peace.
His views are dangerously naive and his statements suggest a shallow understanding of national security issues and in some cases his facts are wrong.
Mr Maginnis is a retired Army lieutenant colonel, a national security and foreign affairs analyst for radio and television and a senior strategist with the United States Army.
Get your missile shields out of eastern Europe, and we’ll remove our bombers from Venezuela and Cuba.
Its like get your Radar out of Turkey and we’ll remove our missiles from Cuba.
I notice that this “Change” is bringing in all the old has beens from the Clinton era.
