The crisis was defused, and the missiles left Cuba as the quarantine was lifted in November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roots of the crisis lay in the superpowers\u0026#8217; contest over Berlin that had come to a head the previous year.
In making his communist allegiances known in early 1962, Castro also indicated to the Soviet Union that, should it lack enthusiasm for communist expansionism in Latin America, he would court Chairman Mao\u0026#8217;s communist China as an alternative partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhrushchev decided he would submit to Castro\u0026#8217;s pressure and make Cuba the vehicle for the geopolitical victory he sorely desired after the 1961 developments in Berlin.
In the summer of 1962, therefore, the Soviet Union increased its exports of important military materiel to Cuba, depriving formerly favored allies such as Gamel Abdel Nasser\u0026#8217;s Egypt in the process.
The shipments included nuclear missile components that, when readied, could easily reach the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhrushchev understood that in the near future, the United States would detect these developments, but he accepted the risk that a crisis would ensue.
In his presidential campaign of 1960, Kennedy had bemoaned a \u0026#8220;missile gap\u0026#8221; between the United States and the Soviet Union, even though he knew the balance of these weapons actually favored the United States.
By having missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev hoped to discredit Kennedy by showing that not only was the missile gap real but also that it had become more extreme under Kennedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhrushchev\u0026#8217;s decision was exceedingly dangerous and risky.
It was \u0026#8220;one hell of a gamble,\u0026#8221; as Kennedy observed during the crisis that October.
However, the United States government did not regard the two situations as comparable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 16, Kennedy received word from his national security staff that aerial photography definitively showed Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, with launch sites being readied.
Ultimately, Kennedy chose the blockade but adjusted it to a \u0026#8220;quarantine.\u0026#8221; This meant that American naval vessels would only permit goods to pass into Cuba that were not associated with war materiel.
Soviet responses to Kennedy\u0026#8217;s moves were not conciliatory, and with large military forces of both superpowers gathered in and around Cuba, the world sensed that nuclear war could be imminent.
The United States Navy was stopping and boarding ships, a United States reconnaissance pilot was shot down , and at least one Soviet submarine with nuclear weapons was harassed by American forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn October 26, Kennedy received an otherwise-standoffish letter from Khrushchev that appeared to offer notes of conciliation and compromise.
The United States confirmed that it would end the blockade when the missiles and their attending apparatus were gone , as well as pledging not to invade Castro\u0026#8217;s island.
A unanimous vote among its three top officers was required to launch the sub\u0026#8217;s nuclear weapons.
Arkhipov refused to assent without receiving orders from Moscow, an action that likely saved the world from nuclear holocaust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy provoking the missile crisis, Khrushchev had secured an ally in Cuba, but it was an ally that had pushed him around to pursue its own goals.
He also did not secure the prize \u0026#8211; West Berlin \u0026#8211; that had motivated him to act in the first place.
He immortalized his success in a 1963 speech in that city in which he famously said, \u0026#8220;Ich bin ein Berliner\u0026#8221; and urged that if people wished to compare Communism and the free world, \u0026#8220;let them come to Berlin.\u0026#8221; The missile crisis also introduced a new sober realism to U.S.-Soviet relations.
