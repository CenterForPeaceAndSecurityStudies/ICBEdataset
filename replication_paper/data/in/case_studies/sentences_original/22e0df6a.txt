Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the Brink of… by Michael DobbsOther authors: See the other authors section.Series: Cold War Trilogy MembersReviewsPopularityAverage ratingMentions6631728,054 10""In October 1962, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union appeared to be sliding inexorably toward a nuclear conflict over the placement of missiles in Cuba.
The stories in the book that show how much the USA and the USSR misunderstood each other were very enlightening...you can't help but wonder if that is still the case today with international relations.
Jeff.Rosendahl | Sep 21, 2021 | This book came highly recommended, and it delivered a well written perspective on the Cuban crisis.I felt a little disconnected from the book being separated from the situation by gaps in geography, nationality and generation.Born in the 70's is it wrong to say ""I wish this book had more pictures in it?""...yeah.
So many things could have gone wrong, so many things beyond control from JFK or Khrusjtjov, so many close calls, so many series of events having their own life and momentum.
The way USAF planes with atomic weapons was dispersed throughout USA on airfields utterly unsuitable for the task.
Atomic weapons that could be launched by individuals, not needing a second person or code to confirm.
I know, a story has many facets and this is my first and so far â only book on the subject.
And one book may not be enough to get the true picture, if there is a true picture.
I was born in August 1962 and I could have lived my life in an atomic winther, if my family had survived.Read the book and draw your own conclusions.
Mr Dobbs writes in a very readable manner and the book is highly recommendable.
His main thesis is that there was no ""eyeball to eyeball and the Soviets blinked"", that was propaganda by the Kennedy team.
Rather he shows that both sides came closer to war than they realized, were in less control of events then they thought.
It's a great lesson of history and instructive about the complexity of events.
It leads to the pessimistic conclusion that an accidental nuclear detonation or war was very possible.
