As then ambassador to the UN, he brings frightening perspectives to the provocations between the Soviets and United States as they escalated beyond Cuban influence.
United States missiles siloed in Turkey prompted Soviet premier Khrushchev to even the playing field by establishing a continental nuclear threat in the Western Hemisphere.
For his part, Castro accepted Soviet missiles to reduce the risk of another American invasion after the Bay of Pigs fiasco a year before.
