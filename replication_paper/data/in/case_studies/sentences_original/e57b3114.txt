Corbis \\* **1962:** President Kennedy goes on television and informs the world that the Soviet Union has placed missile installations in Cuba, only 90 miles from the American mainland.\n\n+++\n\nIf the world, and especially the American public, was shocked by the revelation, the Kennedy administration was not.
The president had known about since at least Oct. and received final confirmation on Oct., when a United States U-2 spy plane returned high-altitude photographs clearly showing the presence of at least 15 Soviet surface-to-air missile launchers.\n\nThere were also unconfirmed reports of SS-3 and SS-4 missiles on an airfield outside of Havana, which, if true, put most of the eastern seaboard and southern United States within range of Soviet nuclear warheads.
Russian military personnel and technicians were also known to be on the island.\n\nSo there was the real threat of nuclear holocaust.
But there was also the audacity of the Russian move, which completely disregarded the Monroe Doctrine with its political justification for American hegemony in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Russian perspective was somewhat different.
With the invasion still fresh in his mind, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev feared another United States attempt to overthrow his ally Fidel Castro, so the missiles were meant as much as a deterrent as a threat.
The Russians were also unhappy about the United States putting their missiles right next door in Turkey, so this represented a quid pro quo.\n\nOnce the cat was out of the bag, Kennedy reacted swiftly.
His image has been softened over time by the Camelot mythology but make no mistake -Kennedy was no dove.
By the time he went on TV with the news, he was resolved to go to the mat with Khrushchev.\n\nWashington informed the Kremlin that any attack launched against the United States from Cuban soil would be regarded as an attack by the Soviet Union itself, with the resulting consequences.
Kennedy also ordered a naval blockade of Cuba, posing a direct challenge to the Soviet freighters still in the process of delivering their military hardware.\n\nThe Cold War was suddenly getting very hot.
On Oct., Kennedy raised military readiness to , one step removed from a total war footing.
It is generally accepted that the Cuban missile crisis was the closest the world has come to an all-out nuclear war.\n\nIn the end, Khrushchev blinked first.
Realizing he'd overstepped himself, he sent a letter to Kennedy offering to withdraw the missiles in exchange for American guarantees not to invade Cuba.
A second letter -saying that the Russians would pull their missiles from Cuba if the United States removed its missiles from Turkey -was ignored by Washington.
