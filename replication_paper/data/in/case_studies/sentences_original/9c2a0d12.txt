Associated Press.MIAMI — Fidel Castro, who led a rebel army to improbable victory, embraced Soviet-style communism, and defied the power of 10 United States presidents during his half-century rule of Cuba, has died at age 90.
With a shaking voice, President Raul Castro said on state television that his older brother died at 10:29m. on Friday.
The bearded revolutionary, who survived a crippling United States trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died 10 years after ill health forced him to hand power over to Raul.
Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico, and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America.
Carlos Rodriguez, 15, was sitting in Havana's Miramar neighbourhood when he heard that Fidel Castro had died.
But the news cheered the community of Cuban exiles in Florida who had fled Castro's government.
Thousands gathered in the streets in Miami's Little Havana to cheer and wave Cuban flags.
Freed under a pardon, Castro fled to Mexico and organised a rebel band that returned in 1956, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba on a yacht named Granma.
The United States was among the first to formally recognise his government, cautiously trusting Castro's early assurances he merely wanted to restore democracy, not install socialism.
Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castro's daughter, Alina Fernández Revuelta, and his younger sister, Juana.
Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev removed them.
In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Díaz-Canel as his successor.
Cuba's government announced that Castro's ashes would be interred on the 4th of December in the eastern city of Santiago that was a birthplace of his revolution.
That will follow more than a week of honours, including a nearly nationwide caravan retracing, in reverse, his tour from Santiago to Havana with the triumph of the revolution in 1959.
