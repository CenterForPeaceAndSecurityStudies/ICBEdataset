It was essentially an illegal attempt which was encouraged and funded by the CIA/Cuban Exiles to invade Cuba.
The Americans felt it necessary to invade when Fidel Castro came to rule, turned his country into a communist nation and nationalized all American companies.
This process of nationalization ensured that Cuba gained the benefits from privately owned American companies.The Americans failed miserably, and as a result of this attack Cuba felt they needed more protection.
Therefore they asked the Soviet Union for weapons to defend Cuba against America.
If the ‘Bay of Pigs’ invasion hadn’t failed or furthermore ever been attempted, Cuba would not have the nuclear missiles they were threatening America with throughout the entire missile crisis.
However, it was not only the Bay of Pigs invasion that made the leaders of Cuba nervous.
This military exercise and the failed ‘Bay of Pigs’ invasion were all an attempt to keep Fidel Castro very nervous.
As a result of these attacks Castro was completely convinced that the U.S were serious about launching an attack on Cuba and therefore went to the Soviet Union for military protection.
Therefore any Soviet/Latin alliance was viewed by the Americans as a direct threat to their safety and protection.
