On four separate occasions in 1960 and early &apos;61, war scares shook the island.
During one of these, in October, 1960, Cuba mobilized thousands of soldiers to combat an imminent U.S.-backed landing.
Despite a lack of evidence, the Soviets, who were then wooing Cuba, accepted the idea of a looming invasion, too.<\/p>\n <p>But no attack materialized.
Elated, Fidel Castro and his inner circle believed that Soviet threats of retaliation had caused the United States to back down.
In fact, neither the KGB nor the Cuban security forces knew much at all about United States plans.
So when the true invasion came, on Apr. at Playa de Giron, the small Cuban garrison there was taken completely by surprise.
But President John F Kennedy&apos;s ambivalence about the operation and the fatal lack of air support for the Cuban-exile invaders allowed the Castroites to triumph.
The book is a trove of fresh information, partly gleaned from newly accessible Soviet archives--including Premier Nikita Khrushchev&apos;s office files--and partly from interviews with surviving players.
In October, high-altitude United States reconnaissance flights revealed the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba.
In ensuing United States National Security Council meetings, participants debated a United States response ranging from air strikes to blockades to outright invasion.
Kennedy opted for a Navy-enforced &quot;strict quarantine&quot; of Cuba--announced in a dramatic speech on national television.
But Khrushchev refused to call back ships steaming toward the island with additional nukes aboard.
Castro mobilized 350,000 soldiers, and the United States Strategic Air Command was placed on nuclear alert.
The Soviets would remove the missiles; Kennedy would end the quarantine and pledge not to invade Cuba.
Moreover, from the earliest days of the revolutionary regime, Raul was working to engineer closer ties to the Soviet Union.<\/p>\n <p>We also learn that during the missile crisis, the world came very close to holocaust indeed.
For at one point, the Kremlin signed orders allowing the Soviet commander in Cuba to use tactical missiles in the event of a United States invasion.
Following the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he settled for covert action against Cuba since every other approach seemed problematic.
It would, Khrushchev believed, &quot;answer the American threat but...also avoid war,&quot; since he expected Kennedy simply to swallow a fait accompli.<\/p>\n <p>The book offers fly-on-the-wall excitement.
At times, the source material seems to be writing the book, as the authors fail to counter their documents&apos; biases and flaws.
For example, Kennedy Administration materials portray outgoing President Dwight D Eisenhower as tired and unimaginative in foreign affairs--and the authors offer no more balanced perspective.
Quotes from Castro appear as English translations of Russian translations of the original Spanish.
