Although not the pivotal player one might have assumed it to be, the Soviet intelligence community nevertheless performed an essential service in informing the Kremlin about the United States and Cuba in The activities of Soviet intelligence in the Cuban missile crisis reveal much about the state of Soviet information gathering at the time and the analytical contribution made by the secret services.
Originally described by United States intelligence as 'reclusive', Feklisov and his assistants eventually developed extensive contacts.
But the Soviets had a much harder time penetrating the United States government itself.
The Cubans responded positively to Soviet offers of intelligence assistance and a few men were sent from Havana to Soviet intelligence schools in The Soviets offered to build a signals intelligence service for the Cubans in the summer of Moscow, which was able to read Cuban diplomatic correspondence, assumed that the United States could as well.
The process was set in train when news reached Moscow of some candid comments that President Kennedy had made in a meeting with Khrushchev's son-in-law Aleksei Adzhubei on 30 January Adzhubei's report that Kennedy was impatient with the status quo in Cuba shook the Kremlin and re-opened a debate over Fidel Castro's security that had started at the Cuban leader's instigation in September A few months after the Bay of Pigs, Castro had requested a qualitative improvement in Soviet military assistance to his regime.
In July 1960, the KGB had written that a United States invasion of Cuba was unlikely unless the Cubans invaded the United States naval base at Guantanamo or the Soviets themselves attempted to put nuclear missiles on the island.
Evidence from America's European allies shed little light on Washington's objectives regarding Cuba in Moscow acquired the report of a NATO committee empaneled in September 1961 to investigate Latin America.
There was nothing here to help an assessment of Kennedy's feelings toward Cuba in It seemed that the young man admitted his unhappiness about the failure at the Bay of Pigs and was looking for European support in isolating Cuba.
But, once again, there was nothing in this basket of information about United States designs in The KGB's spring assessment of Kennedy's immediate plans for Cuba was equivocal because its man in Washington doubted that an American military intervention was on the horizon.
Although the KGB did not supply any significant information on United States activities, the organization played a role in providing the Kremlin with worrisome reports on the state of Cuban-Soviet relations.
In response to the loss of one of its closest allies in Havana, the Kremlin ordered the intrepid Aleksandr Alekseev back from Cuba in April Aleksandr Shelepin, Semichastny's predecessor, participated in the decision to elevate Alekseev to the position of Soviet Ambassador to Cuba in the 14 SOVIET INTELLIGENCE 75 wake of the Escalante affair.
The Kremlin records for the decision do not include anything resembling a Soviet military intelligence assessment of United States intentions toward Cuba.
This source, who was considered reliable and whose reports were passed on to the Soviet leadership, reported that between 6 and 12 June 1961, the United States had decided to launch a nuclear strike on the USSR in September It was due only to the Soviet announcement of the new series of atomic tests that the United States reversed its decision.
Unable to break any high-level United States ciphers, the signals intelligence component of the KGB focused on analyzing the volume of United States communications traffic.
The Presidium appears not to have had any special advance warning of John F Kennedy's speech to the nation on Monday, 22 October.
It was in the context of this barren reporting from the United States that Gorsky's coup on the evening of October loomed large.
The United States military routinely transmitted changes to the Defense Condition status of Americans forces en clair, in an unclassified form.
Feklisov and Scali had been meeting infrequently since the end of On 6 July 1962, for example, Scali had discussed with Feklisov Secretary of State Rusk's recent trip to Europe.
In essence, the Soviets were looking for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, involving a United States commitment to lift the blockade and a pledge not to try to invade Cuba in return for the removal of the Soviet missiles.
