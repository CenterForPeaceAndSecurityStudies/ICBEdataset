Two years after he became President a major Cold War crisis erupted involving the island of Cuba, which was very close to the USA mainland.
In the early 1960s, Cuba had become a Communist state and was led by Fidel Castro.
Cuba began to develop close ties with the USSR and this caused problems for the new USA President.
As a result of this, Castro began to develop even closer economic and military links with the USSR and its leader, Khrushchev.
In 1962 a USA U2 spy plane took photos of a missile launch site being built in Cuba.
Also ships from the USSR were heading in the direction of Cuba with what looked like parts of missiles.
President Kennedy then came under pressure from one group of military advisors who wanted to bomb the missile sites and another group who wanted to set up a naval blockade around the island.
In the end Kennedy ordered a blockade to be set up to prevent these ships getting to Cuba.
To prevent the spreading of the other beliefs they threatened each other with nuclear warfare one of the biggest examples being the Cuban missile crisis.
Although both Truman and Stalin helped increase tensions in Europe and East Asia in the years immediately following World War II, the Cold War itself was likely inevitable.
The alliance that had formed between the United States and the USSR during World War II was not strong enough to overcome the past decades of suspicion and unease between the two nations.
Between October 14th to October 28th of 1962, the two countries at the time almost started World War III over missiles that were secretly placed in Cuba by the Soviet Union.
Communism is a political ideology which has the central principle of ¡§communal or communist ownership¡¨ of all property and therefore the abolition of private property.
