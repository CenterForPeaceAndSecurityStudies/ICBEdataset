To mark this pivotal event of the Cold War period, which nearly led to the extinction of all life on our planet, the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford will be holding a day of free talks and workshops for visitors.
This free exciting and incisive talk will take place in the Museumâ€™s Conference Room at 11:30am and 2:30pm and will last approximately 30 minutes each.
Re-enactor Jed Jaggard will be running interactive workshops throughout the day in a range of displays including; an indoor tent re-creating a Civil Defence Post scenario with emergency supplies and communications equipment.
Members of the public will be invited to join the Royal Observer Corps mobile team, plotting fall-out and casualties using actual equipment that would have been used during such a crisis.
On show will also be a small display on the V-Force and Thor nuclear missiles with equipment from the period including British Army equipment.
All interactive workshops will take place under the wings of the VForce aircraft in the National Cold War Exhibition.
The United States President of the day, John Fitzgerald Kennedy ordered a naval blockade against Soviet ships bringing military equipment to the island, with the threat of retaliation if the blockade was broken.
The situation threatened to escalate into a full-scale conflict between the Superpowers as Soviet President; Khrushchev considered whether to accept the challenge thrown down by the Americans.
Just six days after the United States ships moved into the path of the Soviet vessels, Khrushchev ordered his convoy to turn back and agreed to dismantle the Cuban bases.
The talks and workshops taking place at the Museum on 15th October are free of charge and open to any visitors or school groups interested in or studying the topic.
The Museum is open daily from 10am to 6pm with last admission at 5.00pm.
