Preferred Citation , Jay Lovestone papers, , Hoover Institution Archives.
Acquisition Information Materials were acquired by the Hoover Institution Archives in 1975.
Within the two groups materials are arranged in series by physical form or topic.
In 1937, it became the Independent Communist Labor League and in 1938, the Independent Labor League of America.
In addition to the official names given to the group, it was also variously known as the Lovestone Group or the Lovestoneites.
DAMAGED MATERIAL Scope and Content Note Consists of papers removed from the collection because of fragile and poor condition.
However smaller additions to the collection continued to be received throughout Lovestone's life and, via his estate, after his death in 1990.
As might be expected these materials date disproportionately from the later years of Lovestone's life, but they include much earlier material as well.
Most of the pre-1980 material represented in the Addendum is certainly unique within the collection.
It was not practicable to search systematically for possible duplication of each item in the Addendum materials, and no attempt was made to do so.
The pseudonym ""Comrade F."" appears to depend on context, and may mean either Ferguson or Fraina.
Scope and Content Note Printed articles about Jay Lovestone arranged chronologically PRINTED SUBJECT FILE 1904-1989.
