We believe that the current situation within Cuba favors this consolidation.
The mere passage of time tends to favor Castro as Cubans and others become accustomed to the idea that he is here to stay and as his regime gains in experience.
It is unlikely that internal political opposition or ' *f""""|°""^ d ^-ff y i S s n n , will cause the regime to collapse.
But his deatn ^^^^r^'omlorm^^^^T^^^tr ranging from power struggles within the regime's leadership to open civil war.
Any successor h likely to be more dependent upon the Soviets than Castro has been because he will lack Castro's ability to command the loyalty of substantial numbers of Cubans.
Furthermore, even under the most favorable circumstances, any opposi»'on would have to have the support of a large part of the military before it could hope to overthrow the Communist regime, and would have to UAe account of lbs presence of Soviet troops.
I The Soviet military picture in Cuba is in transition with a scaling down of their forces becoming apparent.
The totolSoviet inima rv strength in Cuba is now estimated to be about JHSBBHSf ft but we cannot exclude the possibility that there could be several thousand more.
The Soviets remain in control of the key weapons systems, while training the Cubans to operate some of them.
We believe the Soviets have told the Cubans that they intend eventually to turn various weapons, systems over to them.
Castro probably still believes that revolution will come only through violence, but the regime's exhortations on the subject have been muted recently.
The Soviets will continue with the more traditional efforts, at penetration through diplomacy and economic overtures.
In general, we believe that situations are unlikely to develop in which Castro could intervene with substantial force withou^renderir.g himself vulnerable to United States or OAS counteraction, f""™™""""™"""" H While the Soviets and Cubans have probably resolved their more immediate problems we foresee varying degrees of friction in their future relations, particularly over the long run.
They probably have not reached a fundamental reconciliation of their appraisals of the situation in Latin America, and Castro appears to insist on a unique position in the Bloc without submitting to the discipline and control imposed on Soviet Satellites, Nevertheless, Castro has taken a l ong st ep toward the Soviet side S Sino-Soviet controversy. \~~ se«a6J^ in iff**, -&™^ '. *&ax«J2*m£>*^ DISCUSSION I CURRENT SITUATION 1.

The limited capabilities el the Cuban Armed Forces are gradually improving as a mult of tbeir experience and Increased training aince last fall and their growing familiarity with Soviet equipment^ 4.
Identifying Soviet military peraoanel entering Cuba and estimating their number has been, a problem ef gmti dif3culty f r om ^J^,,®^,,' the buildup in 1&S2.
AM-iiS. -fc^ .-.'■' -i We believe that there has been & reduction in the Soviet personnel At the four armored camps.
Some Cubcn military personnel are present and undergoing training at all four of the camps, and a reliable report presents good evidence that one has bren evacuated by the Soviets and partially occupied by the Cubans, However, the equipment remains &t all the camps.
The numerical strength of the Cuban ground forces has been estimated at 275.000. of whom some 75.000 are in the standing army and 100.000 In the ready reserve.
The capabilities of Ihe standing army and ready reserve have been enhanced by new equipment, and by further training and experience including the mobilization during the missile .crisis.
A fevt divisions may now be capable of tactical operalions, althou gh the b a ttalio njcombat^tfa m^remains^ent .-ally the basic b tactical unit.

Training of Cuban; The reduction in Soviet military personnel in Cuba since February has been accompanied by increasing Indications of Cubans training in the operation of Soviet equipment and lystems, which suggests that the Soviet* plan a turnover of part or til of these systems to the Cubans.
One class of 22 pilot* began training in March JCC3. and a second of about the same aize is scheduled to begin in September; Cubans are also almost certainly being trained in ground controi snd maintenance. sscsrr ■hf Cuban Air Force could man | theM^2^TstembTmid^4j ^^^ ^ WMr __ i Mi ^ m | t Cubans are being ^^^^^^eT^^i^iheTp^oa^d^&mien&nce of Soviet ground equipment.

His persona) indispensability has enabled him to surmount b*>th a challenge from old-hne Communists in Cube, and a crisis in his relations with Moscow.
It has also enabled fcixa.to obsorb some economic setbackswitho""* «^«""« «** to his regi The completion ■^u^3Su5S""«lBhtTr^W« Castro wF* another jneam of control and an important instrument for political indjctrjnaMgnj^ tlon of the populace.
The Cuban economy declined sharply during 1960-1962, and there Is almost certain to be some further decline In output during 1963.
Nevertheless, the Cuban economic situation is not a critical source of weakness for the Castro regime and Is unlikely to become one.
Whatever the level of Cuban export earnings in 1963, Bloc assistance probably will permit the malntenence of essential imports — foodstuffs, fuels, Industrial materials, and machine parts— ^.t about the 1962 level.
Meanwhile the political effects of economic decline have been mitigated by the radical change in the pattern of distribution of available consumer goods and nrtces.
Cuba's production of sugar has declined In SD63 and its volume of exports prUably will be more than one-third below that of 19S2.
Communists and non-Communists, who are committed to violent revolution continue to look to Castro for help, particularly from his training program in Cuba (1, 00b*1.500 Latin Americans received Communist indoctrination or training in guerrilla warfare in 1062) and his large-scale d> semination of printed and broadcast propaganda.
At this time. pro-Castro revolutionaries are persistently active and aggressive only in Venezuela, Castro's priority target for revolution in Latin America.
On balance, the revolutionaries have lost ground in recent months in their efforts to weaken the Betancouit government through terrorism and sabotage.
The sense of urgency created throughout Latin _xnerica by the missile base crisis fats faded, but a considerable residue remains, especially in Central America.
Among the small countries of Central America the crisis heightened pressures for a definite _olutlon to the Cuban problem.
We believe that Castro and the Soviets are probably convinced that time can be made to work in Cuba's favor, providing the United States is not presented with a pretext for di rect intervention or drastic measures such ps some form of quarantine. i In short, the USSR and Cuba probably Tntend to play for time, avoid provocations likely to lead to United States intervention, withhold unnecessary concessions, and repair the damage to their prestige.
Each will continue to employ flexible tactics In Latin America varied according to the political situation in particular countries.
We expect that both the Soviets and Castro will adopt aggressive tactics whenever presented with tempting opportunities, and their appreciation of what constitutes a tempting opportunity will probably differ as tune passes.
HM «e would expect the Castro regime to be more firmly establi; a year hence than it is today.
This is not k> say that alt Soviet military personnel will be withdrawn from Cuba; indeed, it Is highly likely that the Soviets will maintain ft algnlflcant presence there.
With respect to the SAM system, we doubt that the Soviets have specified an jxact date for transfer of operational control or would u rr j out luch an agreement if subsequent developments produced new dangers.
We believe that the current situation favors the further consolidation of Castro's Communist regime in Cuba.
Castro were to die, members and supporters of the regime, p forces, would probably rail"" 44.
We believe that economic recovery in Cub* will be slow; it will take at least several years before the 1958 level of production is regained.
There has been UtUe noticeable improvement ao far in the key areas of economic organisation, managerial efflclencr and worker incentives— aotable weaknesses in Bloc countries generally.
On the other hand, the Soviet Union probably is prepared to provide developmental assistance to Cuba for a prolonged period.
The Soviets_apparently have backed away from some of the more ambitious industrial projects talked of previously, such as « large steel plant and & petroleum refinery; but a number of more modest industrial projects are moving ahead, as are proj ects for expanding agricultural production and for mineral exploration. fSsmmmm hKmma^m^immiiia s mmm^^ ^-^ — «*, Latin American Poliefat the Cuban revolution is a model for them to fellow.
The joint Khruahchev-Castro communique held up Cuba as an example for the rest of Latin America, but without endorsing Castro's earlier general incitement to revolution throughout the area.
Castro probably still believes that revolution will come only through violence, but the regime's exhortations on Ihe subject have been muted recently.
In part, this is because of Castro's disillusionment with the lack of revolutionary fervor among Latin American Communists, with the notable exception of Venezuela More important, he probably feels that he has no choice but to bide his time and build up subversive assets for the future.
Such a position has probably been strongly urged by Moscow and leading Latin American Communists who fear Castro will upset th*lr own strategics.
The tenor of the joint communique of 23 Mav would suggest that Castro has accepted, at least for the present, a more cautious and flexible line with respect to revolution in Latin America.
M *"" Cub TT^°~~ ~~ nlsts ani do not contemplate turning over their controls to Castro.
Nevertheless, they have given Castro a certain weight by describing him as the forerunner of Communist advance in Latin America, and therefore his views may tend to be more influential with other Latin American Communists.
While we believe that the Soviets and Cubans have come to grips with some of their problems and have probably resolved the more immediate ones, the Cuban situation is clouded by many uncertainties and _ Soviet-Cuban relations are far from permanently stabilized, i 50.
Castro, while in the USSR, showed a willingness to accept the Soviet line of peaceful coexistence and to recognize the Soviet Union's leadership of the Communist movement.
On the other hand, some of the more sensitive points of dispute between the Chinese and the Soviets were not mentioned in the communique of 23 ££ay.
Nevertheless, Castro did take a long step toward the Soviet tide in the Sine-Soviet controversy.
In turn Ctstro has received from the Soviet* a & g o; assurancea of continued economic s upportj ^^^^j &nd'recog^r"" Hon of Cuba's special importance ''aa"" 'an example'of wlfft the revolutionary struggle can achieve in Latin America.
Overall, Soviet and ''\' / •Jt >■ Lr Cuban fortunes have been bound more close*y together And their respective freedoms of action have been somewhat narrowed.
For the present, however, we believe that both the SovieLs and the Cubans hope to stabilize the situation and gird for a long-term effort in Latin America.
