His father, Angel, was a wealthy sugar plantation owner originally from Spain.
Raised in affluence while surrounded by poverty, Fidel Castro was educated in private Jesuit boarding schools.
He attended El Colegio de Belen and pitched for the school’s baseball team.
In 1947 Castro participated in a effort to overthrow the dictator Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic.
Its founder, Cuban presidential candidate Eduardo Chibas, lost the 1948 election but became a hero of sorts to Castro.
In 1948 Castro married Mirta Diaz Balart, who hailed from a wealthy Cuban family.
The couple had one child, Fidelito, before the marriage was dissolved in 1955.
In 1952 Castro ran as a candidate for a seat in the Cuban parliament, but a coup led by the country’s former president, General Fulgencio Batista, overthrew the existing government and cancelled the election.
Solidifying his power with Cuba’s military and economic elite, Batista established himself as a dictator.
The attack failed and Castro was captured and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
After being set free in 1955 under an amnesty deal with the Batista government, Castro traveled to Mexico, where he met Ernesto “Che” Guevara.
Guevara became an important confidante and advisor to Castro, and the pair conspired to overthrow the Batista regime by means of guerrilla warfare.
On December 2, 1956, Castro and 81 fellow insurgents returned to Cuba, near the eastern city of Manzanillo, to begin their protracted guerrilla campaign.
Castro organized resistance groups in cities and towns across the country.
Batista fled to the Dominican Republic, and a 32-year-old Fidel Castro seized control of Cuba.
Leftwing Monster Fidel Castro entered Havana on January 8, 1959, to wild acclaim from all quarters.
Most Cubans were jubilant; Castro was promising an end to the corrupt governments that had plagued Cuba since independence.
Private property would be secure, a free press guaranteed, friendly relations with the United States were essential.
Jack Paar never treated a guest on his Tonight Show as deferentially as he treated honored guest Fidel Castro.
Retired president Harry Truman called Castro a “good young man trying to do what’s best for Cuba.
The United States actually accorded diplomatic recognition to Castro’s government more quickly than it had recognized Batista’s in 1952.
In fact, the promptness of this United States recognition set a record for recognition of a Latin American government.
Six months later he confiscated all United States properties on the island; 5,911 businesses worth $2 billion, along with most property and businesses owned by Cubans.
On January 3, 1961, outgoing President Eisenhower finally declared, “there’s a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure.
They say you can boil a live frog in a pot by gradually turning up the heat.
He will not jump out, because he can’t tell the temperature’s changing.
Castro’s Revolution was a stealth revolution, done in stages, dividing and conquering till he had the whole prize.
Then they came for the big landowners and I didn’t protest because I didn’t have a Sugar mill; I had a small tobacco farm.
Then they came for the big businessmen and I didn’t protest because I was a small shopkeeper not a factory owner.
Large landholdings were initially “nationalized” on the pretext of “land reform” where the massive latifundia would be parceled out to landless peasants.
As with so much else regarding pre-Castro Cuba, major misconceptions abound in this editorial.
According to the Geneva-based International Labor Organization, the average daily wage for an agricultural worker in Cuba in 1958 was $3.
The average daily wage in France at the time was $2.73; in Belgium $2.70; in Denmark $2.74; in West Germany $2.73; and in the United States $4.06.
Confiscated farms remained in Cuban government hands as state farms on the Soviet model.
By early 1959, Soviet advisers from the Ukraine were already directing Castro’s Institute of Agrarian Reform.
As the pattern became clear, a major rebellion broke out in the Cuban countryside.
It took the Castroites 6 years, tens of thousands of troops, scores of Russian advisors, squadrons of Soviet tanks, helicopters, flame throwers, and a massive and brutal “re-location” campaign where thousands of rural families were uprooted at gunpoint and relocated to concentration camps at the very western tip of Cuba, to finally crush the rebellion.
One individual who was fortunate enough to escape to Miami recalls that “e fought with the fury of cornered beasts” against the occupation of Cuba that the Soviet Union carried out through its proxies, Castro and Guevara.
In fact — as a percentage of population — Cuba took in more immigrants in the 20th century than the United States took in — and this includes the Ellis Island years.
In 1958 the Cuban embassy in Rome had a backlog of 12,000 applications for immigrant visas from Italians clamoring to immigrate to Cuba.
Back then, people were as desperate to enter Cuba as they are now to escape.
By 1992 two million Cubans had fled Cuba, most against staggering odds and with only the clothes on their back.
By most estimates this is a tiny fraction of those who desired to leave.
A causeway from Havana to Key West in 1961 with the same free travel as existed in Cuba in 1958 would have emptied the island in two months.
Armando Lago, 83,000 Cubans have died at sea while attempting to leave Cuba.
At that point the Cuban government ceased publishing the statistics on the self-slaughter.
In 1958 Cuba had a higher standard of living than any Latin American country and half of Europe.
Cuban workers are more unionized than United States workers….the average wage for an 8-hour day in Cuba 1957 is higher than for workers in Belgium, Denmark, France and Germany.
In 1958 Cubans had the 3rd highest protein consumption in the hemisphere.
But in 1962 Castro’s government introduced ration cards that persist to this day.
Food Ration in 1842 Castro Gov. for slaves in Cuba: Ration since 1962: meat, chicken, fish — 8 oz 2 oz.
The half-starved slaves on the ship Amistad ate better than the average Cuban eats today.
And a revolutionary must become a cold killing machine motivated by pure hate.
Given the rate of firing squad executions in Cuba in the early 1960s, thousands of gallons of perfectly good, perfectly valuable blood gushed from the bodies of young men only to soak uselessly into the mud, wash into gutters, or get sopped up by buckets of sawdust.
By 1961 Cuba’s government was already desperately short on foreign exchange.
In two short years Castro had rendered a nation with a living standard higher than half of Europe and with a peso always on par with the United States dollar, utterly destitute, utterly bereft of foreign exchange.
The massive Soviet subsidies could never compensate for the destruction of Cuba’s vibrant pre-Castro economy.
In 1961 an ocean of fresh, plasma-rich Cuban blood was being freed from its confines by bullets and spilling in torrents daily.
Dozens of those murdered after sham trials were United States citizens.
Eighteen thousand bodies would eventually join Howard Anderson’s in mass graves.
Carlos Machado was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets shattered his bound body.
His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley.
On Christmas eve 1961, Juana Diaz spat in the face of the Castroite executioners who were binding and gagging her.
When the blast from that firing squad demolished her face and torso, Juana was six months pregnant.
Traditionally, firing squads have only two of its members with loaded guns.
In his, all ten members shot live ammunition — all ten bullets ripped into the staked hero or heroine.
This incorporated more members into Castro’s criminal organization, more members to resist desperately any overthrow of the system with the consequent settling of accounts.
According to the human rights group Freedom House, 500,000 Cubans passed through Castro’s prison camps.
At one time during 1961-62, some 300,000 Cubans were jailed for political offenses islandwide.
This made Castro’s political incarceration rate higher than Stalin’s and Hitler’s.
Also, the longest serving political prisoners of the century spent their hell in Castro’s Gulag.
Senores Mario Chanes de Armas, Angel de Fana, and Eusebio Penalver all served thirty years in Castro’s dungeons.
Consider that Alexander Solzhenitsyn served 8 years in Stalin’s Gulag as did Natan Scharansky.
Credit for finally exposing the horrors of Castro’s Gulag to a mass international audience must go to former political prisoner Armando Valladares and especially to his prison memoirs titled Against All Hope, released in 1984.
Castro’s extensive and murderous Gulag had been in operation for over two decades by then and had been exposed and denounced by many, as had Stalin’s in the 1930s and ’40s.
But just as it took the novelist Alexander Solzhenitzyn to finally shake the world awake about the Gulag thirty years after its murderous height, it took the poet Armando Valladares to expose Castroism to the mainstream, however late in the game.
In 1960 Valladares had been arrested in his office for the crime of refusing to display a pro-Castro sign on his desk.
Which is to say, they rejected any “rehabilitation,” or “re-education” by their jailers.
To this day he remains crippled from the beatings and starvings he endured in Castro’s Gulag.
Valladares managed to get his writings smuggled out of prison and into Europe.
In December 1977, forty-seven United States Senators signed an appeal for his release, and Amnesty International took up his cause.
International pressure, including personal appeals to Castro by his friend Francois Mitterand, finally won Valladares’ release in 1982.
In 1984 he released his prison memoirs, titled Against all Hope, and in 1986, immediately after having read them, Ronald Reagan appointed Valladares United States ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
The Kennedy-Khrushchev deal, with its subsequent roundup and jailing of anti-Castro fighters in the United States , pulled the plug on much of the anti-Castro resistance.
Youths were the target here, with special emphasis on long-hairs, rock & roll listeners and — especially — homosexuals.
In fact any youth who didn’t display a gung-ho “revolutionary” attitude was fair game.
Jehovah’s Witnesses, active Catholics and Protestants, along with children of political prisoners, were swept up in the dragnet.
The initials stood for Unidades Militares del Ayuda de Produccion,” or Military Units to Help Production, which were a special set of forced labor camps set up for young prisoners.
The official title did little to hide the pretext for the camps — forced labor.
These camps were completely enclosed by high barbed wire, had machine guns in each watchtower and ferocious dogs keeping watch below.
In fact the Cuban people had elected one President in 1945, Ramon Grau San Martin.
In this campaign homosexuals were identified, rounded up and thrown in prison where their uniforms sported a big P In the early and mid 1960s in Cuba, outing a homosexual to the police became a common practice for those seeking special favors or hoping to ingratiate themselves with the authorities.
The UMAP camps featured brutal labor in the tropical sun, and summary beatings and executions for any laggards.
Word about this savagery soon got out amongst the general population and discontent was rife.
After all, none of these prisoners had been convicted, even in the sham Castroite courts, of any counterrevolutionary crimes.
Military and police trucks would simply surround an area of Havana known as, say, a homosexual hang-out, and every person in sight would be herded into the military trucks at gunpoint.
In 1968, according to official government notice, the UMAPs were disbanded.
In a film titled Cursed Be Your Name, Liberty, Cuban exile Vladimir Ceballos documents how in the mid 1980s over one hundred Cuban youths deliberately injected themselves with the AIDS virus.
At the time, Castro’s Cuba had developed a very efficient method of dealing with the malady.
The patients were banished to “sanatoriums” in the middle of the countryside and were basically left alone till they died.
Apparently to some tortured souls, banishment in those AIDS sanitoriums smacked of freedom, as compared to life on the outside.
Jorge Pérez, an exiled Cuban physician and AIDS specialist, now living in Spain, reports that in the mid ’80s the Cuban government ran ads on national television showing that these AIDS sanitoria featured air-conditioning, color TVs, swimming pools, and three meals of excellent food daily.
Cuba’s population, of course, savored these things only in their dreams.
The ad was actually an attempt to snare volunteers for government experiments with AIDS vaccines.
Any successful vaccines discovered as a result would translate into a deluge of foreign currency for Castro.
As expected, the response to the ads was overwhelming, and the volunteers were interned in a sanitorium near Santiago de las Vegas in Havana province where they were injected with the AIDS virus.
Pérez reports that the strain used was particularly strong, and ninety percent of the volunteers died the typically agonizing and prolonged AIDS death within two years.
Khrushchev documents in his memoirs how Castro pleaded with him to launch a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the United States in October of 1962.
Some think Khrushchev’s fear of Castro’s officers somehow getting hold of the nuclear buttons was a bigger factor in his decision to remove the missiles than the “blockade” imposed by the Kennedy administration around Cuba at the time.
The prudence of Khrushchev’s decision was revealed the following month by Castro’s second-in-command, Che Guevara.
In this struggle to the death between 2 systems we must gain the ultimate victory.
He didn’t get his hands on the missiles but Castro emerged the big winner of the Missile Crisis.
It would be too much of a political embarrassment for us,” said Robert F Kennedy to Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin in October of 1962.
We ended up getting exactly what we’d wanted all along, security for Fidel Castro’s regime, and American missiles removed from Turkey.
With these factors in mind, the Castro regime’s longevity becomes much easier to understand.
The Cuban Program and Other Atrocities,” one of the primary objectives of this “program” was to determine how much physical and psychological agony a human being could withstand.
A Cuban nicknamed “Fidel,” the main torturer at the Zoo, initiated his own personal reign of terror.
Among Fidel’s torture techniques were beatings and whippings over every part of his victims’ bodies, without remission.
Earl Cobeil, an F-105 pilot, as Fidel forced him into the cell of fellow POW Col.
He was bleeding everywhere, terribly swollen, and a dirty, yellowish black and purple from head to toe.
Fidel smashed a fist into the man’s face, driving him against the wall.
Then he was brought to the center of the room and made to get down onto his knees.
Screaming in rage, Fidel took a length of black rubber hose from a guard and lashed it as hard as he could into the man’s face.
Again and again and again, a dozen times, Fidel smashed the man’s face with the hose.
Castro’s reign of terror against American POWs in Vietnam was just another reflection of the communist dictator’s barbarism and sadism.
After the end of the war, United States investigators launched a manhunt for the Cuban Program torturers.
In the midst of their search, investigators cataloged over 2,000 Cubans who had been in North Vietnam during the late 1960s.
More About Castro & His Revolution The Cuban Revolution started devouring its own children very early.
Revolutionary Cuba’s first figurehead president, Manuel Urrutia, fled into exile for his very life exactly 6 months after his appointment by Castro, who went on TV to brand Urrutia a “traitor” and threatened him with the paredon.
The badly rattled Urrutia watched Castro’s TV tirade from his very Presidential office that night in July of 1959 while convulsed in sobs.
Quickly gathering his wits, he scrambled out the back door of the building and later that night slunk into the Venezuelan embassy disguised as a milkman.
Commander Huber Matos was credited by Castro himself with “saving the revolution” when he flew a planeload of arms into the Sierra Maestra from Costa Rica in March of 1958.
The arms were donated by leftist Costa Rican President Jose “Pepe” Figueres and may have originated with the CIA, who in keeping with its support of the “Democratic Left” at the time, was very friendly with both Figueres and Castro’s July 26th Movement.
Reynolds made his pronouncement during a friendly chat with Fidel Castro himself at a “Bay of Pigs, 40 Years After” Conference held in Havana, in April 2001.
After arriving with the arms, Matos, a July 26th underground operative till then, was quickly named a “comandante” in the Rebel army as well.
In December of that year he led a rebel column into the city of Santiago, then entered Havana on January 8th atop the same Sherman tank with Fidel Castro.
Upon the Revolutionary triumph, Castro appointed Matos military commander of Camaguey province where Matos signed off on the prompt firing-squad executions of over 60 Batista soldiers, including a wounded one who was carried to the stake on a stretcher.
Fidel, we fought in the name of Truth, for all the sound principles that bind civilization and mankind together.
Raul Castro and Che Guevara wanted him immediately lined up at the paredon and executed.
With Matos’ trial most of the “moderates” still in Castro’s government had to finally face the music.
Most resigned, went underground, and then went into exile — in that order.
He refused any and all “rehabilitation” by his jailers and suffered horribly for it.
He was finally released in 1979 and lived in Miami until his death in February 2014.
Among other Revolutionary “Comandantes” who fought alongside Castro against Batista and served early in Castro’s regime, but weren’t quite as fortunate as Matos, were Humberto Sori Marin and William “El Americano” Morgan.
Humberto Sori Marin was arrested in April of 1961 as a counterrevolutionary and his brother Mariano went to visit Castro, pleading clemency for his brother.
If for no other reason than “for old times sake,” pleaded Mariano, recalling when Fidel and Humberto had been Revolutionary comrades.
The next day Mariano collapsed at the sight of his brother Humberto’s mangled corpse in a mass grave.
Castro’s firing squad had pumped over 20 shots into his brother’s body that very dawn.
Humberto Sori Marin’s head was almost completely obliterated, his face unrecognizable.
Castro’s executioners taunted the bound and helpless William Morgan as he glowered at Castro’s firing squad in April 1961.
Over the next few minutes as he lay writhing, four more bullets slammed into Morgan, all very carefully aimed to miss vitals.
Finally an executioner walked up and emptied a Tommy gun clip into Morgan’s back.
Cienfuegos was right up there with the Castro brothers and Che in the Revolutionary hierarchy.
He’d landed on the Granma expedition from Mexico, then fought in the Sierra from day one, climaxing the rebellion by commanding rebel forces in the decisive “battle” of Santa Clara that finally forced Batista to lose hope and flee the island.
Camilo actually entered Havana before Castro, where he promptly took command of the military headquarters at Camp Colombia.
Camilo Cienfuegos was handsome, charismatic, and in the eyes of many, actually outshone Fidel at early Revolutionary rallies, often stealing the limelight with his ready smile and humor.
Fidel asked Such deference was — to say the least — not a Castro trademark.
Camilo had flown to Camaguey from Havana for the hateful task of arresting his friend and ally Matos.
The two had often discussed, with growing alarm, what they saw as the Communist usurpation of the Cuban Revolution.
Once in Camaguey, Camilo had a violent row with Raul Castro, whom he’d always loathed.
They were on the verge of fisticuffs and drawn pistols when finally separated.
On the flight back to Havana after he dutifully arrested Matos, Camilo Cienfuegos disappeared without a trace.
His plane crashed and vanished, said the authorities, though the evening had excellent weather according to all records.
The Castro brothers made a big show of a search and rescue but nothing turned up.
To many, including Huber Matos, Camilo’s death seemed much too convenient.
To this day, most Cuban-exiles blame Fidel and Raul for Camilo’s death.
Interestingly, two of Camilo’s loyal lieutenants died in “accidents” within days of their commander’s disappearance.
The head of Camaguey’s small airport, from where Camilo had taken off, was also suspicious and was starting to ask questions about the rescue effort.
Two weeks after Camilo’s disappearance, he was found with a bullet through his head.
Camilo Cienfuegos was far from the last Fidelista Comandante to run afoul of Fidel’s megalomania.
Arnaldo Ochoa was the Cuban General widely credited with Cuba’s victories in both The Angolan Civil War and in Ethiopia’s early crushing of the Eritrean rebellion.
They say he was a soldiers’ general, who always showed genuine interest in the welfare of his men and so had the respect and admiration of the lowliest troops.
Besides his African ventures, Arnaldo Ochoa had fought in the Sierra as a Rebel and helped crush the Escambray peasant rebellion in 1961.
In 1963 he infiltrated Venezuela to train and lead guerrillas trying to overthrow Romulo Betancourt.
Later he transferred to Nicaragua where he led the fight against the Contras.
In the dawn hours of July 13, 1989, General Arnaldo T Ochoa was executed by a firing squad outside of Havana.
Nothing of the sort occurred with Fidel Castro and his generals, no matter how battle-hardened or loyal.
The official charge was drug smuggling, and Ochoa was almost certainly guilty.
In Africa, Ochoa had used black marketing of everything from elephant tusks to diamonds to liquor, to help finance his military operations.
By 1989, United States Federal prosecutors had uncovered the Cuban military’s role in cocaine smuggling into the United States Fidel and Raul watched the case building against them with growing alarm.
In the defecting Air Force General’s very well-informed opinion, Castro executed Ochoa “to rid himself of an independent-minded man while diverting public attention from the island’s mounting problems.
Castro used the excuse of corruption to destroy Ochoa because he often chose his own course in making decisions.
Ochoa was a pragmatic, non-ideological man, who was flexible enough to recognize the sense behind Gorbachev’s reforms of the time.
That Glasnost and Perestroika stuff could be contagious, in other words.
Ochoa’s and De la Guardia’s deaths did nothing to curb Cuba’s role in drug smuggling.
On December 3, 1998, Colombian police seized seven tons of cocaine in Cartagena, Colombia.
Four grand juries at the time had disclosed Cuba’s role in drug smuggling into the United States The Clinton administration, hellbent on cozying up to Castro at the time, refused to press ahead with the case against the Castro brothers’ dope trafficking.
He was credited with the murder of fellow student Manolo Castro, and the attempted murder of Leonel Gomez, whom he shot through the throat but who survived.
The off-duty Caral sat on his doorstep with his 5 year old son on his knee when Fidel Castro approached and shot him point-blank in the chest.
Raphael Diaz-Balart, Castro’s brother-in-law at the time, recalls an agitated Fidel bursting into his apartment that day.
That same year Castro traveled to Bogota, Colombia, where he was among the ringleaders in the famous Bogotazo, a Communist-inspired riot that ended up killing 5,000 people.
Castro’s July 26th Movement — his anti-Batista revolutionary group — was actually a pioneer in 20th century terrorism.
In the last months of 1958, members of Castro’s movement hijacked three different Cubana airliners at gunpoint.
The last one was a flight from Miami to Varadero that was diverted at gunpoint to rebel-held territory in Cuba’s eastern Oriente province.
Despite the pilot’s frantic pleas, the plane was forced to attempt a landing on a tiny airstrip near Raul Castro’s rebel camp, where it crashed in a huge fireball.
A few months earlier, Castro’s rebels had kidnapped 50 United States citizens near Guantanamo.
A few were civilian workers from a United States mining company headquartered nearby.
Though the term was not in vogue at the time, Castro’s guerrillas used these American hostages as “human shields” against the Batista air force’s sporadic bombings of rebel-held areas.
The last thing Batista wanted was more raging by the United States media against him — not that it could have gotten much worse.
Castro had only been in power for two months when he started sending armed guerrillas to attempt the overthrow of neighboring nations.
The Dominican Republic, Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela were the early targets.
Basically this involved massive loans, financial aid and shipments of free oil to Castro from Venezuela.
Betancourt balked, and no sooner had Castro returned home empty-handed, than he was planning subversion in Venezuela, including assassination attempts against Betancourt.
By mid-2005, some 160,000 barrels of oil were flowing from Venezuela to Cuba daily.
This was much more oil than Cuba’s refineries could process, because most of this oil was resold to Central American nations by Cuba, who pocketed the handsome profit.
Here was the second half of the “master plan against the gringos,” that Castro had originally proposed to Romulo Betancourt.
Castro’s subversion — not just of his neighbors, but throughout Latin America, the Middle East and Africa — reached a point where the United States Defense Department estimated that 42,000 foreign guerrillas and terrorists had received their training in Cuba.
On November 17, 1962, the FBI uncovered a terrorist plot that targeted Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal and the Statue of Liberty, along with the Macy’s, Gimbels and Bloomindales department stores.
The explosions were planned for November 27, 1962, the day after Thanksgiving, the busiest shopping day of the year.
The chief plotter was Roberto Santiesteban, chief aide to Cuba’s United Nations ambassador, Carlos Lechuga.
Under him were Elsa and Jose Gomez, also employed by Cuba’s diplomatic mission at the United Nations The rest of the conspirators belonged to The Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
Had those detonators gone off, thousands of people would have died in a matter of seconds.
The plan was for both Republican presidential candidates of the day — incumbent President Gerald Ford and former California governor Ronald Reagan — to be assassinated during the Republican National Convention in San Francisco.
The Emiliano Zapata Unit, a Bay Area radical-terrorist group, was slated to make the hits.
When arrested, one of the would-be assassins named Gregg Daniel Adornetto, revealed the Cuban connection.
Adornetto had met him years earlier when he’d traveled to Cuba for training and funding as a member of the Weather Underground.
Much evidence points to an earlier assassination plot by Castro against a United States President succeeding.
Many of those closest to the early evidence are convinced that Castro made good on his boast.
Haig served as a military aide under both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
The classified intelligence report that so rattled Haig and caused so many faces to go ashen, described how a few days before the Dallas assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, accompanied by Castro intelligence agents, had been spotted in Havana, where he’d traveled from Mexico City.
Amidst a stack of declassified Soviet correspondence that Boris Yeltsin made available to President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s was a letter from Jacqueline Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev dated just ten days after the assassination.
Kennedy assures the Soviet leader that she doesn’t suspect Soviet involvement in her husband’s assassination.
For 34 years Markus Wolf was the chief of East Germany’s foreign intelligence service, a branch of the STASI with many contacts and operations in Castro’s Cuba.
It was the STASI rather than the KGB that undertook the training of Castro’s police and intelligence services.
Wolf’s autobiography is titled Man Without a Face, and subtitled The Autobiography of Communism’s Greatest Spymaster.
Wolf was once asked about the Kennedy assassination and quickly replied.
Vadim Kotchergine and set up massive terrorist training camps in western Cuba.
In 1968 Castro sent military instructors into Palestinian bases in Jordan to train Palestinian Fedayeen.
In November 1974 Castro personally decorated his brother-in-arms, Yasir Arafat, with Cuba’s highest honor, the Bay of Pigs Medal.
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the infamous “Carlos The Jackal” known as the world’s most notorious terrorist throughout the 1970’s, received his training in Cuba and lived there for years.
The United States State Department listed Cuba prominently among its “State Sponsors of Terrorism” from 1982-2015.
Among these were cop-killers Michael Finney, Charlie Hill, and Joanne Chesimard, along with Victor Gerena, who was responsible for a $7 million heist of a Wells Fargo truck in Connecticut in 1983 as a member of the Puerto Rican terrorist group Los Macheteros.
All requests for their extradition had been repeatedly ignored or rebuffed.
By 1976 Castro’s intervention abroad became more blatant when he sent tens of thousands of troops to Africa.
Most — 50,000 of them — went to fight Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA forces in Angola.
Thousands more went to prop up the Marxist Mengistu regime in Ethiopia.
And others were scattered throughout the continent from Guinea Bissau to Bourkina Fasso to Sierra Leone to Mozambique to Zimbabwe.
All told, by 1983, Cuban troops were stationed in 20 sub-Saharan African nations.
After defecting in 1964, Castro’s own sister brought the unmistakable message to Congress.
According to General Rafael del Pino — onetime head of Castro’s Air Force, who defected in 1987 during the United States invasion of Grenada — Castro ordered military plans for the destruction of the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant south of Miami.
With his nuclear weapons having been snatched back by Khrushchev in October of 1962, Castro here was opting for the next-best thing.
In pursuit of his obsession to harm America, Castro also made alliance with Iran.
In late July 2006, Castro handed the reins of Cuba’s government temporarily to his brother and a few cabinet ministers, after undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.
Fidel Castro remained in poor health even following the surgery, though he continued to play an active role in running government affairs from behind the scenes over the ensuing year-and-a-half.
On February 19, 2008 — just five days before the Cuban National Assembly was scheduled to meet to select a new head of state — Fidel Castro announced his permanent resignation in a letter to his countrymen which was read on Cuban radio and television.

The thousands of accusations of violations of human rights in Cuba conflicted with the double standard then current at the United Nations The posture of many countries was governed by their hostility against the United States, and they excused Castro out of a reflexive anti-Americanism.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*****\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 1965, counterrevolutionary activity was winding down in Cuba.
Now the Castro regime, needing new pretext for mass jailings and the cowing of the population, turned its police loose on \u0026#8220;anti-social elements,\u0026#8221; on \u0026#8220;deviants\u0026#8221; and on \u0026#8220;delinquents.\u0026#8221; Youths were the target here, with special emphasis on long-hairs, rock \u0026amp; roll listeners and \u0026#8212; especially \u0026#8212; homosexuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact any youth who didn\u0026#8217;t display a gung-ho \u0026#8220;revolutionary\u0026#8221; attitude was fair game.
The initials stood for Unidades Militares del Ayuda de Produccion,\u0026#8221; or Military Units to Help Production, which were a special set of forced labor camps set up for young prisoners.
The official title did little to hide the pretext for the camps \u0026#8212; forced labor.
In this campaign homosexuals were identified, rounded up and thrown in prison where their uniforms sported a big P In the early and mid 1960s in Cuba, outing a homosexual to the police became a common practice for those seeking special favors or hoping to ingratiate themselves with the authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UMAP camps featured brutal labor in the tropical sun, and summary beatings and executions for any laggards.

At the time, Castro\u0026#8217;s Cuba had developed a very efficient method of dealing with the malady.
The patients were banished to \u0026#8220;sanatoriums\u0026#8221; in the middle of the countryside and were basically left alone till they died. \u0026#8220;Left alone\u0026#8221; is the key phrase here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently to some tortured souls, banishment in those AIDS sanitoriums smacked of freedom, as compared to life on the outside.
Jorge Pérez, an exiled Cuban physician and AIDS specialist, now living in Spain, reports that in the mid \u0026#8217;80s the Cuban government ran ads on national television showing that these AIDS sanitoria featured air-conditioning, color TVs, swimming pools, and three meals of excellent food daily.
Cuba\u0026#8217;s population, of course, savored these things only in their dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ad was actually an attempt to snare volunteers for government experiments with AIDS vaccines.

Revolutionary Cuba\u0026#8217;s first figurehead president, Manuel Urrutia, fled into exile for his very life exactly 6 months after his appointment by Castro, who went on TV to brand Urrutia a \u0026#8220;traitor\u0026#8221; and threatened him with the paredon.
President Urrutia\u0026#8217;s offense had been some mild criticism of Communism.
The badly rattled Urrutia watched Castro\u0026#8217;s TV tirade from his very Presidential office that night in July of 1959 while convulsed in sobs.
In December of that year he led a rebel column into the city of Santiago, then entered Havana on January 8th atop the same Sherman tank with Fidel Castro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the Revolutionary triumph, Castro appointed Matos military commander of Camaguey province where Matos signed off on the prompt firing-squad executions of over 60 Batista soldiers, including a wounded one who was carried to the stake on a stretcher.

To many, including Huber Matos, Camilo\u0026#8217;s death seemed much too convenient.
To this day, most Cuban-exiles blame Fidel and Raul for Camilo\u0026#8217;s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCienfuegos was too obviously their competitor for leadership.

The head of Camaguey\u0026#8217;s small airport, from where Camilo had taken off, was also suspicious and was starting to ask questions about the rescue effort.
Two weeks after Camilo\u0026#8217;s disappearance, he was found with a bullet through his head.
He was an austere individual devoted to military life and his hands are not stained with blood.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say he was a soldiers\u0026#8217; general, who always showed genuine interest in the welfare of his men and so had the respect and admiration of the lowliest troops.
Ochoa was also close and on very friendly terms with both Fidel and Raul Castro, the latter being Ochoa\u0026#8217;s immediate superior, whom the General always affectionately called \u0026#8220;jefe.\u0026#8221; Besides his African ventures, Arnaldo Ochoa had fought in the Sierra as a Rebel and helped crush the Escambray peasant rebellion in 1961.

Nothing of the sort occurred with Fidel Castro and his generals, no matter how battle-hardened or loyal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA court martial had found Ochoa guilty of \u0026#8220;corruption and dishonest use of economic resources,\u0026#8221; of \u0026#8220;departing from the principles of the Revolution,\u0026#8221; and of \u0026#8220;committing grave moral and legal violations of socialist law.\u0026#8221; The official charge was drug smuggling, and Ochoa was almost certainly guilty.
In fact, some of the evidence used against Ochoa at his trial is rumored to have originated with the FBI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafael Del Pino mentions another reason for Ochoa\u0026#8217;s elimination.
In the defecting Air Force General\u0026#8217;s very well-informed opinion, Castro executed Ochoa \u0026#8220;to rid himself of an independent-minded man while diverting public attention from the island\u0026#8217;s mounting problems.
Ochoa was a pragmatic, non-ideological man, who was flexible enough to recognize the sense behind Gorbachev\u0026#8217;s reforms of the time.
Even worse, Ochoa, like many other Cuban military officers, was trained in the Soviet Union and had close ties to the Soviet leaders then involved in the reforms.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Glasnost and Perestroika stuff could be contagious, in other words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOchoa\u0026#8217;s and De la Guardia\u0026#8217;s deaths did nothing to curb Cuba\u0026#8217;s role in drug smuggling.
Castro\u0026#8217;s July 26th Movement \u0026#8212; his anti-Batista revolutionary group \u0026#8212; was actually a pioneer in 20th century terrorism.
In the last months of 1958, members of Castro\u0026#8217;s movement hijacked three different Cubana airliners at gunpoint.
The last one was a flight from Miami to Varadero that was diverted at gunpoint to rebel-held territory in Cuba\u0026#8217;s eastern Oriente province.
Despite the pilot\u0026#8217;s frantic pleas, the plane was forced to attempt a landing on a tiny airstrip near Raul Castro\u0026#8217;s rebel camp, where it crashed in a huge fireball.
Though the term was not in vogue at the time, Castro\u0026#8217;s guerrillas used these American hostages as \u0026#8220;human shields\u0026#8221; against the Batista air force\u0026#8217;s sporadic bombings of rebel-held areas.
The last thing Batista wanted was more raging by the United States media against him \u0026#8212; not that it could have gotten much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastro had only been in power for two months when he started sending armed guerrillas to attempt the overthrow of neighboring nations.
This was much more oil than Cuba\u0026#8217;s refineries could process, because most of this oil was resold to Central American nations by Cuba, who pocketed the handsome profit.

The chief plotter was Roberto Santiesteban, chief aide to Cuba\u0026#8217;s United Nations ambassador, Carlos Lechuga.
