And the Cubans were running all over the place trying to get up the beach.
And that transport ship they had out there got hit with an artillery round.
I knew it was on there because I was up on the bridge and I heard the officers talking.
And our captain said, they won’t be able to get their heavy equipment off.
See, I could eaves-drop on all this, because that was my station, up there in officers’ country, And he was talking to his officers and saying they wouldn’t be able to get their heavy equipment off that ship now, whatever their heavy equipment was.
One time was real close That’s when I saw them, some of them were lying on the beach, and I saw one artillery round come down, and I don’t know, maybe it’s my imagination.
But I saw some of them were running in the water, aiming to swim back to their boat maybe.
The year is 1962 three years since Fidel Castro took power during the Cuban Revolution and just one year after the botched attempt to remove him at the Bays of Pigs.
The Bay of Pigs failure left you looking weak and increasingly unpopular with the American voters.
Castro has aligned himself with the Soviet Union and has allowed them to begin the construction of long range missile sites on Cuban soil.
You must consider your options carefully, giving careful thought to the consequences of each option available to you.
I expressed our readiness and desire to find, through peaceful negotiation to solve the differences that divide us.
At the same time, I made clear that the United States could not tolerate any action on your part which disturbed the balance of power in the world.

Since an agreement is in sight, the Pentagon is looking for a pretext to thwart it.
Yesterday, you shot down one of them, yet previously you did not when they flew over your territory.
That step will be used by aggressors to their advantage, to further their aims.
Because of this we would like to advise you, in the spirit of friendship, to show patience, firmness and more firmness.
Naturally, if there is an invasion, it will be necessary to fight it with everything.
Now that a solution is being found -one that is in your favour and that guarantees against an invasion -the unbridled militarists in the Pentagon want to frustrate the agreement and provoke you into taking actions that could be used against you.

Chairman Khrushchev President Kennedy We consider an attack to be almost imminent within the next 24 to 72 hours.
I tell you this because I believe that the imperialists' aggressiveness makes them extremely dangerous, and that if they manage to carry out an invasion of Cuba -a brutal act in violation of universal and moral law -then that would be the moment to eliminate this danger forever, in an act of the most legitimate self-defence.

C Cartoon c 1962 In his memoirs, Khrushchev claims that the outcome of the missile crisis was a ""triumph of Soviet foreign policy and a personal triumph"", but few, even on the Soviet side, have seen it that way.
P Khrushchev's then foreign minister, the dour Andrei Gromyko, in his scanty memoir account of the Cuban events praises Kennedy as ""a statesman of outstanding intelligence and integrity"" but is silent on Khrushchev.
The Last Testament), published posthumously in 1974, touched only briefly on the Fidel Castro urged the Soviet Union to attack the United States in 1962 because he feared an American Robert Kennedy-Dobrynin meeting, but included the flat invasion of Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis, Nikita S Khrushchev said in portions of his memoirs statement that ""President Kennedy said that in exchange for the published today.
Khrushchev seems to confirm a longstanding rumour about the missile crisis.
He withdrawal of our missiles, he would remove American missiles quotes the Cuban leader as saying in 1962 that the Kremlin ''should launch a pre-emptive strike from Turkey and Italy,"" although he described this ""pledge"" as against the U.S.'' to prevent destruction of the Soviet missiles in Cuba.
Mr Castro ''totally failed to understand'' that Soviet missiles had been placed in Cuba to deter an American attack, not to attack the United States, he said.
NY Times / Article E H Kennedy was ruthless enough to do what was necessary, even if it meant fooling the American people big-time, and risking a PR fiasco if the news ever leaked.
If he hadn’t done this all the other gutsy steps of those valiant “ 13 days” wouldn’t have avoided war.
It was not enough that JFK didn't blink when the Soviet ships neared the “quarantine” line patrolled by the United States Navy; it was Kennedy's willingness to cut a deal, under the table, with the enemy that saved the day and the planet.

L We understand your situation and are taking into account your difficulties in this first stage following the elimination of the maximum tension that resulted from the threat of an attack by American imperialists which you expected at any moment.
We understand that for you, certain difficulties may have emerged as a consequence of the promises we made to the United States to withdraw the missile bases from Cuba in exchange for their promise to abandon their plans to invade Cuba and to prevent their allies in the West from doing so, to end their so-called ""quarantine"" their blockade of Cuba.
According to our ambassador, certain Cubans feel that the Cuban people would prefer a different kind of statement, one that would not deal with the withdrawal of the missiles.
