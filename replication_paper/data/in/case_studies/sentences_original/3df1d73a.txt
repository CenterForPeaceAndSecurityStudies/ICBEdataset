In 1962, the United States learned that the Soviet Union planned to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida, to support the new Caribbean Communist nation.
The wily Khrushchev thought the youthful Kennedy would back down when confronted.
Kennedy, however, was adamant that Russian ships transporting the missiles to Cuba would not be allowed to cross his American naval blockade.
Meanwhile, Castro encouraged the Soviet government to breach the blockade by threatening an alliance with China.
The situation changed hourly as Kennedy, Khrushchev, and their aides made decisions that had the potential to trigger a nuclear holocaust at any slight miscalculation by either side.
Both Kennedy and Khrushchev finally “stood down” due to fear of nuclear war and the resulting impact on their nations.
Plokhy breathes new life into the story with recently uncovered information from Ukrainian KGB documents on the drama.

Extremely well-written, the book reads like a Tom Clancy thriller that explores what really happened as the world watched in suspense.
