On October 16, 1962, Bundy told President Kennedy that CIA photo interpreters believed that Soviet launch sites for ground-to-ground offensive missiles were under way in Cuba.
In his interview conducted for War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, Bundy describes the two weeks of intensive closed-door debate on how best to get the missiles out of Cubaa situation that had caught him and his colleagues by surprise.
As the members of the Executive Committee the presidents handpicked group of nineteen men who advised him through the Cuban missile crisisdebated scenarios, Bundy saw his role as ensuring that all sides would be considered.
He recalls balancing the needs to debate and to act, the presidents focus on maintaining political control over delicate decisions that could lead to a military escalation, unexpected events along the way, the worst day of the crisis, and Nikita Khrushchev's October 28 decision to withdraw the missiles.
The interview closes with Bundys commentary on Berlin, the other nuclear crisis that marked this period; Defense Secretary McNamaras flexible response strategy; and the United States survivable strategic force as a vital deterrent to anybodys first strike.

Since World War II the Soviet Union had had a superiority in conventional forces in Europe.
