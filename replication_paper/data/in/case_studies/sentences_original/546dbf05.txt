Dobbs discovered a map in the National Archives that reveals for the first time the precise route taken by Captain Charles Maultsby as he was chased by Soviet Mig Fighters over the Chukotka Peninsula.
The Air Force was able to track Maultsby's flight route by intercepting Soviet Air Defense communications, but did not inform McNamara about the incident until Maultsby left Soviet air space, ran out of fuel, and glided home to Alaska.
In coming weeks, the National Security Archive will publish more of the key primary sources behind One Minute to Midnight.
New postings will cover such episodes as the storage and handling of Soviet nuclear weapons on Cuba, and the ""Eyeball to Eyeball"" confrontation between United States and Soviet ships that never happened.
