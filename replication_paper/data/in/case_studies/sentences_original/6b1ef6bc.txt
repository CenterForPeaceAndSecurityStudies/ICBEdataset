HAVANA â€“ The world stood at the brink of Armageddon for 13 days in October 1962 when President John F Kennedy drew a symbolic line in the Atlantic and warned of dire consequences if Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev dared to cross it.An American U-2 spy plane flying high over Cuba had snapped aerial photographs of Soviet ballistic missile sites that could launch nuclear warheads with little warning at the United States, just 90 miles away.
It was the height of the Cold War, and many people feared nuclear war would annihilate human civilization.Soviet ships carrying nuclear equipment steamed toward Kennedy's ""quarantine"" zone around the island, but turned around before reaching the line.
Kennedy's idea would be, 'Don't let this reach the point of confrontation,'"" he added.
The crisis was a triumph of United States brinkmanship.REALITY: Historians say the resolution of the standoff was really a triumph of backdoor diplomacy.Kennedy resisted pressure from aides advising that he cede nothing to Moscow and even consider a preemptive strike.
Washington won, and Moscow lost.REALITY: The United States came out a winner, but so did the Soviet Union.The Jupiter missiles are sometimes described as nearly obsolete, but they had come online just months earlier and were fully capable of striking into the Soviet Union.
Pastor said domestic politics made it tough for both Kennedy and successive presidents to heed that lesson, as evidenced by Kennedy's intense efforts to keep the deal secret.President Barack Obama, for example, faces considerable pressure to maintain a tough line on Cuba.
It was a high-seas showdown.REALITY: It's true the missile crisis was full of tense moments.
It was an intelligence coup for the CIA.REALITY: Along with being a day late on the turnaround by Soviet ships, the CIA missed several key developments that would have helped Kennedy and his advisers navigate the crisis.The CIA learned late in the game about the ballistic missiles' presence in Cuba, and they were already operational by the time Kennedy was informed of their existence.The agency was also unaware of other, tactical nuclear missiles in Cuba that could have been deployed against a United States attack.
