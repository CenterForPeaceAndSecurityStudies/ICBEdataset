However, contrary to Barack Obama's affinity for negotiating with tyrants, John F Kennedy's foreign policy towards communist dictators and tyrants was certainly not pacifistic by any stretch of the imagination.
Kennedy was badly outmatched by Khrushchev, and shortly after the summit, the Soviets built the Berlin Wall, which remained intact until the end of the Cold War.After the Vienna Summit, Khrushchev told his assistants that he wondered whether anyone who had abandoned the Cuban invading forces on the beaches would have the will to launch a nuclear attack.
In the aftermath of the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vienna Summit debacle, the Soviet Union began building missile sites in Cuba.
Kennedy, realizing it was imperative for him to respond strongly this time around, deployed a naval task force of nineteen ships to prevent missiles from entering Cuba.
In Barack Obama's view, this kind of ""tough talk and saber rattling"" only serves to strengthen the enemy.
Kennedy favored Joachim Balaguer as the temporary ruler of the Dominican Republic.
As a result of the United States Marine deployment, Trujillo and his supporters left the country.The ""Kennedy Doctrine"", as defined by Wikipedia, ""refers to foreign policy initiatives of John F Kennedy towards Latin America, during his term in office between 1961 and 1963.
While Kennedy did display a lack of resolve during the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vienna Summit a weakness which may have been the catalyst for Russia's decision to deploy nuclear missiles to Cuba the reader can see for himself that unlike Barack Obama, Kennedy sought to remove tyrants from power, while Obama seeks to coddle them.
