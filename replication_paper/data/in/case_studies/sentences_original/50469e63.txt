Ha wondered whether It night not b« useful if Mr Kuxneteor were to giro hia a oopy of the point* ho hod cmaerated.
Mr McCloy cemented that he did net reeognlae In Mr Kuzastsov'i language any of the Preaident'a language but he did reeognlae a good deal of Castro'a language, which waa not Inc or p orat ed in the Preaident'a acssage by any atreteh of Imagination.

Be aald he had a chart, whioh he would be happy to glr* to Mr Kuzneteor, wllch ahowed how aueh those aircraft could be -4. defense.
Paul, Denver, all of Mexico, Veneauela, Chile, and British Guiana, by not returning to Cuba and landing either in th. north or In tho aouth.
Surely, it would bo a anil loo. to lose a foir piano* or pilot* If one x±kis* wished to engage in such an operation.
Thu» it was quite clear that one could Be* 4*a4r£b*' the ZL-aB ae a coastal defenee aircraft, and any such ^««tb had to be **«-£&' * big grain of salt.

Severer, sines Messrs Stevenson and MeClsy had touched upon sojm questions which had been discus sod earlier, he wished to sake s brief eonasst.
He now wished to draw attention to the fact that W »•*& 4 ft Profit f* of vhat vu offenaiTe or dafenslre vould mm ensaclfi* la * tHJifsjrj discuesionj la any evanj the TSBR oeold not eeeept the OB nov as to vhat vu offensive sal vhat defensive.

The U8OT believed that any state had the right to be eeaeemed vith its secra-ity and to decide for Itself vhat «m vcr« required for its defenses.
Tbt USSS did not vish to bo drown Into o discussion of vhat the Cuban gevemntnl Tejejfled as offensive or defensive; ruch a dlsousilen could not brine us alo^r W% oolutlon of tho preblea at hand, because tho tee sides had differs** r}e*tt **. • tbU point. tho la hit latter, tho President hod recognised tho Hafe 4T ■•/. ttato to ax* Itoolf for defensive pvrpoees, and thla applied to Cuba oo veil.
Tho USSR hod not hoard any objection*?, by tho XM to thlo principle ao for, and if the UB had changed Its vlov it should say so.
As to vhat defensive Sorlot Delegation aeans vera needed by Cuba, tho mi/vas sot authorised to speak for Cuba; it vas not aathorlBod to be tho veiee of another sovereign state or sot on its behalf.
As far as tho substance of tho Batter vas concerned, the forlot Delegation hod ooHYineingly proved la tho oeurse of earlier diovaasions that tho LjpEtflftjNWftto the JL~3$ saesSBfc vest beyond tho teanedy^khrushehev iMteor said he visaed to appeal once again that the framuerk «TUO/ oslktaio fjf frht m /be exceeded and that tho area of dlsagreeBent KOzxktt not bo artiflaially onlaned. xaraon la eny event, he ooold not soy anything nor nov concerning tho ZL-16 issue.
The UBSB hod icaoicd vhat the IB eonsldered to be offensive veepens sal thus had fulfilled its nasal Tieenl it vas nov for tho xm to toko appropriate stops.
The UNI had fulfilled its ooasdveoats ; It had roaoie l lto alssiles and had proTided for verification by agreciag ***iy* tf 1*&i Mm* *ijj that feet. ■'• *eT*M*** 'fet'fsMtion of varbeads, Mr Kuxnetsov said this matter bed bee* discussed in detail at the last meeting.
Be did art mlsk/te dvoll on it, but vished to stress that the United States appreech to this question vu «<»h at complicating the problem sod ereeting artificial difficulties.
Be vlehcd to state that the tfBSfi l of missiles, vhich the UB called offensive veepons, asast that no varbeads related to malax iah veapena vould tcbbHii on Cuban •oil.
Therefore, any discueaion about eoae verification vas jn tulle— fiend could only protract the problem end divert our attention.
Ambassador ""* Stevenson had said that missiles vihhcut vsrhemds eould net be called veepons, but by the same token varheads vithout aisslles vere of no value either and could not be used, tt )er.
Kuxneteor said he viahed to stresa another point in order to maksNgggT step tcvard the solution of the problem end to clarify the eitustion.
Be said be vlshed to state that varheeds had been Leaded and reserved as soon as the denial cwf to remove missiles had been adopted.
As to s4s*«2*tyi§jB/lSBf|ping removed on the nine ships the list of vhich bed been f*n*|^ v~ ^^leMjs^j^laied that he now vished to go beak to the questions be **A raised la his initial remarks.
First ef all, he vented to stress again that the United States should pay attention to this problem also.
So far the USSR bad ©beerred a lack of Interest for this question on the part of the United States; indeed, the United States had tried to avoid the subject.
Perhaps Castro's language vas undesirable to the US, but it did reflect the legitimate demands of ths Cuban people.
Ba wondered vhat Rr» Jaatlap^ ' thought vaa unacceptable -toataaw It vaa neoeeeary ta kaev thia beete** it tha USSI hoard tha United States -riava on thia point it veeld obtain a^eaeer*plrt«re of tha ■ituation.
In any event, xtak tha Soviet Tieve expreeaed earliar vara in aooord vith tha agreentnt and nov it vaa lspoortact to diacuaa tha aubatanca of tha natter.
In thia ooanaetion, ha vlahad to aay to Mr Stevenson that vhila tht Soviet Delegation had oxpre aeed aoaa riava on thia setter, tha Ui had a hotter ldoa of how thii ilnoiojont should bo verded.
Th arefei it veuld ba useful if the United States danralopod rash a deeueent and gave it to tha toriot Salagation eofea* ve PatfsSpfljf JS*f^gej^ej »tood with regard to thia problem.
Hftnai/thl t j s jHn i of Sorlat ftntwi for tha fatura, Mr Cssaataor ■:,. .. -■■■r.~^r..ra*4*lto*fc «a»llani*at ha had asstlonad la fala initial raaarks aowarad thla UJ/ aattar, bacausaHi praaaooa vould oot only prorida far aaaauras assuring that thara vould ha ao thraat to Cuba, but Cuba vould alao undertaka oartaln eoaadtaefits not to bacons a threat to tha TJB. fbn USSR balirrad that Cuba vaa ao throat aran nov, but if tha United States dsalrad suah guarasteaa, tha USSR thought that Cuba ahould aatar into iom eaasltaatirta.

Ba thought that tha two iidaa had already dene a graat daal together; aaxqr anflilana had already been resolved aad If tha tap alas aldaa swiMnwil In tha sane spirit, thla natter could ba resolved too.

Incidentally, Koseov had reeaivad information that U8 halisjajpagf* V«f* already flying orer acaa Boriat abipa.
Vltb regard to bombers, va had dieeueeed this questlan in great detail tba other night.
Ba had given fiva citations to prove that tba United States had alvays regarded tboae aircraft as M^^ngl^e ^» the category ef offensive veapons, baglaaiag vltb a quotation from tba Preeident'e October £2 speech aad ending vltb tba Kannedy-KhruahabeT letters ef agreement.

Ha said he vlabed to atate that the question vas net ef Cuba but that ef canpllanee vltb the agreement, lot to remove the H>2£ aircraft/ vas act/ to comply vltb tba agreement.
Turning ta varbaads, Ambassador Stevenson cts said that tba U8 did net vlsb te daisy agreement by raising that myax paint; In fact, ve granted te ©onelude C agreement 10 days age.
It could not p er form on this point, so tha U8 had agreed te Inspection at sea^— so vhy could net such Inspection he applied te varhaads as vail, vhlch vere a ecaponent of rockets.
Kuznetsov's remark thatriOB had shavn no Interest in and had avoided the question ef guarantees.
He said he believed the United States had made Its position crystal-clear, and that position vas stated in the President's latter.
In any event, Ambassador Stevenson stressed, he believed that before one eould speak eeTvnat should be done upon completion of the transaction, agreement should be reached on the transaction itself.
Ha then said bo had. also notleed the* Mr Xaxnotaer had ohoeen his wrti rtrj carefully ""when he »■♦■ ■ »^rf 1^14 that varheada had Tro on renoved.
Mr Kuaneteor eeemed to ezelude thoee varheada net related to tho veapons reooYed.
Tho topH cation that othor nuclear warheads remained in Cuba vaa extrenely die<iuietlng, and perhepa tho USSR Mold &y atomo* t* all nucloar varheada had boon renoTed.
Mr Kuxnotaor rocallod tabaseador Btevonecn'a r e fer ence to *<■ J*.»lWlJ•floe ether deeueente to prove that tho ZL-16 aireraft had always eiW*Sitaailet.'ty tho United States aa offanalra weapons, and aald that ho wished to ropoat that Aahaseador Stereneen'a lattora and tho othor dottaaente ho had roforrod to vara unllatoral locuaentej Ikey thoao dceunente unilaterally llatod so-«alled offenaive weapons but thoy oould not bo recognised aa being in accord with tho Kennedy-CirueheheT agreeaent.

If vo vara no* to engage In a dlaousalon of those questions vfaleh had boon ralaod In tho course of polemic a, then there would bo no pregreea, vo vould not bo able to reooh agreement, and vo vould go back to tho eltuation of crlaia.
Both aides ahould handle vlth great care vhat had been agreed aa baala far thoao dellboratlooa. %e-»S2fcBBjes, Mr Koxneteor said he wished to state most emphatically tha* Mr, MKlay's fcrterpretation of his mrki vu incorrect.
For the sake of clarity, Mr Kusnetsov said, ha vlahad to repeat what ha had said, namely, that remoTal from Cuba of alatilas which tha United States resided as offensive weapons meant that no warheads relatinf to those weapons would ism In in Cuba.
Since this was so, any discussion about verification was now pointlass.
Whan Mr MoCloy implied that soeethine; slsa mi*ht be prasant in Cuba, that vas Incorrect.
Be also wished to stress that varhece¥^M>eem, ... loadad on ships and rsacrad as soon as tha decision had bean adopted, W raoewej the so-called offansiTe missiles.
Ibarefore, he wanted to repeat tfcet amy ;.-■••. discussion of control would be pointless.
The USSR oould only i discussions as an attempt to prevent the normalisation of the situation and to delay the settlement of the problem b7 creatine new obstacles in the vay of a possible ■triement.
SteTaneon's remark that the U83t eould not perform vlth respect to ground inspection, Mr Kuanetsor said that tha UBSft* *» response to a United States suaestlofi, bad made it poesible for the United States to obtain assurances vlth tajplfetfct jejM&e* «H rockets.
Mr Steressea vas aware af the situation *t*L*mmJf+k'00mt Inayectioa, and Mr Khrushchev's letter Meant, of course, tiMmieTlMJje*ilaM'^li£d be subject to consent from the Cuban Government.
M*. taanetser then said that he wished to come back to the question he intended to discuss today and which the OS side was tryimf to avoid.
The U88t had already considered this question sad it had been referred to in Mr Khrushchev • ■ lattar.
The USSJt had given assurances and had takaa certain steps, lovmr, If one traced down tha aala aoopoa of conflict, oca would aaa that it was not tha USSB but tha United States that had baas was responsible for what had happened la Cuba.
Tha vail country of Cuba mx threatened by a big country which had wantad to put aa and to tha reels* oat Cuban prevailing in Cuba and to prevent the/people fro* livlag as they pleased.
A •"" f *• the United States could not agree with the situation now obtaining la Cuba.
In Udr connection, he wished to draw attention to Mr Theodore Soransoa's Boveaber * stataaant on Tf, in which he had said that the United States could not aad would not give assurances with regard to non-invaalon until it was satisfied that soae agraeaant satisfactory to it was raaehad.
Ihe Soviet Union believed that sueh agreeawnt already existed and was contained la the Kannady-Xhrushchar letters.
At any rate, la vlev of the fact that views lika Mr Soraason's ware being proaoted In tha US, the jmpt believed Itaaoessary to discuss the question of United States guarantees to Cuba.
Mr Kusnetsov then euoted at length froa Bortioes' October 8 gpaach at tha M, tha TD« nagasinc^ April 26, 1961 eeeW about tha Bay of Pigs episode, and tha Septeaber 9, 196s Joint Baselution of Congress, saying that all tavtHesM proved United States aggressive intentions against Cuba.
It vas f or this rvuea tfcatftfct USSI conaidarad it iaposiible to ignora tht very important questioa esVl and assurances to ba given to Cuba.
Zt vas for this reason that th*| it important to have clear-cut assurances by tha 08 vith regard to nan-laWfvreaee and non-intervention in Cuba.
It vas important to hara a olaar ansvar vbathar tha OS waa prepared to give such assurances, from tht discussion Mr Stevenson had had vith Mr Ittkp Mikoyea, tha UB8X had gained tha impression that tha United States waa prepared ta give guarantaaa and to present thaa to tha Security Council.
V.. , :""-V s*a±±mem laaatad In tha 08 and soma latin American countries ralatad to this problem, Includin g Cuba.
Baa function of tha teams vould ba to obsarre compliance by tha partlas vith tha obligation* undertaken. ,:' .. f J>N/ .r <|lWlii r Ha wl mi l l that he realised he bad takaa aueh Una, but then tal* jMfclJSi ISis V JeT*» ant.
He would be appreciate as answer froa the 03, but if the WpBelegatlcn vaa not prep ar ed to give It nov, parbapa it could do ao later, If poaaible toaorrov.
Steveneon notad tha lateness of tha hour and aald ba wished to Bake a brlaf reply.
The \ ' ' ' "" to verify the removal of missiles, and it had suggested removal of warheads but that bad apparently been rejected.
Likewise, the U3SX apparently had rejected the reaoval of the IL-28 aircraft and naiclear bombs.
The trouble was that aa tha two sides ware unable to agree on the terms of the transaction, and Castro's objections apparently prevented the completion of the transaction.
Yost and himself would be aisMrtrfi available for further discussions if such discussions would prows fruitful.
