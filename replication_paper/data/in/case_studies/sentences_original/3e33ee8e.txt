Castro will be joined by Cuban Vice President Jose Ramon Fernandez at the conference where Cuban documents from the period will be declassified.
The crisis began on Oct., when a United States Air Force U-2 reconnaissance aircraft revealed the presence of several SS-4 missiles in Cuba.
It ended on Oct., when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceded to President John F Kennedys demands ordering all Soviet supply ships out of Cuban waters and removal of missiles from the island.
The world breathed a sigh of relief as leaders on both sides opted for reason rather than retaliation in resolving the crisis.
In addition to McNamara, other key figures in the Kennedy administration attending the conference include Theodore Sorensen, former special assistant to President Kennedy, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy aide.
Representing Russia at the conference are Sergei Khrushchev, son of the former Soviet premier; Sergo Mikoyan, son of deputy premier Anastas Mikoyan; retired Gen.
Anatoli Gribkov, a former commander of the Warsaw Pact who was involved in planning portions of the missile deployment; and Georgy Markovich Komienko, former Soviet attaché in Washington during the crisis.
