The crisis occurred during a tense 13-day standoff between the superpowers, regarding their deployment of nuclear missiles within close proximity of each other.
The U.S.A’s missile installations in Turkey and Italy prompted the U.S.S.R, to deploy their missiles to Cuba as a retaliation.
It can be argued that the deployment of nuclear weapons from both sides was to deter each other from any potential attack.
However, it is possible to argue that a peaceful outcome was not the motivator behind the deployments.
Only when the situation escalated to the threat of ‘mutually assured destruction’ did “President John F Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev … prevent..” nuclear war.
Had Khrushchev and Kennedy been intent on using military force, they would not have engaged in communications.
The aftermath of the crisis saw both states establish the Moscow-Washington nuclear hotline, improving mutual communication.
Before the crisis, neither side appeared willing to communicate with the other on issues like nuclear missile deployments.
Only when it became clear that neither side could emerge victoriously did a desire for peace emerge.
Hence, it appears that a crisis and consequent communications between leaders was needed to avert a nuclear war, as opposed to the fact of the existence of nuclear weapons.
Therefore, the suggestion peace is guaranteed because nuclear weapons promote stability and peace is undermined.
