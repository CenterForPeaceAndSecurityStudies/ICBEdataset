But almost all of the work has focused on the geopolitics of the crisis, on what went on in the Kremlin and the White House, and on each side's diplomatic and military moves and countermoves.
This article examines how the United States people experienced the crisis, how public opinion changed because of the events, and how the United States public views the Cuban missile crisis in retrospect.
The research was supported by the John F Kennedy Presidential Library Association.
From after Fidel Castro's overthrow o 1959 until 1961, typically less than 5 percent of the pub to be the ""most important problem"" facing the country in the immediate aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion o 9 percent of the public mentioned Cuba as the country's problem.
After that small peak concern steadily subside 1962, less than 2 percent of mentions dealt with Cuba.
In late August there were a series by exile groups and increasing news reports on the Sovi in Cuba.
On September 4, President Kennedy revealed the to-air antiaircraft missiles in Cuba and warned the Soviet offensive weapons in Cuba.
The president again spoke Cuba situation on September 13, and on September 20 th resolution authorizing the use of force to counter a Sovie Cuba.
AWARENESS OF THE CRISIS In response to these developments, Cuba became a people.
Then, on October 22, Presi the nation, announcing that the Soviet Union had inst missiles in Cuba and demanding their withdrawal.
He in States would enforce a blockade of offensive weap missiles were removed.
A Gallup poll in the field f showed that concern over Cuba remained high at 25 p than in late September.
Of the 1,126 people in these two com viewed between October 27 and November 4.
A Kennedy ended the blockade on Nove of the settlement, but before the cri over Cuba stood at 31 percent.
By September 1963, only 3 portant problem, and only once in the mention it.
Moreover, the most important problem figures for Cuba alone understate the extent of the public's concern over the confrontation.
All mentions of foreign affairs more than doubled from a relatively low level of 35 percent in August 1962 to a near-record high of 72 percent in November 1962.
Even during the peak of the Vietnam War, mentions of foreign problems only reached 58 percent.
Many of the non-Cuban foreign-affairs issues mentioned were tied to the missile crisis.
Only 7 percent mentioned unrelated foreign policy matters such as Berlin and China.
The Cold War From the end of World War II until the fall of communism in the late the Cold War rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States inated international relations.
Two of the main issues during this long c were whether the Cold War would turn hot and erupt into a nuclear War III and who was winning the Cold War.
In general, it was high during the Ko percent fearing another world war within 5 years (tabl to just 19 percent expecting a war within 5 years in incident, the Berlin crises of the early 1960s, and oth back up to 53 percent in September 1961.
In minds of 28 percen crisis 65 percent ha But even during an war was far from ""the chances of war between the United States and Russia"" had decreased ""because of the Cuba situation,"" with only 28 percent saying that it ha increased.
Likewise, only 24 percent thought that a world war would occur within 5 years.
This was also one of the lowest levels in the 1950s and 1960s, and the 5 percent who thought war would not happen was the highest during this period.
Thus, the outcome of the missile crisis was a lower fear of nuclear war.
Moreover, while the public was concerned about nuclear war, it was not overwhelmed by this fear.
Thus, while war was in early 1963 the public's number two concern among items on the list, less than a quarter saw it as the top problem, and almost no one saw fallout shelters as the most pressing issue.
People sa victory and as an advantage that they ex John F Kennedy PRESIDENTIAL JOB APPROVAL Of all post-World War II presidents, Kennedy rank During his term in office, he had a higher average any other president.

In the spring of 1963, 6-7 percent sup military action, 6 percent wanted to ""get Russian troops, missiles, etc. o Cuba,"" and 1-2 percent favored getting rid of Castro.
Sentiment did shift as United States policy in response to the disclosure of offe missiles changed.
In September 1962, 22 percent wanted the United St to ""keep out, hands off,"" and 25 percent did not know what action shou taken toward Cuba.
Only 3 percent still endorsed a hands-off policy, and uncerta dropped to 17 percent.
While the questions asked in the four surveys from September 1962 to May 1963 identical, different open-ended codings used hamper comparisons.
A special Gallup poll ta the nation found that 84 percent approved disapproved, and 12 percent ""withheld 1962).5 Overall, during Kennedy's presidency, the public consistently rejected invading Cuba and instead favored less extreme measures.
Immediately after the Bay of Pigs invasion, 70 percent supported working with Latin American countries and the United Nations, 63 percent backed a trade embargo, 44 percent supported aiding anti-Castro groups with money and military supplies, and just 24 percent endorsed the United States military overthrowing Castro.
