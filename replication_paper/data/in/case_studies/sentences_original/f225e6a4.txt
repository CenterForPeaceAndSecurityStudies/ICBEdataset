The episode is widely regarded as the closest the world has come to nuclear war, and it was certainly the most dramatic standoff in the Cold War.
Fortunately, Washington and Moscow had the sense to recognize how matters could escalate dangerously out of control, with the result that a deal was made in which the missiles would be withdrawn in exchange for a United States pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret arrangement in which the United States government would remove comparable missiles from Turkey.
The aftermath saw bickering over the terms of the settlement, and strained Soviet-Cuban relations, alongside a more cordial climate of Soviet-American relations that brought arms control measures.
The confrontation is one of enduring fascination and drama, and, accordingly, it has generated a massive and still-growing literature, examining diplomacy and crisis management, secret intelligence, civil defense, command and control, international law, and even linguistic analysis of the talks within the White House.
Decades after the event, many aspects of the crisis remain contested, and knowledge still grows with new interpretative frameworks and with the continued release of official documents.
Greater openness from the United States government has meant that knowledge of the American dimension is by far the fullest, but the end of the Cold War brought greater access to Soviet documentation and generated oral history testimony from participants.
Unfortunately, Cuban documentation is practically nonexistent, although historians acknowledge that Cuba was an actor as well as acted upon.
Without the Cuban decision to accept the missiles, for example, a missile crisis would not have occurred.
Both books are engagingly written accounts that draw extensively on fresh sources.
Colman 2016 draws on documents from archives across the world to place the missile crisis in its wider international and chronological context.
The analysis in Garthoff 1989 is enriched by the author’s experience as an official providing guidance to the White House.
