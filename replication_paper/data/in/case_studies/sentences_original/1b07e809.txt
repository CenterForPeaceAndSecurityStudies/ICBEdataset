In the 25 years since Walters last interviewed him, Castro has lost a bit of his bravado and swagger — Castro said it's been 17 years since he's smoked his trademark Cohiba cigars.
But his commitment to a socialist system of government is as passionate as it was in 1956 when he launched his guerrilla war against the regime of Gen.
He became Cuba's leader in January 1959 and has been at the helm ever since.
He has no plans to step down, unless he is incapacitated by illness.Surprisingly little is known about the personal life of Fidel Castro.

The Elian Tug of WarFor many young Americans, the 1999-2000 custody battle over Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez was their first introduction to Cuba.
Gonzalez, then just 6 years old, was picked up off the coast of Florida after the boat in which his mother, stepfather and several others had escaped from Cuba capsized.Miami-based Cuban exiles rallied around the boy, who was taken in by relatives there.
The exile community joined with Elian's Miami relatives, who refused to allow United States immigration officials to return the boy to his father in Cuba.
Justice Department officials eventually raided the Miami home where Gonzalez was being cared for, and the boy was reunited with his father.Castro said the Elian Gonzalez saga improved Cubans' perceptions of Americans and bolstered his own good feelings towards the American people.
