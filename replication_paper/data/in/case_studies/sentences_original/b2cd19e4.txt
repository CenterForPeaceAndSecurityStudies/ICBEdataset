And we tell it by putting you inside the room where the president and his advisors were actually dealing with the crisis.
In the spring of 1962 Khrushchev decided to deploy a nuclear strike force in Cuba 90 miles away from the United States.
On the 14th of October planes with cameras flying over Cuba found evidence of the missile site construction.
For the next 13 days they tried to find a way to get those missiles out.
But also tapes that were secretly recorded by President Kennedy in the cabinet room while he was meeting with his advisors.
There’s really nothing to reveal why the president made, created those tapes.
Some historians say it’s because he wanted them as he prepared his memoirs but there’s really, we just don’t know.
We have the chairs that President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev sat in the one and only time they met officially, which was in Vienna in 1961.
There’s a document in the exhibit in which the president is announcing an air strike on the missile sites in Cuba.
It was never delivered but it was prepared at a time when the president was trying to decide which course of action to pursue.
We have a map that was used during the briefings and we have in Kennedy’s own hand where he marked where the missile site installations were.
And it just gives you an extra dose of reality about the humanity of these people.
I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless and provocative threat to world peace.
Ultimately it was resolved when Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles.
The United States pledged not to invade Cuba and secretly they promised that missiles that they had in Turkey would also be removed.
The last piece of the exhibit is the original signed Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Both nations started working toward agreement on limiting nuclear weapons.
And the two powers did sign the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963.
