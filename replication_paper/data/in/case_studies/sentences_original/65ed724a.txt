At the start of the 1960s Moscow had gained a new Communist ally in Fidel Castro, but the United States kept talking about invading Cuba.
President John F Kennedy knew about them by 16 October, but he did not go on television and warn the American public of the risk of nuclear war until the 22nd.
He then declared a naval blockade of Cuba, saying that he would stop Soviet ships carrying further missiles from reaching Cuba by force if necessary.
The crisis was officially over by 28 October, and everybody breathed a sigh of relief.
What almost nobody knew until very recently is that the crisis did not really end on 28 October.
Castro, Mikoyan, Kennedy, Khrushchev, and the Missiles of November"", reveals that it continued all the way through November.
United States intelligence was unaware that along with the SS-4s, the Soviet Union had also sent more than a hundred shorter-range ""tactical"" nuclear missiles to Cuba.
They weren't mentioned in the SovietUnited States agreement on withdrawing the SS-4s from Cuba, so technically Khrushchev had not promised to remove them.
Fidel Castro was in a rage about having been abandoned by his Soviet allies, so to mollify him, Khrushchev decided to let him keep the tactical missiles.
The second half of the crisis, invisible to Americans, was Mikoyan's month-long struggle to pry Castro's fingers off the hundred tactical nuclear missiles.
In the end, he only succeeded by telling Castro that an unpublished law forbade the transfer of Soviet nuclear weapons to a foreign country.
