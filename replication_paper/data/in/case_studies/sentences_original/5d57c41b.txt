The Cold War was a major event in which the United States and Soviet Union displayed their growth in technology and militaristic strategies.
There are many points of view on what the start of this possible nuclear disaster could have been.
With the Cold War in full stride, it is easy for one to believe that the USSR was pursuing Cuba in order to equalize themselves in case of a nuclear outbreak.
The excuse from Russia is that the United States had recently placed nuclear weapons in Turkey.
Though, it was already known to them that nuclear weapons were already placed in Japan.
After the United States failed to dethrone the Castro regime using the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev made a secret agreement with the Cuban premier Fidel Castro.
The plan was to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to prevent any attempted invasions.
From October 16th to October 28th, 1962, intense diplomatic and militaristic actions occurred in the United States.
The Soviet Union had transferred nuclear missiles to Cuba, a neighboring country to the United States.
