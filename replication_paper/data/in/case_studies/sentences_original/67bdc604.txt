Although there were millions of dollars being pumped in to Cuba, little of it met the ordinary people as Batista and his friends were corrupt.
He wanted to see that the people had rights and in 1959, after a three year revolution, Batista was overthrown and Castro was in power.
The first thing was to see that the old leaders of the government were punished for what they did to the ordinary people.
Castro took all the American businesses as he believed that they belonged to Cuba and its people.
He did however let the USA keep its naval base that was on the east of the island.
It meant that the Soviet Union was expanding into their sphere of influence, and although spies told him that there were no nuclear weapons on Cuba, he was unsure of what the USSR intended.
By this point, Cuba's sugar exports that once went to the USA had now changed direction and was sold to the USSR, who were only too happy to help.
In April 1961, Kennedy decided to take action against Cuba as a United States spy plane had recently taken photographs showing clear development of several nuclear missile bases.
Kennedy could not tolerate this any longer when these missiles where only twenty minuets away from Washington.
He flew over 1400 anti-Castro exiles who had fled to the USA into Cuba and they landed at the Bay of Pigs.
They were greeted with 20.000 Cuban troops who killed all 1400 within days.
To the USSR, this suggests that the USA didn't want to get directly involved with Cuba, so the USSR kept sending weapons and missiles to Cuba.
In May 1962, Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, made a public announcement stating that the USSR was supplying Cuba with arms, but he didn't admit to the nuclear weapons now on the island.
By July 1962, Cuba had the best well-equipped army in the whole of Latin-America.
