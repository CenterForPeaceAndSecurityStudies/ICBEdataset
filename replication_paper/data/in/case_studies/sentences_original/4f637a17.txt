On 15 May 2012, Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting aired an hour-long documentary based upon Jon's research called ????????? – Defoliated Island.
This was followed by a 90-minute program – The Scoop Special – aired by TV-Asahi on 20 May 2012.
He has written widely on Okinawan social issues for the Japanese and American press – a selection of which can be found here.
