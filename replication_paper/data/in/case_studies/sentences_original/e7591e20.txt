Many nuclear warheads were poised for launch in Cuba aimed at the United States.
Five times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, the missiles might have meant the end of humanity.
From the start the United States saw Castro's ways to be communist, but he denied all accusations.
The United States eventually saw through his act and cut off trade with Cuba on May 27, 1960.
That's when Nikita Khrushchev, the premier of the Soviet Union, stepped in.
Then the United States started training Cuban exiles to deploy a surprise attack on Cuba.
On April 17, 1961 the troops were moved into a bay known as the Bay of Pigs.
Khrushchev decided then to build missile bases and installations in Cuba so they would have the upper hand if the United States decided to retaliate against the Soviet Union.
The next morning President John F Kennedy was informed about the missiles during breakfast.
October 17, Kennedy met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrie Gromyko and said that the United States would not tolerate Soviet missiles in Cuba.
This alliance laid the ground for the missile stations in Cuba, and the Missile Crisis itself.
The Cuban missile crisis marked a point where both sides almost fought a nuclear war but then decided to draw back.
