With a shaking voice, President Raul Castro said on state television that his older brother died at 10:29m.
Carlos Rodriguez, 15, was sitting in Havana's Miramar neighborhood when he heard that Fidel Castro had died.
Fidel Castro Ruz was born August 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba's sugar country, where his Spanish-immigrant father worked first recruiting labor for United States sugar companies and later built up a prosperous plantation of his own.
Neighborhood ""revolutionary defense committees"" kept an eye on everyone.
Cuba's government announced that Castro's ashes would be interred on December 4 in the eastern city of Santiago that was a birthplace of his revolution.
That will follow more than a week of honors, including a nearly nationwide caravan retracing, in reverse, his tour from Santiago to Havana with the triumph of the revolution in 1959.
