I have studied attentively your considerations which were forwarded through our Ambassador in Washington in the evening of November 15.
I wish first of all to express satisfaction with regard to your statement that the United States is also interested in the achievement of a rapid progress in untying the Cuban knot.
By the way, you yourself refer not to direct obligations of the sides but to the understanding implied by the American side in the expression âoffensive weaponsâ mentioned in the messages and in this connection you recall your TV address of October 22 and your proclamation of October 23.
Kuznetsovâs report on his talk with A Stevenson from which I learned that the American side is going to give us a draft of its document stating the US commitments of non-invasion of Cuba.
Our draft of the document on settling the conflict has been already forwarded to your representatives.
Well, I think, this answer of mine gives you not a bad material for your statement at your press-conference.
However, I hope, Mr President, that your statement will not be one-sided but will respond to mutual understanding of the situation with regard to immediate steps to remove the quarantine and to discontinue the flights of American planes over Cuba as well as with regard to the immediate formalizing through the UN of the commitments of the sides on the final liquidation of the crisis evolved in the Caribbean area.
