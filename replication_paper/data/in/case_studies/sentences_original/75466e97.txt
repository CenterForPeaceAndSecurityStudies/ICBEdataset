The weights depict the calendar month of October, with the 13 days spanning the crisis – Oct. to 28 – embossed in dark black.
Laura Diachenko, a public affairs specialist at the National Archives, said the exhibit featured some never-before-displayed items taken from the John F Kennedy Presidential Library.
Stacey Bredhoff, curator at the Kennedy Library, helped assemble the exhibit.
She said the taped conversations were some of the most interesting pieces.
The conversations reveal the technological hurdles Kennedy and Khrushchev had to overcome when negotiating and how miscommunications brought both countries to the brink of nuclear war.
He said the taped conversations among staff members were the most interesting part of the exhibit for him.
Hanson's friend Mike Stringfellow, 60, who is a writer at the Department of the Army in Huntsville, said the exhibit helped him see the complexity of the crisis.
Stringfellow was 10 years old in October 1962 and only vaguely remembers people talking about the crisis.
Stringfellow does remember the duck-and-cover drills that United States schools often practiced at the height of the Cold War, when schoolchildren would be instructed by their teachers to hide under their desks for protection.
Bredhoff visited the exhibit on opening day to see how visitors would respond.
The crisis also sped the development of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963.
