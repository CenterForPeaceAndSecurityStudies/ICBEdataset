Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest ranking intelligence official ever to have defected from the Soviet bloc.
In 1989, Romania's president Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed at the end of a trial where most of the accusations had come word-for-word out of Pacepa's book, Red Horizons, republished in 27 countries.
Mr Pacepa, you had direct knowledge of the KGBs ties to Oswald and you also have had access to newly disclosed KGB documents.
Tell us a bit about your own personal expertise in terms of this subject and the recently declassified evidence you have seen.
Moscow, of course, admitted nothing to us, the leaders of the Soviets surrogate intelligence services, about any involvement in the Kennedy assassination.
But for 15 years of my other life at the top of the Soviet bloc intelligence community, I was involved in a world-wide disinformation effort aimed at diverting attention away from the KGBs involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, the American Marine who had defected to Moscow, returned to the U.S., and killed President Kennedy.
We launched rumors, published articles and even produced books insinuating that the culprits were in the U.S., not in the Soviet Union.
Our ultimate proof was a note addressed to Mr Hunt, dated November 8, 1963 and signed by Oswald, copies of which turned up in the United States in 1975.
We knew the note was faked, but American graphological experts certified that it was genuine, and conspiracy theorists connected it to the CIAs E Howard Hunt, by then well known from the Watergate affair, and used it to prove that the CIA was implicated in the Kennedy assassination.
Original KGB documents in the Mitrokhin Archive, brought to light in the 1990s, finally proved that the note was forged by the KGB during the Watergate scandal.
The forged note was twice checked for authenticity by the KGBs Technical Operations Directorate and approved for use.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, I hoped the new leaders in Moscow might reveal the KGB hand in the Kennedy assassination.
In the 1990s, retired KGB officer Vasily Mitrokhin, helped by the British MI6, smuggled ca 25,000 pages of highly confidential KGB documents out of Moscow.
Nevertheless, the FBI described the Mitrokhin Archive as the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source.
The books author, Joachim Joesten, a German-born American communist, spent five days in Dallas after the assassination, then went to Europe and disappeared from sight.
A few months later Joestens book was published by American communist Carlo Aldo Marzani , who received $80,000 from the KGB to produce pro-Soviet books, plus an annual $10,000 to advertise them aggressively.
Other documents in the Mitrokhin Archive identify the first American reviewer of this book, Victor Perlo, as an undercover KGB operative.
In 1966 Lane published the bestseller Rush to Judgment, alleging that Kennedy was killed by a right-wing American group.
These two books encouraged people with any remotely related background expertise to join the fray.
Each viewed events from his own perspective, but all accused elements in the United States of that crime.
New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison looked around his home district and in 1967 arrested a local man, whom he accused of conspiring with elements of United States intelligence to murder Kennedy in order to stop the latter's efforts to end the Cold War.
According to another document, in April 1977 KGB chairman Yury Andropov informed the Politburo that the KGB was launching a new desinformatsiya campaign to further implicate American special services in the Kennedy assassination.
Unfortunately, the Mitrokhin Archive is silent on the subject after that.
You have discovered documents personally written by the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, suggesting that he was linked to the KGBs department for assassination abroad, and that he had returned to the United States from the Soviet Union only temporarily, on a mission.
Two federal investigations and over 2,500 books have looked into the assassination, but no one has raised this matter.
The FBI recently told the United States Congress that only a native Arabic speaker could catch the fine points of an al-Qaida telephone interceptespecially one containing intelligence doubletalk.
In 1955, when I became a foreign intelligence officer, I was informed that from then on my name would be Mihai Podeanu, and Podeanu I remained until 1978, when I broke with communism.
All my subordinatesand the rest of the Soviet bloc foreign intelligence officersused codes in their written reports, when talking with their sources, and even in conversations with their own colleagues.
When I left Romania for good, my espionage service was the university, the countrys leader was the Architect, Vienna was Videle, and so on.
In intelligence and counterintelligence only the man who is heading these services knows everything.
During my last ten years in Romania I also managed the country's equivalent of NSA, and I became familiar with the code systems used throughout the Soviet bloc intelligence community.
In them I found proof that Oswald was sent to the United States on a temporary mission, and that he planned to return to the inscrutable Soviet Union after accomplishing his task.
It took me many years to sift the wheat from the chaff in going through the piles of investigative reports generated by the violent death of the young American president, but when I finished I was fascinated by the wealth of KGB fingerprints all over the story of Oswald and his killer, Jack Ruby.
Lets take the handwritten note in Russian Oswald left his Soviet wife, Marina, just before he tried to kill American general Edwin Walker in a dry run before going on to assassinate President Kennedy.
He stresses that she should contact the embassy, that they have friends here, and that the Red Cross will help her financially.
It is noteworthy that Marina did not mention this note to United States authorities after Oswalds arrest.
It was found at the home of Ruth Paine, an American friend with whom Marina was staying at the time of the assassination.
But according to your book, Oswald secretly met an officer of the KGBs assassination department in Mexico City just a few weeks before shooting President Kennedy.
A tangible one is the letter he sent to the Soviet embassy in Washington a few days after meeting Comrade Kostin in Mexico City.
Elsewhere Oswald identified the person he had met there as Comrade Kostikov.
A handwritten draft of that letter was found among Oswalds effects after the assassination.
The previously mentioned Ruth Paine testified that Oswald re-wrote that letter several times before typing it on her typewriter.
A photocopy of the final letter Oswald sent to the Soviet embassy was recovered by the Warren Commission.
I was unable to remain in Mexico indefinily because of my mexican visa restrictions which was for 15 days only.
The fact that Oswald did not use his real name to obtain his Mexican visa confirms this conclusion.
Now lets juxtapose this combined letter against the free guide book Esta Semana-This Week, September 28  October 4, 1963, and a Spanish-English dictionary, both found among Oswalds effects.
The guide book has the Soviet embassys telephone number underlined, the names Kosten and Osvald noted in Cyrillic on the page listing Diplomats in Mexico, and check marks next to five movie theaters on the previous page.
Also marked on Oswalds map is the Palace of Fine Arts, a favorite place for tourists to assemble on Sunday mornings to watch the Ballet Folklórico.
Contrary to what Oswald claimed, he was not observed at the Soviet embassy at any time during his stay in Mexico City, although the CIA had surveillance cameras trained on the entrance to the embassy at that time.
In short, all of the above facts taken together suggest to me that Oswald resorted to an unscheduled or iron meetingzheleznaya yavka in Russianfor an urgent talk with Kostikov in Mexico City.
The iron meeting was a standard KGB procedure for emergency situations, iron meaning ironclad or invariable.
In my day I approved quite a few iron meetings in Mexico City , and Oswalds iron meeting looks to me like a typical one.
Of course, I cannot be sure that everything happened exactly that wayevery case officer had his own quirks.
On the following Tuesday, still in Mexico City, he telephoned the Soviet embassy from the Cuban embassy and asked the guard on duty to connect him with Comrade Kostikov with whom he had talked on September 28.
Every communist party was managed by a Soviet-style politburo, all Soviet bloc armies wore the same uniform, every East European police force was replaced by a Soviet-style militia.
Yes, Soviet intelligence, like the Soviet government in general, had a strong penchant for patterns.
By its very nature espionage is an arcane and duplicitous undertaking, but in the hands of the Soviets it developed into a whole philosophy, every aspect of which had its own set of tried and true rules and followed a prescribed pattern.
Oswalds experiences as a Marine serving in Japan, for instance, perfectly fit the PGU template for recruiting American servicemen outside the United States that I for many years had applied to Romanian operations.
It also was obvious that the locker at a bus terminal Oswald used in 1959, after returning to the United States from Japan, to deposit a duffel bag stuffed with photographs of United States military planes was in fact an intelligence dead drop.
Soviet espionage operations can be isolated out by their patterns, if you are familiar with them.
Counterintelligence experts call these patterns operational evidence, showing the fingerprints of the perpetrator.
That was Soviet dezinformatsyiadisseminated by my DIE as well, at KGB behest.
As a radar operator at Atsugi Air Base in Japan, Oswald knew the flight altitude of the CIAs super-secret U-2 spy planes flying over the Soviet Union from that base.
In 1959, when I was chief of Romanias intelligence station in West Germany, a Soviet requirement sent to me asked for everything, including rumors, about the flight altitude of the U-2 planes.
The Soviet Defense Ministry knew that U-2 planes had flown over the Soviet Union several times, but its Air Defense Command had not been able to track them because the Soviet radars of those days did not reach ultra-high altitudes.
Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot whom the Soviets shot down on May 1, 1960, believed that the Soviets were able to get him because Oswald had provided them with the altitude of his flight.
According to Powers statement, Oswald had access not only to radar and radio codes but also to the new MPS-16 height-finding radar gear and the height at which the U-2 flew, which was one of the most highly classified secrets.
It seems that Oswald, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, was one of the people in the audience attending Powerss spectacular trial in Moscow.
He seemed to be a nice, bright american-type fellow, when I saw him in Moscow.
Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected to the United States in 1964, told assassination researcher Gerald Posner: I am surprised that such a big deal is made of the fact that was a Marine.
But he belonged to a KGB domestic department and knew nothing about PGU foreign sourcesjust as a middle level FBI agent would know nothing about CIA sources abroad.
Recruiting low-ranking American servicemen was one of the PGUs highest priorities in those days.
Hunting for a serzhant was my top priority during the three years I was assigned as rezident in West Germany, and it was still a top priority in 1978, when I broke with Communism.
Of course the PGU would have liked to recruit American colonels, but they were difficult to approach, whereas low-ranking officers were more accessible and could provide excellent information if given the right guidance.
In the 1950s he was stationed abroad where, like Oswald, he became infatuated with communism.
In 1953 Johnson surreptitiously entered a Soviet military unit in East Berlin, where he askedas Oswald evidently didto be granted political asylum in the workers paradise.
Johnson was secretly awarded the rank of Red Army major and received written congratulations from Khrushchev himself.
Vitaly Yurchenko, who defected to the CIA in 1985 and soon redefected, United States Chief Warrant Officer John Anthony Walkeranother serzhantwas the greatest agent in PGU history, surpassing in importance even the Soviet theft of the Anglo-American blueprints for the first atomic bomb.
In 1962, when Oswald returned from the Soviet Union, he brought with him a 13-page document entitled Historic Diary.
The term was introduced by General Aleksandr Sakharovsky, a former Soviet chief adviser to Romanias Securitate who rose to head the PGU for an unprecedented fourteen years.
The Securitate had the historic task to weed out the bourgeoisie from the Romanian soil, as he constantly preached at us.
The historic duty of the PGU was to dig the grave of the international bourgeoisie.
Dogonyat i peregonyat was our monumentalnaya, historic task, he told us right after Khrushchev had launched that famous slogan of his about catching up with the West and overtaking it in the space of ten years.
All our illegal officers and agents sent to the West under a fictitious biography had to take along some kind of written memory aid, so that they could remember exactly where they had supposedly been when, and what they had done in various periods of their alleged lives.
Up to the end of the 1950s, these notes had been taken abroad in the form of microdots or on soft film concealed in some everyday object, but of course they presented the potential risk of becoming incriminating evidence if ever found.
In January 1959 Sakharovsky ordered all Soviet bloc foreign intelligence services to conceal those biographies in the form of diaries, drafts of books, personal letters or autobiographical notes.
These notes were drafted by disinformation specialists, copied out by hand by the illegal or intelligence agent concerned, usually just before leaving for the West, and then carried across the border openly.
A microscopic examination of Oswalds Historic Diary did indeed show that it was written in one or two sessions.
In the end, you find that the evidence suggests that Oswald lost PGU support, and that he went alone to kill President Kennedy.
In October 1962, the West German Supreme Court mounted a public trial of Bogdan Stashinsky, a Soviet intelligence defector who had been decorated by Khrushchev for having assassinated enemies of the Soviet Union living in the West.
This trial revealed Khrushchev to the world as a callous political butcher.
By 1963 the once flamboyant Soviet dictator was already a crippled ruler gasping for air.
The slightest whiff of any Soviet involvement in the assassination of the American president could have been fatal to Khrushchev.
Thus, the KGBas did my DIEcanceled all operations aimed at assassinating enemies in the West.
The available documents show that, to prove to the PGU that he was capable of securely carrying out the assigned assassination, Oswald conducted a dry run by shooting atalthough narrowly missingAmerican general Edwin Walker.
Oswald put together a package, complete with photographs, showing how he had planned this operation, and then he took this material to Mexico City to show Comrade Kostin, his case officer, what he could do.
Even though he had pulled off the Walker assassination attempt without being identified as the perpetrator, Moscow remained adamant.
The stubborn Oswald was devastated, but in the end he went ahead on his own, utterly convinced he was fulfilling his historic task.
He was just 24 years old, and he had done his best to obtain weapons in an inconspicuous way and to fabricate identity documents, using the tradecraft the KGB had taught him.
Up until the very end he also followed the emergency instructions he had originally been given by the KGBadmit nothing and ask for a lawyer.
Since Oswald already knew too much about the original plan, however, Moscow arranged for him to be silenced forever, if he should go on to commit the unthinkable.
Seven chiefs of the Soviet political police itself were secretly or openly assassinated to prevent them from incriminating the Kremlin.
Furthermore, immediately upon news of Kennedys assassination Moscow launched Operation Dragon, a disinformation effort in which my service was deeply involved.
The aimwhich has succeeded only too wellwas to throw the blame on various elements in the United States for killing their own president.
A first review of Programmed to Kill, by Publishers Weekly, states that your book is based on old intelligence anecdotes and offers no convincing Soviet motives for the assassination.
But two years later Ceausescu was executed at the end of a trial whose accusations came almost word-for-word out of Red Horizonswhich is still in print.
Today, people remember him as a down-to-earth peasant who corrected the evils of Stalin.
The Khrushchev I knew was bloody, brash and extroverted, and he tended to destroy every project once he got his hands on it.
Khrushchevs irrationality made him the most controversial and unpredictable Soviet leader.
He unmasked Stalin's crimes, but he made political assassination a main instrument of his own foreign policy.
He authored a policy of peaceful coexistence with the West, but he ended up by pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war.
He concluded the first agreement for the control of nuclear arms, but he tried to secure Fidel Castro's position at the helm of Cuba with the help of nuclear arms.
He repaired Moscow's relations with Yugoslavia's Tito, but he broke those with Beijing and thereby destroyed the unity of the Communist world.
On September 11, 1971 Khrushchev died in ignominy, as a non-person, although not before seeing his memoirs published in the West giving his own version of history.
Gen Ion Mihai Pacepa, thank you kindly for joining Frontpage Interview.
Aside from the new revelations and important facts and questions you have brought to the forefront about the Kennedy assassination, your book serves as yet another reminder of the evil nature of the KGB and the truly dark and sinister entity that we faced in the Soviet regime.
I greatly appreciate your courage in being willing to debate this controversial subject.

The article did not seem clear on the Kremlin’s initial interest in killing Kennedy.
I can postulate that Krushchev felt angry after the Missile Crisis, and that that was sufficient reason.
But after the Missile Crisis, Krushchev was on a fairly short leash, Breshnev being ascendant, among others.
They had far less at stake with respect to Kennedy, and would presumably have known about such goings on — and possibly been responsible for authorizing or countermanding such plans.
Childs was in Moscow during November 1963 and overheard conversations concerning Kennedy’s death.

All The JFK Assassination conspiracy was born out of the missing facts.
It takes a Perry Mason type to figure out the creditable evidence and disinformation.
Free ThinkerNY I don’t think Oswald was a “Manchurian Candidate” type agent.
Pelham The Soviets were as curious about who could have killed Kennedy as we were.
Kerry's family history of opium running into China probably plays a role in this also.
Consider the number of persons only remotely connected to the assassination who were dead, many under curious circumstances by 1966.
Gerald Ford was on the Warren Commission, as was sitting senator, Arlen Specter.
