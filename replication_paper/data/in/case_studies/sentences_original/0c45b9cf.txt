The President opened the meeting by asking Secretary Rusk to read the attached message from Prime Minister Macmillan which had just been received.
Secretary Rusk observed that for a first reaction to information of our proposed blockade it was not bad.
The President commented that the Prime Minister's message contained the best argument for taking no action.
He added that we have a report of a fleet of Soviet submarines which are in a position to reach Cuba in about a week.
We must reply to those whose reaction to the blockade would be to ask what had changed in view of the fact that we had been living in the past years under a threat of a missile nuclear attack by the USSR. a.
We have to carry out commitments which we had made publicly at that time. b.
The secret deployment by the Russians of strategic missiles to Cuba was such a complete change in their previous policy of not deploying such missiles outside the USSR that if we took no action in this case, we would convey to the Russians an impression that we would never act, no matter what they did anywhere. c.
Therefore, if they acted now in response to our blockade action, we would only have brought on their Berlin squeeze earlier than expected. d.
In response to a Presidential question, Secretary McNamara said that an information group was working on the problem of voluntary press censorship based on experience during the Korean War. [1 paragraph not declassified] Secretary McNamara reported that the Defense Department was working on how we would prevent the introduction into Cuba of nuclear weapons by airplanes.
