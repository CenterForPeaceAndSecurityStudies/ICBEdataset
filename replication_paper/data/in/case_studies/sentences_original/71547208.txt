The intelligence represented by this map was supplied by U-2 spy planes, confirming President Kennedy's worst fears of an increasing Soviet military presence just one hundred miles away from the American coast.
A two-page key paperclipped to the upper right corner, headed ""MRBM-IRBM Status of Cuban Missiles,"" dated October 27, 1962, summarizes the Soviet military buildup, listing sites, enumerating number of launchers and missiles, and completion status.
During a meeting at his office, McNamara described for me the pressure President John Kennedy was under from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to order an attack on Soviet targets in Cuba.
McNamara said the president pored over this map before deciding to delay the attack.
The map shows the position of every Soviet missile, bomber and fighter jet and nuclear storage facility in Cuba as of noon on Saturday, October 27, 1962.
October 27 was the day the crisis came within hours, even minutes, of triggering a war between the United States and Soviet Union.
That morning, a Soviet anti-air missile shot down a U-2 spy plane on a photo reconnaissance mission over Cuba.
Many years later, the Cubans claimed Fidel Castro himself pushed the button to fire the missile.
Later that afternoon, two United States destroyers dropped depth charges on a Soviet submarine.
At last minute, the Soviet captain surfaced his submarine, his other option being to launch his missiles against the United States mainland.
When the sun set that evening, McNamara wondered if he'd be alive to see the following Saturday's sunset.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff pushed for an air strike against the Soviet missile sites and other targets.
Had Kennedy given the order, this map shows the nine Soviet targets United States warplanes would have bombed.
But overnight, everything changed.Relying on a letter from Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to President Kennedy, Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin hammered out a deal.
The Soviets agreed to withdraw their missiles and other offensive weapons in return for the United States pledging not to invade Cuba.
The United States secretly promised to remove obsolete missiles from Turkey.
The nine targets on the map became the weapons the United States forced out of Cuba.
This amazing map dates to the penultimate day of the crisis—October 27th, a day that saw an American pilot shot down over Cuba.
Had Kennedy given the order to attack, this map shows the nine Soviet targets that American fighters would have bombed.
Finally, a deal was brokered between Kennedy and Khrushchev in which the Soviets would dismantle their missiles and installations in Cuba, in exchange for United States removal of missiles from Turkey and a pledge to never invade Cuba.

Announcements and corrections from the podium at live auctions and those made through the Conditions of Sale appearing on the Internet at RRauction.com supersede those in the printed Catalog.\n\nBidder:\n\nBidder shall mean the original Bidder on the property offered for sale by RR Auction and not any subsequent owner or other person who may acquire or have acquired an interest therein.

All purchases delivered to Massachusetts are subject to applicable Massachusetts sales tax unless the purchaser possesses a Massachusetts sales tax exemption number.\n\nBidding:\n\nEach Bidder's determination of its bid should be based upon its own examination of the item, rather than the strict reliance as to what is represented in the Catalog, online or elsewhere.
In any purchase or sale, the value of the item is determined by the price.
A Bidder should make certain to bid on the correct lot and that the bid is the maximum that the Bidder is willing and able to pay.
Since other Bidders will be present, and since a re-offering could damage the momentum of the sale, once the hammer has fallen and RR Auction has announced the winning Bidder, such Bidder is unconditionally bound to pay for the lot, even if the Bidder has made a mistake.\n\nAll prospective Bidders who examine lots in person prior to the sale shall personally assume all responsibility for any damage they cause in so doing.
RR Auction shall have sole discretion in determining the value of the damage caused, which shall be promptly paid by the prospective Bidder.\n\nTitle to any lot remains with Consignor, any secured party of the Consignor, or assignee of Consignor, as the case may be, until the lot is paid for in full by Bidder.

RR Auction reserves the right to void an invoice if payment in full is not received within thirteen calendar days of the Auction or within twelve calendar days of the invoice date.
In cases of nonpayment, RR Auction's election to void a sale does not relieve the Bidder from their obligation to pay RR Auction its fees on the lot and any other damages pertaining to the lot.\n\nAll sales are strictly for cash in United States dollars , and are subject to all reporting requirements.\n\nAll deliveries are subject to good funds; funds being received in RR Auction's account before delivery of the Purchases; and all payments are subject to a clearing period.
