A considerable number of such books had already been written, of course, ranging from the very informative and humorous, such as Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe, to the not-so-informative or humorous, which I will not identify.
These questions are of interest to us all, or at least to all of us reading this particular book.
The twentieth century saw scientific fields becoming so complex that only a small number of specialists are able to master their techniques and the mathematics used to describe them.
And very few of these people have the time and inclination to write amusing books describing the highlights, not only of their own field, but also of other relevant fields.
In reading this book you will probably encounter some terms with which you are unfamiliar.
You will not be tested on these terms, but should wish to review them, feel free to use the extensive glossary at the end of the book.
Each of the fifty-three chapters in this book represents a significant event in the history of the universe.
The first page of each chapter lets you know where and when the event occurred.
Time points early in the history of the universe give the time elapsed since the Big Bang—these are usually written in scientific notation.
You can look at the glossary entry on “scientific notation” for more information on how to interpret these numbers.
I hope that you enjoy it, that you learn from it, and that you recommend it to friends, relatives, coworkers, acquaintances, bartenders, bus drivers, flight attendants, random passers-by, and pretty much anyone else you happen to meet.
Eric Schulman Alexandria, Virginia December 16, 1998 XIV 10^^ seconds after the Big Bang The Universe QUANTUM FLUCTUATION In Which Our Universe Begins nee upon a time, long ago and far away, there was a universe very much like our own.
It had dogs, and cats, and people (some of whom preferred the dogs and some of whom preferred the cats), and Trigoencephalopodic Gnoccis, and other things of which you've never 1 heard because we haven't encountered them yet.
Now it just so happened that one of the effects of quantum mechanics was that large amounts of matter and energy could spontaneously appear, even though this rarely happened in a given volume of space.
Well, on this particular once-upon-a-time, an entire universe appeared.
Its density was more than 1000 billion billion billion billion billion billion billion 3 billion billion billion times that of water and its temperature was more than 100,000 billion billion billion degrees Fahrenheit.
Luckily for the inhabitants of the first universe, the new universe quickly became detached from the old universe and started expanding into a completely different four-dimensional volume of space.
This is the story of that Universe, and of some of the things that have happened in it during the last 14 billion years. 10“^^ seconds after the Big Bang The Universe QUANTUM FLUCTUATION In Which the Grand Unified Force Separates into the Four Forces of Nature as We Now Know Them, and the Universe Expands to Many Times Its Original Size in a Very Short Period of Time “Welcome ladies and gentlemen to another beautiful diurnal period here at Universal Downs.
We're ready for the start of what should be a most exciting Cosmological Derby.
There are just four forces competing today, but each and every one of them is a champion in its own right.
All four forces are lined up and unified at the starting gate, waiting for the bell to announce the moment of the Big Bang, which will start this exciting race to determine which is the strongest force in the Universe.
While the fundamental particle physicists frown at the lack of precision in this explanation, the rest of us may continue on to the next chapter, which discusses parking places. 6 10“^^ seconds after the Big Bang The Universe EXPANSION In Which the Universe Continues to Expand, though not Quite as Quickiy The Universe is expanding, but for some reason it never gets any easier to find a parking place.
You would have to wait 65 million years for a one-mile block in the middle of space to expand enough to produce another parking space.
The other reason is that the gravitational attraction between all of the particles in the Earth completely overcomes the expansion of the Universe, so even if you circled a block on Earth for 65 million years it wouldn't get any bigger.
Taking public transportation would be a much more efficient use of your time.
In order to answer that question, let us imagine ourselves to be twodimensional creatures living on the surface of a balloon.
Only the mathematicians among us have any concept of up/down, and everyone else suspects that they are probably just making it up.
Eventually however, some two-dimensional astronomers discover 7 that the balloon is expanding.
However, these concepts are quite difficult for the two-dimensional inhabitants of balloonland.
But that would imply the Universe has a finite volumeastronomers call this type of universe “closed”-and will eventually stop expanding and begin to recollapse.
While this is possible, many astronomers now consider it to be unlikely.
It appears most likely that the Universe is infinite in extent-“open”-and will continue to expand forever, which implies that it is a three-dimensional hyperbolic paraboloid in four-dimensional space.
Think of it as the fourdimensional representation of a three-dimensional saddle.
Antiparticles are very much like particles, except that when particles and antiparticles meet they completely destroy each other and emit a burst of energetic radiation.
God saw that the light was good, and He separated the photons from the particles and antiparticles.
God called the photons “bosons” and the particles and antiparticles He called “fermions.And there was pair production and there was photon creation-the first 10'""^^ seconds.
So God made an exponential expansion of the Universe that separated the magnetic monopoles from each other so that all attempts to find one would be futile.
And there was vacuum energy density and there was 'j-y inflation-the first 10' seconds.
God made protons and neutrons combine to produce deuterium nuclei, and the deuterium nuclei He combined to make helium nuclei.
And there was also some lithium and there was also some beryllium-the first three minutes.
God blessed the partieles and said, “Be fruitful and produee neutral atoms,” and the radiation beeame less energetie and the eleetrons eombined with atomie nuelei.
And there was baekground radiation and there were neutral atoms-the first 380,000 years.
God made the elusters of galaxies aeeording to their kinds, and the galaxies aeeording to their kinds, and the stars aeeording to their kinds.
And there was violent relaxation and virialization-the first billion years.

LOCAL GROUP, 10 billion years B.C. —Another major galaxy formed today in the Local Group, a collection of about two dozen galaxies located on the outskirts of the large Virgo Cluster of Galaxies.
Whether life will develop within either of these galaxies is still an open question.
Globular clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars and orbit the new galaxy along elliptical paths.
The stars here are mostly hydrogen and helium so it is not expected that many planets will form, making it unlikely for life to arise around these stars.
As the pregalactic cloud began to collapse in earnest, the cloud's slight rotation became faster and faster and the stars and gas formed a disk.
It is expected that the intense star formation in this region of the new galaxy will result in large amounts of the elements needed to form planets and life.
The chances for life may be highest near the center of the galaxy, where the star formation is most intense.
However, it is possible that supernova explosions will sterilize planets that orbit stars close to the center of the galaxy.
The Galaxy TURBULENT FRAGMENTATION In Which a Giant Cloud of Gas Fragments into Smaller Clouds, Which Become Protostars a stellar nursery IF YOU’RE LIKE ME, YOU’VE PROBABLY LOOKED UP AT THE SKY COUNTLESS TIMES TO ADMIRE THE BEAUTIEUL STARRY NIGHT and wished you could have the same effect in your own home.
Because this month’s issue of Martha Stellar Living is devoted to learning how to make a star.
I love stars because they provide an opportunity to be so wonderfully creative with such simple ingredients.
That cloud of gas you probably have in your garden could be turned into an old standby such as a Sun-like yellow star.
And simply by adding a bit of mass you can easily produce a brilliant blue 17 supergiant.
Of course, a well-stocked pantry makes the preparation of stars much, much simpler.
Magnetic fields are most important and a good garden is an absolute must for providing the necessary elements.
My garden is modest, only a few cubic parsecs in size-about 100,000 billion billion billion billion billion cubic yards or so-but it provides me with all the hydrogen, helium, and trace elements necessary to make perfect stars every time.
To start, take a cloud with about ten thousand solar masses of material.
The cloud will be rotating, which is a problem because of course angular momentum is conserved.
This is often very troubling to novices since the traditional methods won't help here, but remember that flexibility is an important part of being a good and creative cook.
So instead of dealing with each part of the cloud individually, add a magnetic field to transfer some of the angular momentum from the entire cloud to the surrounding medium.
Don't rush this step-you need to wait a full million or even ten million years before proceeding if you want a perfect star.
Your cloud should now be relatively smooth, with just a few lumps here and there.
At this point, add some random motion to the mixture, and watch as this turbulence fragments it into smaller and smaller pieces.
The Galaxy MASSIVE STAR FORMATION In Which a Massive Star Is Formed stars in the making IN THE LAST ARTICLE I SHOWED YOU HOW TO TURN A GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD INTO SOME LOVELY PROTOSTARS, AND now it’s time to learn how to turn one of these into a perfect star.
As long as you keep it transparent the radiation will escape from the center and the temperature will be stable.
Remember that you can't get a perfect star if it is heated unevenly during formation, so never skimp on these details.
After a few thousand years, the central regions should become dense and begin to collapse faster than the rest.
The density and pressure should increase 20 until the central regions reach a temperature of about 3,140 degrees Fahrenheit, at which point the hydrogen molecules begin to break into hydrogen atoms, spurring further collapse until a temperature of about 53,540 degrees Fahrenheit is reached in the core.
This increase in core temperature should occur over a period of a few hundred thousand years-remember not to rush things-and the surface temperature will increase from -270 degrees Fahrenheit to a most satisfactory 4,940 degrees Fahrenheit.
At this point the time required for the next step depends greatly on the final mass you want the star to have.
Because I insist on offering only the very best to my guests, I usually make a massive star of about 15 solar masses.
And since such stars don't take as long to make, I can create more of them.
While a star the mass of the Sun would take 40 million years to complete the protostar phase, a 15 solar mass star needs only 60,000 years.
Of course, the more massive star will live for only 10 million years rather than 10 billion, but that can be an advantage since I like to redecorate fairly frequently.
Still, since less massive stars are cool, they are red, so I sometimes make a number of 21 low-mass stars just for a little variety in color.
Remember, the star clusters you create can be elaborate, elegant, and quite substantial at the same time.
Don't forget that the final mass of each star will depend somewhat on the environment of the proto star-be sure to prepare the region ahead of time so there will be no errors.
In the final stages, the core temperature increases to a few hundred thousand degrees Fahrenheit, the hydrogen is ionized, and then the star contracts to its final radius.
Once the core temperature is high enough , nuclear fusion commences, and a new star is born.
Remember that throughout this process, organization is of utmost importance.
Make sure that your ingredients are ready when they are needed-knowing when and where to add more material is absolutely essential for making a perfect star.
For example, if the star rotates too quickly, it could end up with an active surface, and it will not make for a lovely presentation.
I KNOW THAT BEFORE YOU SIGNED UP TO BE A MASSIVE STAR YOU READ THE FANCY BROCHURES THAT TALKED ABOUT HOW BRIGHTLY YOU'D BE SHINING AND HOW YOU'D BE VISIBLE FROM HALFWAY ACROSS THE Galaxy.
All three were busy fusing hydrogen to helium, but because their masses were not the same, they each went about it in a different way.
The little star shone only as brightly as it thought wise, and used up its hydrogen fuel very slowly.
The medium star used up its hydrogen in 10 billion years and then started fusing helium to carbon and oxygen.
But the helium only lasted a billion years, after which the medium star decided to be content with being a slowly cooling white dwarf.
Even though it had 25 times more hydrogen than the medium star, it used it up 1,400 times faster, and the hydrogen only lasted 7 million years.
Then the big star started fusing helium to carbon, but that only lasted half a million years.
It was left with a core of one and a half solar masses of iron at a temperature of 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit.
And unfortunately for the big star, the protons and neutrons in iron nuclei are so tightly bound together that iron fusion doesn't produce energy.
Now the big star felt as though 7 billion billion billion elephants were pressing down on its core, and the temperature rose even more until energetic photons completely disintegrated the iron nuclei.
The big star thought that 7 million years was a long time and that it didn't have to worry about such a distant future.
After the hydrogen was gone, it realized that such wasteful energy production may not have been the wisest course of action, but it was too late to do anything about it.
The Galaxy SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION In Which a Massive Star Ends Its Life by Expioding “Hum Parsec to Star Command, come in, Star Command.
According to my neutrino detector, silicon burning should be almost complete.
Even though individual neutrinos very rarely interact with matter, that many neutrinos could easily fry you.
The material has rebounded and is flying away from the center of the star.
I am safely away from the supernova and am now able to report on the effects it is having on the surrounding area.
Nearby clouds of hydrogen and helium gas are being compressed by the force of the explosion, and the heavy elements it created are being mixed with the clouds.
Some of these clouds are now dense enough to become protostars, but the amount of metals is probably too small to create planets.
My husband and I wanted a star with a big enough habitable zone that we could have life on at least one planet, but we didn't have a lot of resources to spend.
The stars would be emitting only 30 to 60 percent of the energy that a one solar mass star emits.
It was exactly 1. solar masses and there were nine planets forming around it, one of which was at a distance of 93 million miles from the star.
Stars produce more energy with time, so the location of the habitable zone changes, but we calculated that this planet would be habitable for at least six billion years, by which time we will have long since retired.
They found only 1 part per 10 billion of lead and no detectable radon in the star, which set our minds at ease.
After getting a loan for the necessary resources, we signed the final papers and the star system was ours.
The Earth PLANETARY DIFFERENTIATION In Which the Planet Earth Forms “Welcome back to the Planets Show on the Galactic Value Channel.
It's a terrestrial planet, which as you know is the number-one best-selling planetary type in our GVC collection.
The Earth and the other terrestrial planets are forming close to the sun out of kilometer-sized chunks of rock.
Because the temperature in the inner solar system is too high for ice to survive, the terrestrial planets have only about 10 percent of the planetesimals available to the outer planets, and therefore will not become massive enough to hold onto hydrogen and helium.
It will be a beautiful mixture of brown and blue, with about 70 percent of its surface covered by water.
You know, when I saw that it was on the schedule I heard the writing on the wall and just knew it would go fast.
I was especially impressed by the way in which molten iron will percolate down through the silicate mantle to produce a spinning metallic core.
I'm expecting an atmosphere to form from the emission of volatile gases 34 from volcanoes, as well as from comet impacts.
The cycle goes on For billions of years; watch as The Sun gets brighter.
The Earth MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION In Which Life on Earth Begins It was a dark and stormy night.
In the shallow tide pool, a nucleic acid base collided with a sugar molecule.
The tide pool had once been connected to the sea, but since then an army of sluggish days had marched by and evaporation had increased the concentration of organic molecules.
Things had been tough for a long time, but now it was easier for small chains of molecules to form.
A longer chain with a sinister look formed on the clay bottom, but then a speedy molecule slammed into it like brass knuckles on a Ming vase and disappeared into the night.
In the upper atmosphere, the water, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide that composed the comet had been shock heated and converted into dozens of different organic molecules.
The shock wave from the impact hit the pool, increasing the 39 temperature of the water like a match in a bathtub still.
When the Sun rose in the morning, its bright ultraviolet light sped things up.
Many complex chains of molecules were formed in the newly enriched tide pool.
One of the new chains had the unique property that it could reproduce itself using the molecules in the tide pool as raw materials.
The simple molecules of the tide pool began to feel like swimmers with concrete galoshes.
It didn't take long before most of the bit players had been consumed and the tide pool was filled with copies of the new chain.
Then a high tide came in and washed many of the big boys out to sea, where they began to prey upon a new set of short, helpless chains of molecules.
The long chains of molecules continued to reproduce themselves in a shallow bay near the tide pool by feasting upon the smaller chains in the area.
Some of the long chains lost the ability to produce reproducing copies of themselves, but every so often a molecular chain formed that could reproduce itself even better than the rest, and soon the area was swarming with this kind of chain.
The process led from complex chains of molecules to even more complicated groups of molecules.

The Earth MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS In Which Organisms Composed of Many Specialized Cells Arise ASSOCIATIVE DISORDERS The essential feature of these disorders is the alteration of individual cells to become mutually dependent upon one another for various cellular functions.
If it occurs with identical cells (as in Colonial Organism Disorder), then the cells become temporarily or permanently associated but little integration of cellular activities occurs.
A state of being is defined here as an enduring pattern of existence wherein the individual cells combine to participate in food consumption or production, reproduction, and locomotion as a single entity.
In classic cases, the collection of cells is 48 permanently associated as a colonial organism; in other cases, transient collections of cells can form a temporary aggregation.
Diagnostic criterion for 314.15 Colonial Organism Disorder _ A The existence of only one distinct state of being within a group of identical cellular organisms.
In classic cases (Complex Multicellular Organism Disorder), a large amount of cellular specialization occurs, with different types of cells being responsible for locomotion, reproduction, and other cellular functions.
In other cases (Simple Multicellular Organism Disorder), only a limited amount of cellular specialization occurs.
Today we have with us two pair of protozoans who have swapped chromosomes.
We will protect their identities by calling them Protozoans 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Well, Terri, it just feels so good to be able to exchange advantageous characteristics with loved ones.
Eor example, if I develop a more efficient method of locomotion, I want my sweetheart to be able to move in the same way.
When we're in the mood, my lover and I merge and share protoplasm, during which we do the chromosome swapping.
Afterwards we separate and during our next cell division, our new chromosomes are used.
Terri, I want to be able to join with my partners more intimately by giving them all of my chromosomes while keeping copies for myself.
I agree with what Protozoan 3 has to say, but I foresee an even greater advance, in which instead of reproducing by dividing into two identical cells, we divide into four cells, each containing half of our genetic information.
These cells would then be able to join with cells from other protozoans, and we would have a very efficient method of producing new traits, which could then be tested via natural selection.
I call it sexual 52 reproduction and I think everyone will be doing it soon.
Palaeolyngbya, reported the results at the annual meeting of RAAC, the Rodinia Association for the Advancement of Cyanobacteria.
Bacterial astronomers recently discovered that in only five billion years the sun will run out of hydrogen in the core and expand to engulf the Earth.
Palaeolyngbya's team is responsible for developing the capability to explore the solar system and the Galaxy for new places to live.
Palaeo54 lyngbya, “we hoped to be able to develop simple multicellular organisms that would then evolve into life forms we could use to explore the Galaxy.
Gloeocapsomorpha is leading the effort to evolve the arthropods into “intelligent” creatures that will be able to build space ships to leave the Earth, taking bacteria volunteers with them.
Although the arthropods appear to have the best chance to complete the project, a small group is trying to evolve the chordates.
The bacterial scientists estimate that it will take about half a billion years to develop the capability for space flight, and then another few hundred mill ion years to completely colonize the Galaxy.
Now we are testing whether this subphylum, or any subphylum so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this subphylum might live.
But, in a larger sense we can not dedicate—we can not conescrate—we can not hallow this mud.
The brave trilobites, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
In research funded by previous TSF grants we developed improved lungs and began to replace fins with feet.
The improved lungs extract oxygen from air in addition to the oxygen we obtain from the water with gills, and have since been used extensively in shallow stagnant ponds and bays where the oxygen content in the water is too low for gills to function properly.
The feet have been very useful in traversing the bottom of swampy regions on the edges of continents.
Such locomotion does not alert prey to our presence the way that swimming does, and has therefore dramatically increased our ability to obtain food.
For example, because air is much less dense than water, on land the downward gravitational force will not be balanced by an upward buoyancy force.
We will therefore need compact and muscular bodies to overcome the force of gravity.
For complete COL we will also need to be able to reproduce out of the water.
This will require eggs that will hold water while being 59 permeable to the oxygen that is so important to developing embryos.
Although this problem is difficult, it is not intractable, and it will be the subject of a future TSF grant proposal if the current proposal is funded and successful.

The Earth MAMMAL EXPANSION In Which Many Species of Mammals Develop MAMMALIA CLASS PROSPECTUS A Balanced Class of Vertebrates TAM-CO, Tertiary Animal Management Company Pangea, Earth The Mammalia Class is a diversified open-ended class of vertebrates that seeks to provide long-term growth.
The Class invests about 65% of its species in placental mammals, about 32% of its species in marsupial mammals, about 3% in multituberculates, and less than 0.1% in monotremes.
As with any investment that is subject to wide fluctuations in environmental conditions, you could lose resources by investing in the Class.
These species have not been approved or disapproved by the Species and Environmental Commission, nor has the Species and Environmental Commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus.
Remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns.
Examples include the prairie-dog-like Eambdopsalis and the squirrel-like Ptilodus.
A highly successful subclass, especially in some parts of the world, marsupials have short gestational periods.
The Eutheria are placental mammals and are the most successful mammal subclass, with indications that they will become even more successful over time.
Placental mammals bear live young that are nourished before birth by a placenta.
The Class invests in species that show great promise for future returns.
As a result of the failure of the Dinosauria subclass in 65 million years B.C., the Mammalia Class has shown a great deal of recent diversification, especially among the carnivorous mammals.

I said, I appreciate that, but I'll have no more talk about the fifty ways.
Furthermore there is a plan that I like better, I confess And then she killed me, took my land, and became marquise.
Caravans of hundreds of donkeys traveled twelve hours a day or more to and from Armenia, and ships full of timber sailed to Egypt and returned with fish, flax, papyrus, alabaster, lentils, and gold.
Overreaching leaders, faltering armies, overuse of farmland, but none of them really fit.
After spending 12 years in field research, Erank and I get together to compare notes.
It looks like the population in the north abandoned their homes and moved south into the cities, overtaxing water and food supplies and leading to urban chaos.
Hmm... this soil has very few earthworm holes but lots of wind-blown fine dust.
If the north dried out, then the wheat, barley, and sheep that provided the empire with wealth would have disappeared.
Upon arrival back in Ann Arbor, Friday and Jones wrote up their results and submitted a series of papers to the American Journal of Archaeology.
Explaining the disappearance of the Akkadian Empire is rewardable by not less than tenure and not more than promotion to full professor.
The Earth CIVILIZATION In Which Many and Sundry Events Occur “Good morning class, and welcome back to World History.
He was the son of King Solomon and because of his misrule the northern tribes broke away from Jerusalem and established the kingdom of Israel.
By this time all his elephants had perished, and despite his military victories, his home of Carthage failed to 87 give him sufficient support.
In the end, he could never muster enough strength to assault Rome itself in the fifteen years that his army ravaged Italy.
Yes, that was when Emperor Wu-Ti became a Buddhist and introduced Buddhism to central China.
In 1378 the cardinals had elected Urban VI as pope, but within four months they had declared that election null and void and elected Clement VII instead, creating two lines of popes.
He soon died and was replaced by John XXIII, but Gregory XII and Benedict XIII refused to step down, so now there were three 88 popes.
That was the year Martin Luther felt compelled to protest the Church's granting of indulgences.
Oh, yeah, that was the year that Yoshimune became the eighth shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
Only 33 when he became shogun, he was known as one of the wisest rulers in the history of Japan.
He carried out many reforms and encouraged the martial arts and education.
Your facts about Yoshimune are correct, but he became shogun in 1716, not in 1717.
Tomorrow we're going to be discussing the preamble to the Constitution of the United States.
The executive branch will be headed by a President, whose term will be four years.
President and vicepresident to be elected by electors from each state, chosen in 90 a fashion approved by the state legislature.
OK, the president will be the person who receives the most electoral votes, and the vice-president will be the person who receives the second largest number of electoral votes.
What if... —Okay, Okay, I know you could've chosen to call Constitution King.
Yes, I know that their advertising says that special orders don't upset them.
Well, give us a call if you change your mind. —OK, we'll fill in the details and get this to you by September 17.
For though the Luddites break looms there Still a chance that they will see They can all get jobs in industry.
The Earth WORLD CONFLAGRATIONS In Which Most of the World Is at War “Good evening, and welcome to World at War, the game show that lets you decide the fate of the world.
Colonel Dimitrijevic, it's June of 1914 and you want to insure Serbia's independence from Austria-Hungary.
In addition, this plan would require Germany to attack France as soon as Russia mobilized, regardless of whether it was a strategically good time to do so.
Premier Salandra, the Great War has started and Italy has declared itself neutral.
Italy would be unable to win any decisive battles, would suffer heavy casualties, and would gain little or no territory.
It's 1917, and the War hasn't been going well, in part due to American supplies being shipped to the Allies.
Your submarine warfare would not cripple the Allied cause, but it would draw America into the War and lead to a German defeat.
President Wilson of the United States, Prime Minister Lloyd George of Britain, and Premier Georges 95 Clemenceau of France.
Gentlemen, Germany has been defeated and a treaty to end the war must be drafted.
That would worsen the economic situation in Germany and increase nationalist feelings in the country while leaving it with an enormous potential for military buildup, which could lead directly to future German aggression.
Mr Churchill, it is the early 1930s and nationalism is on the rise in India.
The Labour government wishes to make concessions, as do many in your own Conservative party.
Not only is an independent India destined to happen, but such an action on your part would politically isolate you at a time when England might have to remain strong in the face of a dictator in, for example, Germany.
Chancellor Dolfuss, the year is 1934 and many Austrians would like to see a union of Austria with Nazi Germany.
Italian Premier Benito Mussolini says that he would support Austrian independence only if socialist parties are banned from politics.
That would destroy the one political force with the potential to resist the Nazis.
You would probably be murdered by Austrian Nazis, and although Mussolini would protect Austria for a few years, it would inevitably fall to the Nazis and be absorbed by Germany.
General Gamelin, it is 1940 and a German attack on France is inevitable.
The year is 1941 and you have been warned that Germany is about to break the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact.
Premier Konoye, your Foreign Minister is urging you to sign a Three-Power Pact with Germany and Italy.
Had the resources you put into battleships gone into submarines instead, this might have worked, but as it is Britain would be able to survive and the economic and military might of the United States would be brought to bear against you, leading to your defeat.
Convince one or more of the countries that have atomic weapons to detonate one where and when you like.
This would probably be difficult to do, unless you happen to want a fission explosion on a small island in the Pacific, in a desert, or near a border between two countries who have recently announced that they have nuclear weapons.
One or more of the countries that have atomic weapons may be willing to part with a few for the right price.
You could use uranium , but this is difficult to obtain since more than 99 percent of uranium is U-238, which isn't suitable for use as an active material in bombs.
Although the weapons-grade device will reliably release kilotons of energy, the reactor-grade device will ha ve a less predictable yield of between ^Band kilotons.
Despite this disadvantage, you will probably have a much easier time obtaining the reactor-grade plutonium.
Construct a spherical shell around this sphere withwedgeshaped grooves on the inside of the shel Th e grooves should be covered thick layer of gold and of polonium.
Then make^^l identical plutonium wedges and assemble them into a soccer ball shape surrounding the spherical shell.
Put conventional explosives around the plutonium shell and a^^|cm thick shell of Uranium-238 around the explosives.
Finally, it would be good to have a lead shell around the whole thing to cut down on the radiation coming from the plutonium and uranium before the bomb is detonated.
When a plutonium atom absorbs a neutron it splits into two smaller atoms (for example, strontium and barium), which releases energy and several more neutrons.
These neutrons each go on to split other plutonium atoms, which emit more energy and neutrons.
Since Uranium-238 is a very good reflector of neutrons, any neutrons that escape from the plutonium sphere will be bounced back by the uranium shell.
The chain reaction continues until betweenH% and of the plutonium atoms have been split, at which point so much energy has been released that the bomb (and much of the surrounding countryside) is vaporized.
The surgeon general has determined that fission explosions may be hazardous to your health.
The Solar System SPACE EXPLORATION In Which Humans Begin to Explore Outer Space ""We choose to go to the moon.
On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, making a one-orbit flight.
Hundreds of people and thousands of satellites have followed these pioneers into Earth orbit.
The satellites study the Earth, transmit telephone calls between continents, make observations of the Universe, and allow anyone in the world with a satellite dish and a descrambler to watch soap operas and dirty movies.
Spacecraft have been sent to study the Moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and comets and asteroids.
An asteroid six miles on a side would satisfy the current world demand for aluminum, chromium, and gold for twenty to thirty thousand years.
At current prices, the gold alone in one such asteroid would be worth about 60 trillion dollars.
It is possible that life on a planet like the Earth will keep mutating and evolving until it develops a species intelligent enough to invest in a program to detect and divert potentially catastrophic comets and asteroids.
Data from high-speed cameras suggested that the velocity of the plate was more than 40 miles per second right after the nuclear blast.
This velocity is high enough for the plate-if it survived the passage through the atmosphere-to have escaped not only from the Earth, but also from the Solar System.
Their starting point is different, and their courses are not the same; yet each of them seems to be marked out by the will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe.
On October 15, 1962, photos of Cuba taken from an American U-2 spy plane revealed nuclear-capable Soviet missiles that would have been able to reach much of the United States.
Many of President Kennedy's closest advisors supported an immediate invasion, not knowing that the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had 98 tactical nuclear weapons that could very well have been used against an American invasion force.
The individual pilots had the ability, though not the authority, to fire their nuclear-tipped missiles.
On the evening of October 22, the President addressed the people of the United States, announcing to the world the presence of Soviet missile bases in Cuba and demanding that they be removed.
On October 24, Soviet ships on their way to Cuba were stopped by United States Naval vessels.
They had been delivered in September, and on October 24 the missile officers began frantically working to get the missiles online as soon as possible.
He shot at the intruder and sounded the sabotage alarm, which alerted airfields all over the area to watch for possible saboteurs.
At Volk Field in Wisconsin, however, the klaxon signaling a nuclear war went off by mistake.
The pilots immediately started their nuclear-armed interceptors and were moving down the runway when an officer drove his vehicle in front of them and ordered them to stop.
The base commander had phoned Duluth and found out that it was the sabotage alarm that should have sounded, not the nuclear war klaxon.
This was a previously scheduled test, but no one had thought to cancel it, despite the fact that the other nine test missiles had been loaded with nuclear weapons during the previous two days.
The pilot radioed for help and nuclear-armed Air Force F-105 jets were scrambled to escort the pilot back.
The Soviets launched interceptors to shoot down the U-2, but it returned to American airspace before they could reach it.
Had the U-2 been attacked, it would have been within the local Air Force base commander's authority to order the FI05s to use nuclear missiles against the Soviet aircraft.
The interceptor pilots had the ability, and in the case of a communications failure, the authority, to attack hostile Soviet aircraft by using their nucleartipped missiles.
At the same time, a satellite came over the horizon at just the wrong moment, resulting in a real radar detection despite the fictional missile.
I certainly hope that Knabsnoitan is more liberal in interpreting these directives than he used to be.

Let's say you’re an astronomer and you’re working on a Saturday afternoon because you have more to do than can be fit into a 40-hour workweek.
After a few hours of work you realize that you’re bored by tbe details of what you’re doing and that you’ve got to do something different, even if only for an hour or so, or else you’ll take “hit any key to continue” far too literally.
Even though you know that the end result of your work will be an improved knowledge of the Universe around us, getting to that end result can be a trial at times.
You are, after all, an astronomer, and cosmology, the study of the origin and history of the Universe, is a subfield of astronomy, so you feel quite well qualified to write such a history.

The Earth EXTRAPOLATION In Which Future Events Are Discussed Extrapolation is a very important concept but it can be quite difficult to do well.
To put it simply, extrapolation is trying to figure out what will happen based on what has already happened.
Interpolation is easier, that's just using what happened at the start and at the end in order to figure out what happened in the middle.
I wrote the Extrapolation chapter of A Briefer History of Time on December 31, 1997.
So instead of attempting to use my powers of extrapolation to make further predictions about the future.
I’ll use this space to tell you a little more about the version of A Briefer History of Time you’re reading right now.
In some ways it’s better because I’ve fixed typos and made a few improvements.
However, it lacks the illustrations the hardcopy version has and some of the chapters here aren’t formatted quite as nicely.
You are free to copy, distribute, display, and perform this work as long as you give me credit, do not use this work for commercial purposes, and do not alter, transform, or build upon this work.

They are much less massive than the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of atoms.
An organism in a symbiotic relationship with the organism within which it is living.
For example, two protons both have positive electric charge and therefore repel each other, with the strength of the repelling force being proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance.
In other words, the closer the protons get, the larger the force pushing them apart becomes and the more energy is required to overcome the repelling force.
When the two protons are sufficiently close then the strong nuclear force can hold them together because it is much stronger than the electromagnetic force pushing them apart.

Erom one point of view, these particles and antiparticles don't really exist because they are created from nothing and go back to nothing in a very short period of time.
However, while they are there they do have mass and energy, so even though they are “virtual” particles, they contribute to the energy density of space.
If the “vacuum” energy density is very large then the universe can expand exponentially, and this is thought to have happened during the inflationary period very soon after the Big Bang.
The second planet from the Sun, its mass is 80 percent of that of the Earth, and its diameter is 7500 miles.
