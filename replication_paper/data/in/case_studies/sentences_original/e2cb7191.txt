Paul H Ni tze A suggested course of action re the contingency one of our surveillance 1.
Time permitting we should lay an appropriate base of public understanding of the current situation as a foundation for future action.
As soon as we have confirmation that the ships carrying Soviet mi ssi les have actually departed Cuban waters, the public should be informed that the Soviets have carried ou( only a portion of their obligations pursuant to the Kennedy-Khrushchev exchange of letters and that they have given no indication as yet of intending to fulfill other essential portions of those commitments.
They have not made It ""* possible for the UN effectively to verify the dismantling and removal of all weapons systems in Cuba capable of offensive use, and have concurrently denied the legitimacy of United States surveillanc e in the absence of effective UN verification.
Together wi th the Cuban regime, they appear to be frustrating the development of effective safeguards against the reintro rii.ft inn f offensive weapons systems.
We should then communicate to the Russiai standing of the original exchange of commitments, warnings to them wi th respect tc interference with surveillance, and inform them that, unlesj they will g< jve us prompt and specific assurances that our planes will not be interfered with, we will have to take appropriate measur* to protect our surveillance flights and reimpose and extend the quarantine.
Simultaneously we would announce to the public that one of our planes had been shot at or destroyed and indicate the nature of the position we were communicating to the Soviet lihion.
After the elapse of sufficient time for the message to the Soviet Union to have reached Moscow and for them to have instructed their people in Cuba, we should resume surveillance flights.
