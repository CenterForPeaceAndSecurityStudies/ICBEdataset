Horse carts carry passengers and fresh-cut green bananas through narrow streets lined with pastel-colored homes.<\/p>\n<p>The sleepy town doesn&#8217;t seem like the kind of place to put an arsenal of nuclear weapons.
He was 19.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Well, most probably what will happen is we will see a big flash.
Like Fidel Castro, he insists it was the failed Bay of Pigs invasion by U.S.-backed Cuban exiles in April 1961 that led directly to the missile crisis, pushing Castro to reach for an equalizer to deter future United States intervention.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The United States was pursuing relentlessly a policy of regime change in Cuba,&#8221; Alzugaray says.
His brother Raul now runs Cuba but doesn&#8217;t have the same affection for re-hashing the glory days with old foes.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, Fidel Castro hosted a gathering that brought together aging Soviet commanders with former Kennedy advisers like Robert McNamara and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Low-Key Commemoration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s commemoration will be far more low-key.
It was Khrushchev, they say, who blinked.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we lost a great opportunity in the crisis,&#8221; Morales says.
But the chaos and fear of those days are still alive in the memories of those who lived through it.
He was told it was Soviet missile construction.<\/p>\n<p>The sites were close enough \u2014 just 90 miles from the United States \u2014 and the missiles launched from there could reach major American cities in mere minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The Cold War was heating up to a near-boiling point.<\/p>\n<p>For a two-week period, Kennedy consulted with his closest advisers about what to do.
Others say he just wanted a very accurate record for history of what was actually said.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bredhoff is curator at the John F Kennedy Library in Boston.
While they conferred, the stakes kept mounting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At one point the president says, &#8216;Time ticks away on us,'&#8221; Bredhoff says.
And that&#8217;s what the president wanted to avoid.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kennedy heard a range of opinions about how to respond.<\/p>\n<p>George Ball, undersecretary of state, urged restraint.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A course of action where we strike without warning is like Pearl Harbor,&#8221; he says in the recording.
It is not conduct that one expects of the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But Bredhoff says others, particularly Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, almost bait the president, &#8220;just falling short of calling him a coward for not taking direct, quick military action.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that a blockade and political talk would be considered by a lot of our friends and neutrals as being a pretty weak response to this,&#8221; LeMay says.
This so-called quarantine would keep the Soviets from bringing in any more military supplies.<\/p>\n<p>That same day, Kennedy came clean to the nation about what was happening.
Oct., 1962, marked the first time the president spoke publicly about the missile crisis.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out.
No one can see precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred,&#8221; Kennedy says in the televised speech.<\/p>\n<p>There was a single combat casualty.
Rudolf Anderson Jr. was shot down during a reconnaissance mission over Cuba.<\/p>\n<p>But overall, Kennedy&#8217;s strategy was a resounding success.<\/p>\n<p>Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made a deal.
And in secret, the United States agreed to remove all of its missiles from Turkey, which bordered the Soviet Union.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine the weight of the responsibility of the decisions that he was making,&#8221; Bredhoff says of Kennedy.
Polmar says sailors didn&#8217;t fear radioactive leaks or explosions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No problems at all with the nuclear plant, absolutely none,&#8221; he says.
It was the eighth to bear the name Enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>The first was a British vessel, captured during the American Revolution and renamed by the man who led that raid \u2014 Benedict Arnold.<\/p>\n<p>The first carrier named Enterprise saw intense action in the Pacific during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>Less than a year after the new Enterprise came into service, it started making its own history.
During the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, President John Kennedy, a former sailor himself, ordered a naval blockade of Cuba.
The Enterprise and its sailors were sent to take part.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port, when they&#8217;re found to carry cargo of offensive weapons will be turned back,&#8221; Kennedy said at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Polmar, the naval historian, says that &#8220;when the ship departed from Norfolk they made their phone calls and said goodbye I hope I&#8217;m back here in a few days.
They were scared that this was the end but they did their jobs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The standoff lasted 13 days, before Soviet ships turned around.
The Enterprise went on to set a world record by making a round-the-world cruise in two months in 1964 \u2014 the first ship to do so without refueling.
Nuclear power meant the ship could cruise almost indefinitely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Role In The Vietnam War<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By comparison, a World War II carrier could go about three days before it needed to refuel, according to retired Rear Adm.
He commanded the Enterprise during the closing days of the Vietnam War.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the first bombing runs into North Vietnam flew from its deck in 1965 \u2014 and so did the last, says Tissot, who watched from the bridge in early 1973, in the last days of direct United States involvement in the fighting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The last sortie of the war we flew off Enterprise.
And one of our F-4 pilots was shot down and killed,&#8221; he recalls.<\/p>\n<p>Vietnam was the last major combat the Enterprise would see for some time.
The ship was the setting for one of the top films of the 1980s, as Cruise, aka Maverick, trained to become a fighter pilot in <em>Top Gun.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hollywood also called on the Enterprise to chase the only known Soviet sub captain with a Scottish burr \u2014 think Sean Connery \u2014 in <em>The Hunt for Red October.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>A Return To Combat<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Enterprise would eventually find real adversaries once again.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, Vice Adm.
John Morgan was on the flag bridge of the Enterprise when he got a phone call from an aide who told him the World Trade Center had been attacked.
Morgan had been in command of the Enterprise battle group only three days.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I reflexively picked up the phone and called the captain of the aircraft carrrier and said redirect the battle group to the coast of Pakistan and make best speed to do so,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The ship was supposed to return to Norfolk.
But Morgan&#8217;s gut told him the attack was the work of Osama bin Laden, and the Enterprise would be going to war.
Its warplanes flew some of the first attacks against the Taliban in Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p>And two years later, in 2003, its pilots and crew would take part in another fight, this time against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the Enterprise has come home to Norfolk for the last time, after more than 50 years at sea.
The ship will be scrapped, but the most famous name in the Navy will live on.
It&#8217;s played a featured role in world conflicts \u2014 and Hollywood movies \u2014 for more than a half-century.
Nuclear weapons are the most powerful devices ever developed by human beings.
For one thing, above-ground nuclear tests just aren&#8217;t done anymore.
The last atmospheric test anywhere in the world was conducted by China in 1980.<\/p>\n<p>A North Korean test would also release fallout into the environment.
That radioactive material could travel in unexpected directions, including toward the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, to reach a remote part of the Pacific, a nuclear-tipped North Korean missile would have to fly over Japan \u2014 as have past North Korean missile tests.

First, there are two major music festivals in D.C., then there&#8217;s an Embassy world tour, and it&#8217;s all bookended by Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday.
This year&#8217;s event will have live music &#8220;activations&#8221; at three different spots along U Street.
She says\u00a0 working in the activist space, along with her identity as a Palestinian-American, help her to find inspiration for her work.
Key differences emerged on whether the city should hire more police officers and if the system of mayoral control of schools should remain intact.<\/p>\n<p>The debate came with fewer than 50 days until the city\u2019s June 21 all-important Democratic primary, during which Mayor Muriel Bowser will be asking voters for a third term in office.
During the debate, she pushed back on arguments made by progressive activists \u2014 and her two challengers \u2014 that police don\u2019t prevent crime.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a community where they say they don\u2019t want the police.
Never,\u201d she said, detailing her years in public office and many conversations with residents. \u201cThey tell me they want to make sure the police are engaged and they have a trusting relationship.
Councilmember Robert White said he is skeptical of efforts to hire more police.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Robert White, though, said Bowser\u2019s push for 4,000 officers isn\u2019t based on any specific data on how many officers MPD should ideally have.
He said he supports calls for an audit of the department\u2019s staffing to determine what the appropriate number of officers should be.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years to reach 4,000 officers.
What we need is the right number of police, not just more police,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>White also said police need to focus on closing more cases, and that he would work more closely with federal prosecutors to determine why some cases are being dropped.
That\u2019s an issue that we can solve right now, and we are years behind on that,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Trayon White sounded similar notes, saying that police staffing was high during the city\u2019s most violent years in the earlyand mid-1990s and it made little difference in crime rates.
While 59% said they agreed that more police on patrol could help, 82% said additional economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods could make a dent.<\/p>\n<p>The three candidates broke different on the issue of whether police should remain in D.C. schools.
Robert White agreed with the council\u2019s move, while Trayon White says he opposes it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis generation has become more violent, let\u2019s be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t have anyone authorized to break up fights, it becomes extremely violent.
And the three candidates disagreed over whether that should remain the case.<\/p>\n<p>Both Robert White and Trayon White advocated for more independence for the Office of the State Superintendent for Education and a stronger state board; Trayon White went as far as saying that he would share the decision of who the schools chancellor would be with the board.
Those statements left an opening for Bowser, who said the two lawmakers had over the months provided shifting answers on the question of who should control the schools.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cD.C. residents want a mayor they can trust.
And if your answer shifts depending on which way the wind blows, they can\u2019t trust you with their kids.
And the most important thing you have to do as mayor is provide mayoral leadership of the schools.
And I think what we\u2019ve heard are councilmembers who are equivocating and waffling.
I\u2019m straight forward,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Robert White pushed back, arguing that Bowser is making mayoral control seem like a simple yes-no proposition, while it is more complicated than that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need a mayor who\u2019s not just going to go to the easy talking points, but who\u2019s going to get in the details.
And that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t have a clear understanding of why so many students are leaving our schools.
There is an urgent problem, and we need a mayor with a sense of urgency on public education,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Robert White said he would increase trade and vocational offerings to boost enrollment in schools east of the Anacostia River and reduce teacher turnover.
Trayon White said the significant increase in charter schools has impacted enrollment and investment at traditional public schools, and said he supports a moratorium on new charters.
He also pledged to reduce testing of students and assessments of teachers, which he called \u201cpunitive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both lawmakers were critical of Bowser\u2019s plan to build a new high school in Ward 3, arguing that resources should instead be funneled to other areas of the city.
Bowser responded she had done just that, pointing to the modernizations of Roosevelt and Coolidge high schools in Ward 4.<\/p>\n<h4>Tossing out traffic cameras<\/h4>\n<p>In the portion of the debate addressing traffic fatalities, Trayon White said supports a more rapid rollout of traffic-calming measures on city streets.
The average person in Washington, D.C. doesn\u2019t have disposable income from $300 to $600 a month to address tickets,\u201d he said, adding that he believes the speed and red-light cameras cause more \u201cstress and anxiety\u201d than they succeed in creating safer streets.<\/p>\n<p>Bowser quickly responded that many residents request speed cameras on their streets, and that drivers could simply avoid tickets by slowing down.
She also said she had requested more cameras as part of a broader $200 million plan to re-engineer streets and roads to make them safer for cyclists and pedestrians.
On fines, Bowser said that Trayon White was already empowered to make the changes he is proposing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe councilmember is a budget-maker and he\u2019s a policymaker.
And the same dynamic was at play on whether D.C. should try and get the Washington Commanders back; Bowser and Trayon White are supportive of getting the team, while Robert White said he\u2019d rather see if the RFK stadium campus be used for housing and recreation.<\/p>\n<p>The Democratic primary is on June 21.
