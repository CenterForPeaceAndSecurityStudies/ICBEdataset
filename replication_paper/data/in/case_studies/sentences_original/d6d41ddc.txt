At a cabinet meeting John F Kennedy made several attempts to spell decisions.
IMMEDIATE RE LEASE OCTOBER 27 1 1*42 Office of the White Kougc Free a Secretary THE WHITE HOUSE Several inconoi stent and conflicting proposals have been made by the USSR within the last twenty -four hours, including tiis one just made public in Moscow.
The proposal broadcast this morning involves the security cf nations outside the Western Hemisphere, But it ie the Western Hemisphere countries ar.d they alone that arc subject to the threat that has produced the current crisis the action, of tho Soviet Government in secretly f tit reducing offensive weapons, into Cvljii, Work on these offensive weapons Is still proceeding at a rapid pace.
The first imperative must he to deal with this immediate threat, under which no sensible negotiation can proceed.
It is therefore the position of the United States thai as an tit* cat preliminary to consideration of any proposals work Otl the Cuban bases must stop; offensive weapons mu*t be rcnrLriid inoperable; and further shipment of offensive weapons to Cuba must cease -all under effective international verification.
As to p reposals concerning the security of nation* outside this Hemisphere, the United States and its allies have long taken, the lead in seeking properly inspected arms limitation, on both fides, These efforts can continue as aoon ao the present Sovietc reate d threat is ended.
In these ■ Circumstances the United States fools it essential to inf em its all±aa and to consult vith thera on the general situation* o* PH» It is of the utmost importance that nothing in VtieA your dlHcttS&ion should hint of eny readiness to inset Soviet Jupiter eoKhanga proposal, out it is equally important that you should vtUfiu fme Egression of European liens* liiafccwcr they may bo.

W the point where *e nak* tha, that i the, uh, overwhelming, ovflrtS-Sl-ng necessity to take all the cinki that ir* involved doing that.
I think that with or without such an invasion, i-n other word* if we make it clear that. uh, ""hat we're doing ifl eliminating thia particular baw or any other auch base that la flBtabliohed, We ourselves aeo not moved togeneral war^ we'ra simply doi*g what Hoid u C would do if thoy took certain action, nh, or we're going to decide that thia in thv tin* t& J eliminate the Cuban problem by action on the Leland.
The other would be, if we have a lew daye— froo the military point Of view, if we havo tho whole tirae— uh,. then I would thifllt that, uh H there would bo another course of action, a COti&i nation of things, that, eh, wo might wish to consider.
Kmm, iirst, uh, that we, uh, tttmulata the OfcS {Organization of Muse lean States) procedure immediately foe prompt action to make it quite Sitae that the entire hemisphere considers that tho Rio Pact has baen violated, that acta, whatever action* we take In, undce the teiss of the Rio Pact* The Cits could constitute itself an organ of consultation promptly, although maybe.
This ought to bo brought to Caafcro's attention* It aught to be said to Castro that, uh, uh, this kind Of a base is intolerable and not accept able* The time has (low coma whan ho muet in the Interests of the Cubart people, must now break clearly with the Soviet tfniOrt, prevent this missile baee from becoming operational And 1 thirtft there are certain military, hmrflj uh, actions that *t can, w* ffllght well want to take straight away.
First, to, uh, t* call up, uh, highly selected unita no more than 150,000, Unless wa feel that it '6 better, more desirable to go to a general national cmoegoftcy bo that wo have complete freedom of action, we announce, at the time that ue announce this development— and think, we do have to announce this dsnclopaont aomo tlmO thio wee! -10uh r wa announce Chat, uh, wo aro conducting 4 aurveillAftre of Cuba, over Cuba, and uo will enforce out right ta do <JO + We *o}ect th* mission of aoerccy Ln thi.fi homLsph&ro In any patter of thie eert.

Mil an sum* that we can p)vo on this lino at the same tiae to interrupt ill air traffic tram. froo world countriesoing into Cub*, ins lac to the K&tficans, the Dutch, that they wtep their plan&s from coming Ln.
That Mr lOirushchev n»y not himself really understand that or believe that thin point, I think we'll be cacinC; a situation that could veil 1 to general war; that wo have an obligation to do what h*fl to be J but do it in a way that gives, uh, everybody a chance to, uh, pul away from It down before It g:etfl too hard.
There might have to bo 4 aarond phas*, and than it would require * declaration of a national emergency.
That dies not preclude, 1 don't think, Mr Secretary, sose of the things that you've boon talking aboutIt's i little hard te (ay in terme of time how nvueh I'm dioemfl & Lng.
So, really, tho, tha point of tine, I'm, thinking in term of three phases.
One, a, an initial pause OE aoee sort while we get completely ready and get, get th& right posture on the part of the target, b< ua ran do the best job.
Then, virtually concurrently, a air strike against , as the secretary aaldj nisei lea, airfields, uh ( nuclear altee that we know Of. at the same tine, naval blockade.
I'd then Start this continuous voconnAioaance, the list that you had r continue ovor Cuba. -13then, then the doelalon can bo rude a a we, as we TO mobilliln9 H uh P with the air etrike M to whether we invade Or not.
I think that's the hardest question militarily in the whole buoi no a a —ona which wo ohould look at very closely before wo get our fett In Chat deep cud in CubA^ Uh, there Are at-, one or two ether thing a , Mr* Preaidont, uh.
Uh, but tfcat I juot want to you that you are oooing him and that tay be relevant to this conflict* I'm net suggesting that necesfiarily, that you d*lay It or anything Olao you have to do at this point.
Secondly, I don't believe, myself, that the critical question is whether you get a particular missile before it 9°** off fcsrau.se IE thdy shoot thoafi missile □ «e art In general nuclear war.
In ether words, the Soulet Union haa got quite a different decision to make.
If th*y r if they shoot those mlaallsBj want to ahOOt *e all before they cjot knocked out by aircraft So.
Bob, Well, I would strongXy.omphaaizO that 1 thin* our tic* should be baocd on the asowrf.pt ion it in, Dean.
Wo don't know what kind* of communication* the Soviet* have with thoae siteor what klndo of control thay have over the warheads.
Huat be oomo major reanon for the Russians tO r eh, set this up as a Huat be that they're not satisfied with their ICBHs.
What it 'd give ^Cdi Is primarily, it m*koa the launching baee, Uh for short range missiles against the United Stftt&a to auppltment their rather defective iCBil system, for example.
He don't know ""hat thsy 'if* capable Of* If there ace nuclear warheads associated Kith tho launthora, you muat assume there will be nuclear warhc^da associated with aircraft.
Even it there ace not nueleac warheads associated with aircraft, you puat a I Dusia; that those aircraft have high explosive potential.
We're not prepared to report to you exactly f un, what the Cuban air force is capable Of J but 1 think we imiat assume that the Cuban air foreo la definitely capable Ot penetrating, in Small numbers, our coastal air defense by coming in low Over the water* And 1 would think that we would not dare go in against the missile sites, knock thoao out leaving Intntt Castro's air force, and run the risk that he would uee pa* or all af that alt force against our coastal areas-either with 01 without nucitat weapons.
It would be a, a very heavy price to pa in United States lima for the, the damage we did to Cuba.
Khrushchsv may have Lrt aind is that, uh, uh, he Itnowa that »e have a nubstantial nuclear Superiority, &ut he alBO knows that ws don't really live under fear of hiB nuclear weapons to the extent that, uh, ho has to live under the fear of oars, Mao wO have nuclear weapons nearby.
About fifteen, 1 bolieva It ie. 1 think tJiat'a eight, mat's right. [tinlntalligiblel But then there are *1bo delivery vehicles that are, could eaally* + + ItUDiCt Ruoki nuaki Bundyt be moved through the air, aircraft and so forth* polite -Qta thrown Turkey.
I think aim that yh, Berllrt Is, uh, very much involved in this* Kim, fgr the «« time, I'm beginnine. really to wonder whether maybe Mr Xhrushehey is entirely rational about Deri in, We've kind of tftLk*d about hi ob MB eieii with it.
If they could prOvoka v into taking the firet overt action, then the world wOuW h* eonfuaed and thdy would have, uh, what they would consider to be Justification for making a move tLomewhcro elae.
But, uh, 1 fluat say I don't really ate the rationality of , uh, the Soviet*' pushing It thifl far unless they fltoanly misunderstand the importance Of Cuba to this country.
It's important, I think, to tecognUo that they did aaka this decision, as far as our estimate* now go, in early *u™ar r and thin has fceen happening, since August.
The harm loos military BquLpwne aent to Cuba doalgned cueluBivciy for defenaB, defensive purposes.
The president of the United State* and the American allltary, ttir military of arty country know «hat oeana^of defenae ate.
The rest, as the secretary naye, had many comparison batmen Cuba and Italy, Turfcoy ^ Japan.
We bavB other e^idencthat Khrushchev Is, honestly believe a, or, Ot at least affects t believe that we hava nuclear weapon* in.
Bundy: HcNamara: Dundy : HcNamara : Bundy; McHan&r&i Dillon: Ru&k: Bundy: Husk: Bundy: Yeah.
That doitft't make them 3rty loos offensive *o ub. . . because we can't have proof about i-t.
HO, but Lt does pcaotbly indicate a different couroe of action. . ...and therefore, *hile I'm net auggaatlag how «Q should handle thia, I think this io one Of the rott import ant action* wo fihould tak*i to ascertain the location of the nuclei w«HHf for t heed nlinellaa* Later In the discussion «5 can wait back to thin.
TnO only thing I'd, would » r U that, uh, thl> alternative couroO of, of warning, and getting, uh, public opinion, uh, OAS action and telling people In NATO and everything like that, wou» appear to fle to have the dagger of, uh, getting us wide out in th open and forcing the Hue* lan a to, uh, Soviets to take a P a position that if anything wan done, uh, they would, uh, havd to retaliate.
WhOreaa, uh, a, uh ( a quick action, uh, with a statement at the aarae tine aayUg thift LB all there Is to It, might give them a chance to, uh, back off and net do anything.
Meanwhile. think that the chinca of getting through thie thing without a Ru a □ lan ruction it greater under a quick, uh, Strike thaft, uh, building thn whole tning uC to a, 4 Climax then going through..., Therefore, It will be a lot of debate on *t.
And if wb go «Ith th* quic* strike, than, ±n fact, they dQ b*<* it u"" then vou-ve P*e°*e* all of y D ur MUaa and ouraeiv*. to all theae great dangaca without... you get *11 ttieoe nuLCQe again. without, uh, ths alight* tt consultation or, ce warning or preparation, fiut, of con""*, warning them/ till, Lt W«ni to im, -hr « J^**"" 1 everybodyUhn «h, «h, obviously you can't -or* of annC^ca that ™™™.-t t hi B rtr« day* th*r-» goic* *> h*» then; if wo coma and attack then they're going to then.
Bundy: Taylor; -18thia la what you would do peeinvade, ftnd, uh r It would bo vary difficult to convince anybody that thia waa flfit a prainvaaion Strike.

Wo believe tJ.it wc should do this, Now, personally I would recommend, although we don 1 * need.
This is why I would roecrmcnd the two daylight and the one night missions* and I fully agree we ought to put cut an announcement that we are going to send Uie night mission over.
I tl*ink we ought to 90 ahead if they want it, so it + s all right with me.
I think wa might have one more conversation about it, however, at about six o'clock just in case during the day we get Earthing.
Wttza; Hare says this is absolutely anathema, and as a natter of prestige and politics.
Ball s Yeah, we have a report from Finletter, and we T ve also got a report from Kane on the Italians which indicates that that would be relatively easy.
Wa would have to work it out with the Turks on the basis of putting a Polaris in the waters, and even that night not be enough according to the judgment that we T ve had on the spot.
We're ggtng to be in an insupportable position on this matter if this boccnes his proposal* In the first place, we last year tried to get tt* missile* out of 3 there because they're not militarily useful, number 1* Number 2, it's going to — to any man at tine United Nations Ot any other rational nan it will look like a very fair trade.
JFK: A special message appeared to call for negotiations and both nations, Cuba and Turkey, should give tJyoir consent to the United Nations to visit their territories.
Khrushchev said the security Council of the Soviot Union was solemnly pledged not to use its. territory as a bridgehead for an attack on Turkey H called for a similar pledge from the United States not to let its territory be used as a bridgehead for an attack on Cuba.
Ball i we did it on a basis where if we talked to t)*e Turks, I mean tUs would be an extremely iinsettfing business.
Welt this is Unsettling now George, because he's got us in a pretty good spot here, because most people will regard t)j_s as not an unreasonable proposal, I'll just tell you that.
I t)Jnk you're 9oing to find it very difficult to explain why we are going to take J^ostile military action, in Cuba, against these sites — what we've been thinking; about — the thing that he + s saying is, ""If you'll get yours out of Turkey, we'll get ours cut of Cuba** I think we've got a very tough one hare.
Yes, but I think we have to be now thinking about what cur position's going to be On this One, because this is the one that's before us, and before the world, Sacensen : As between the two I tldnk it clear tlit practically everyone here would favor the private proposal.
But in any case this is now his official (sicj , and wc can release his other one, and it 1 s different t but this is the one that the Soviet government obviously is going on.
Isn't it possible that they* re going on a dual track, one a public track and the other a private track; the private track is related to {words unclear) , and the public track is one tdiat's in order to confuse the public scene {words unclear) additional pressures.
I think, yes, I tl4nk that the — uh — NKrcvwarsaw Pact arms problem is a separate problem and ought to be discussed between HATO and Warsaw Pact.
They've got hundreds of missiles locking down the throat of every NATO country.
T}.e other way, it seems to me — if we accept the notion of a trade at tlds stage f cur position will cone apart very fast.
Or if we had any understanding wit}, the Turks that tliey ought to come out, it would be different.
Tt*ey — uh — we persuaded tJiem that this was an essential requirement, and t}*ey — they feel that it f s a matter of prestige and a matter of real**, (mixed voicesl *.pln their own terms it would already be clear ttet we were to sell cur allies for cur interests.
It seers to ids we ought to get word to Stevenson that if this is put up up there Le shcyld immediately say *e will not discuss — disiniss UjC Turkish bases. gundy » The problem is Cuba.
JFK ; I think it would be very desirable to tell tliat until we get time to tliink about it, this thing — tl,e fact of the natter is that we received a letter last night f recti Khrushchev with an entirely different proposal* Therefore we first ought to gat clarification from tide Soviet Union of what they're talking, at least give us — as \ say you're going to find a lot of people think this a ratlier reasonable condition.
Wall, i tldnk that it's relevant here to be able to say that we support tha declaration of Iran that they would not accept foreign missiles in Iran, The Turkish problem is a NAT>Warsaw pact problem, and it's an arms problem between those two groups ttet is something for these two groups to talk about with each other as a problem of disarmament with respect to NKDO and the Warsaw Pact.
He T s put this out in a way that's caused mutfirum tension and embarrassment.
It's not as if it was a private proposal, which would give us an opportunity to negotiate with tl»e Turks.
It may be preparations for counteraction against ttose particular bases that we — uL — Cuba cculd be that.
Until we have gotten our position a little clearer we ought to go with tliis — uh — last night business so that that gives us about an hour or two, we don't have TGd^ishchev,*. &i£k : There's nothing coming in yet on our tickers.
Governor Stevenson reccmrends that such a statement be made in order to prevent the Soviets frem capturing the peace offensive.
Governor Stevenson also recommends tl*at we not consider tide Turkish offer as reported in tide attacW Reuters dispatch as an alternative or an addition to the Khrushdpev proposal in his 6 letter, I think ttiat — uh — we ought to go at — we ought to get a statement ready which will — uh — I f m not suie tJkat — which would — uh — tJyese references to last night's — back on tliat, lumber one* Number two sanettiing about tJje work on the bases stopping while we're going to have a cJ.ar.c to discuss Uiese ratters.
I don't know what we 1 re going to say on the Turkish matter Thar£scns KtirusiicfLev may have picked up tl*e statement which Krcisky, tJie Austrian Foreign Minister, made day before yesterday — has made and which he may Bank was inspired by us, in which he raised the question of Turkish* ► , Low Voice :0f course maybe the Russians got Kreisky to do it, too* Bttgk i And if we publish the letter of. last night.
I think probably this — uh — wJjole exchange, this refers — uh — starting with this crisis — this refers to the previous letters.
It starts out by saying t ""I received your letter,"" I've got the feeling that if you I.ave soreone chaining the situation, you have to publish the cxcJ*angc.
JFKi I don't know, tou perhaps don't have to put out the letter as much as you do the three proposals or sO» EFKi The first point being that this — Uh — this question of Cuba and the {word unclear) imjst be resolved within the ne*t few days; it can't wait.
The negotiations and discussions must — uh — get on, and tl* work that is continuing despite our protests has been going on.
So therefore it's got to be resolved quickly, Uh — .this action that has been taken is not an action just by the United States but is an action by all of tt*e Latin American countries plus the United States.
This lias notJiing to do with the security of the countries of Europe, which do hove their own problems* Uh — we would — uh — obviously consider negotiating the giving up of bases in — uh — Turkey if we can assure tl«e uh — Turks and the other European countries for wltO^ these bases were emplaced tl»at tJiere can be sore assurances given to them for ttieir own security.
This will entail inspection as we anticipate t^iat tiiere will be seme inspection in Cube and in t}*e United States — uh — at the time that these bases are witJdxawn from Cuba and we give assurances tliat we are not going to invade Cuba* Something along those lines.
Bob, we've got three positions. g^MP&on i a lprvg letter last night he wrote himself.
No* we don 1 t* I guess we say we are reluctant to release this ty the inconsistency in your position, but we dWt letter which would display have very much, time.
I don't know what — where you are in twenty-four hours f ran now — uh — so we win that argument but wtiat twenty-four hours*** voices McKamaraE We incorporate a new deal in our letter.
How are we going to Tiave him do anything but take the ball away from us publicly, if we don't — Tf~we just write him a letter, {voices) Bundyj (words unclear} to surface his earlier message ( Bobby. . . an of ttet.
I tijnk that we're going to liave to, m ** e U£ee or four hours, not just pat the ball completely in — uh — In his hands and allow him to do whatever tie *ants.
H^r s offered this deal — uh — that he will withdraw tta bases in Cuba for assurances that we don't intend to invade.
Obviously tl*t entails inspection not only of Cuba but entails inspection of the ^ted States to ensure that ve're not by united Nations observers to ensure that ™e T re not netting ready to — uh — invade.
Mow tide is one o± ti* S^sV^Et 1 ^basWin Cuba uh involve uh of tho Western Hemisphere, rt^is is not just a question of tl* States.
This is a question of all the Latin American countries, which have all Coined tog.etl.fir in this effort.
This flust be breuqht to fruition. — uh 1 — Tt.e question of ti^e Turkish bases, we thii* tint's excellent, that you brought that up, and that uh that ; uh — there stjould be disarmament of the Turkish bases, but that has nothing to do with the security of a* astern lfetnisphere* It have do wito the security of Turkey, and we would be harry, and we're sure the would be, of making a similar arrangement in Turkey.
We will ""lU^dr** tl* bases frcn Turkey if — uh — and allow inspection of Pricey to make sure we've done tliat, and you withdraw your invasion bases — Uh — of t*je Soviet union and permit inspection there.
So tlAt before we've even had a chance to get our own diplomacy the first thing it seems to me we ought to emp)*size is that looisesl But they've givenus several different proposals in twenty-four hours, Juid worfc T s got to fitop today, before we talk about anything , At least then we're in a defensible position.
The ott^er ttdng is to not tiave the Turks making statements, so that this thing — Khrud<chev puts it out and toe neat thing tlrfs Turks say they won't accept it, nlfin whatever we do in Turkey — in Cuba — it seems to me has set the groundwork to do something in Turkey, So I think we ought to have the Turks — we ought to have a talk with the Turks because I think they've got to understand the peril that they're going to move in the next week, When we take SOP* action in Cuba, chances are that lie' 11 take sow action in Turkey, and tl^ey ought to understand that.
They belong to Turkey aid are maimed by Turks, but the warheads are in U* S custody, ' Voice : It seems to ifle that.
Eundy i I think it would be very important to say at least that the current threat to peace is not restricted to Cuba* Ttiere + s no pain in saying that if you think you' re going to make a trade later on.
Wiflt being so — uh — until we find out What is really being suggested and what can really be discussed, we have to get scrrething on work — the main weakness here is the work's going on.
While you were cut of the room, Mr, President, we reached an informal consensus — I don't fcnow whetl,er TOnrny agrees — rJiat tikis — last night's message was Khrushchev and tide one is Ms cwn hard-nosed people overruling him — this public one — that tliey didn't like what he said to you last night.
JFK} The only tiling is, Tanry, why wouldn't they say it privately if they were serious.
JFK t Jtow let's — uh — I would think the first tiling we have to do is to — as 1 say, rattier tlian get into tl*e deteils — the fact that work is going on is the one defensible public position we've got* They^ve got a very good card.
It's going to be tough in England, I'm sure — as well as other places on the continent — we're going to be forced to take action, tfiat might seen, in ny opinion, not a blank check but a pretty good check to take action in Berlin on the grounds tl*at we were wholly unreasonable.
Most tliink — people think that if you're allowed an even trade you ought to take advantage of it* Therefore it makes it much more difficult for us to move with world support.
These are all tl*e things that> — uh — why this is a pretty good play of Us.
He could take missiles for missiles, which wuldn't be good enough frtm our point of vie*, because its to Cuba.
It would be tough anyway, JFK; It would be tough for tfiree weeks {*ords unclear) because the problem is if the work on their bases stops r tint's in tip/ opinion cur defensible position.
HcKarara i Stop tf.e ti.fi cperability of it — uh — McMgniara i I would certainly put tfnt in the same rcessagsIt isn t enough to stop work on a base that's already operable.
JFK* we've got to — new let's see nwlet's see what Steve-ison's suggesting.
Mr, President, , voice * I would guess it was on V* order of at least a hundred, within range.
To get the barters out of Cuba we'd have to get tl*a nuclear weapons and planes out of Turkey, ^ ^ Tt^rpson i It seems that you can't tell which one went first.
One went t).ere ana Tone ""went here, but he thinks that they were sent about the sane time, [voices unclear) ^amarai.
Well — uh — iSovernor we'd j r* 1 ^i, 1 ^ ******* — uh — you know the letter tl*t I received last night was different than this, H.at's your judgment Right [listens 15 sees) Yes Yeah (listens 40 sees} and to act against Cuba „.in addition (listens 30 sees,* Sounds like a , Yeah, that's wJ.at it presented us (listens 18 sees j I thin* we've been around and around loc much of that.
Let's get it out of this problem, tl.sn we might as well x mean jWt decide on sand in his gears for a few minutes.
That's not any goodj I'm }ust trying to cope with what the public problem is about — because everybody's going to think that this is very reasonable* ' Dillon* This Turkish thing has got to be throve — you're quite right, Mr, President — into the overall European oontetffc, and you can bring in Berlin; 1 think it's fine.
Because it's not only going to be Turks that are going to be answering here, but the Germans are going to be making statements in Urfs next few hours, as well as other people about ads when they* re asked, and they're going to take a very strong position.
Wow }ust before the Foreign Ministers which isn't really very strong as decisions go.
On this last paragraph r Mr Secretary r I tl±ink we ought tr> say ""As I was preparing this letter t which was prepared in response: to your private letter of last night, I learned of your — rids immediate crisis in Cuba, and so forth.
Be prepared to discuss our actions, the detailed thinking (voices unclear) JFK : Well, be prepared to discuss the — uh — your public message — the matters in your public message, or the issues in your public message.
Tcflorrow he h ll cone back and say U*e United States has rejected this proposal we've made.
So I think we ought to be able to say that — uh — the matter of Turkey, and so on, in fact all tJ^ese matters, ought to be — can be discussed if he* 11 cease work, otherwise he's going to announce tljit we've rejected his proposal.
Unless we all agree, unless we all mean to announce tJiSt we've rejected it, I don't think we ought to do it today.
If we can oet assurance firm — which can be inspected that thev will cease the work and then we'll discuss U*sa matters.
C T lt P es ^ l3Sues u^elated to the existing iSreat peaw posed by Soviet pl tes and missile in Cuba.
Probably needed for a revolt in NATO that ' Bundy : Well I fc ve also talked to Finletter and asked him to dieck the Penrreps and soy ttiat the United States stands for this position but if t)iO NATO countries should feel that it places tfion in unusual hazard, lie is authorized to elicit their points of view stir then on that point, t Taylor : we tiave sate more information on the afternoon flight, Mr, Secretary , Ihese planes took off at 1541.
There were four in the afternoon flight, the planes took off at 1541 , , One developed mechanical trouble so a pair turned back., (words unclear} approach the Qiban coast in three flight plans.
The President asks what kind of fire was received and the answer is not clear.
There follows low and apparently less general conversation including a discussion, not very audible , by Risk of possible public coHment on the off-course U-2 over t}*e Soviet Union.
JFK : I think we're better off not to do it if we can get away with not having sere leak.
But I t3Ank — I think our problem is to maintain our credibility with iQirushchev.
Mr President, may 1 say in relation to -that, 1 think if we haven't announced already, and I knew we haven't we shouldn't nv. one of our afternoon aircraft was hit by a 37 millimeter shell.
One is, do we want to have these conversations go on, on Turkey and these other natters while there's a sort of standstill in Cuba., or do we want to say that we won't talk about Turkey and these ether matters until they've settled the Cuban crisis* I think t}rf*se are {words unclear* questions.
That puts us in a nuch stronger world position because most people will think his offer is rather reasonable.
I tlink we ought to put our emtfisis right now on the fact that we want an indication from him in the next twenty-four hours that he's going to stand still an* disarm these weapons.
But I think tl.at If we don't say that he's going to say we rejected his offer, and therefore he's going to have public opinion with him.
So I think our only liope to escape from that is to say that we insist that he stand still.
Now we don't think he'll do that, and therefore we're in much better shape to put our case on that than ratlier that Turkey's irrelevant, {Pause, 15 seconds, then low voices, 20 seconds) JFK; Ya, 1 think we ought to say ""if"" his proposal, She proposal made by the Soviet Union broadcast — this would be to the Secretary General — this morning involved a nuntoer of countries and een^licated issues not directly related to the existing threat to peace posed by Soviet offensive missile bases in Cuba.
The United States would be glad to discuss this matter with you and others after consultation with the itBftkers of Nhid, whose interests are also involved.
I think that — we'll all Join in doing this if it's the decision, but 1 think we should tell you that that's the universal assessment of everyone in the gjovernrrent that' £ connected with these alliance problems.
That the knockdown in this tftdte House statement this morning was well received.
JgC; Yes, but 1 should say t^t also, as the situation is moving, Mac, If we don't for the next twenty-four or forty-eight hours, this trade has appeal.
Now the only thing we've got fox which I would think we'd be able to hold general support would be — well let's try to word it so tJjit we don't harm KATO — but the tiling tlit I think everybody would agree to — while these matters, which are complicated, are discussed, tl*ere should be a cessation of work.
Whan you separate out,:, McHamara i Couldn't we Just add in there, ""Inasmuch as they relate to -uhyou want to make it the entire issue of HMO,, not just Turkey* That's clear, {voices) inasmuch as they relate to the defense of NHO, bases in Italy t Turkey, the UJC and elsewhere — then you go on* So you link it all together and you — and you take away tte attention from Turkey, In that case I don't see anything wrong with it.
McNaTimra repeats his point, to get away frm specific reference to Turkey.
JFK i I just talked to General Norstad* He thinks that we Ought to have a meeting of the NATO Council tomorrow morning to present this to tiiem so that tliey all have a pioca of it.
Otherwise no matter what we do — if we don't take it, we're blama!, if we do take it, we're just as blamed* very right.
And I think the united States position ought to be that here it is, and we ought to Lave the — uh <— if we dcn s t take it what the prospects will be r as well as what we do.
It's probably obvious tltat Uiey made a suggestion about Turkey which tins HMO Council would t* interested in meeting about* Bundy : 1 don't think there's any pain in the meeting.
The possibility is if you wait twenty-four hours and s*e if tfyey accept this otlfir thing {words unclear) accept it yet.
T^WBsonr If you have a NMO nee ting, I gather from some word we've had frcm Italv, the Italians are likely to core up with a proposal to wit>.draw the bases there, the missiles there, I don't know if we ever got ti*at message.
As 1 was preparing this letter let me (words unclear) many countries and complicated issues not related to Cuba and tlie Western Hemisphere.
Hie United states would be glad to discuss these matters with you and otl^r governments concerned* T.*a immediate crisis is in Cuba, and it is there that (words unclear} is necessary.
I'm not 9011*3 to get Into that before Dlllont If you^hava a Council meeting you* 11 prcbably get a strong reaction frm a great many of the members of NftTG against our taking ar.y action in Cuba.
Btactly, (lew voices} ^amara Mr, President, I wander if we sJiould not take certain actions with respect to the Jupiters in Turkey and Italy before we act in Cuba.
If we decided to take that action with respect to the jup iters in Turkey end Italy before we acted in Cuba, then we could tell NKTO tliat at tiie time we talked to them about ttds proposal tron Khrushchev and our response to it.
I don't think we can nrake any United attacks when they're shooting at our reconnaissance aircraft because we would — we would not dare to 90 in with the kind of lifted attack that we've been thinking about the last twenty-four hours without taking out their SrM-sites* The trcment we take out the SAMr sites and the MIC airfields we're up to the * sao* sortie program* If we send 500* sorties in against Cuba, we oust be prepared to follow up with an invasion in about * seven* days.
If we start out on that kind of a program, it seems to me the Soviets are very likely to feel forced to reply with military action some place, particularly if tliese missiles — Jupiter missiles — are still in Turkey, We might be able to either shift the area in which they would apply their military force or give them no excuse to apply military force by taking out the Turkish Oupiters and the Italian Jupiters before we attack Cuba.
He would dtuxed voices J We've already detected three submarines off the S coast in the last forty-eight hours.
How they — as far as we knew they den't carry missiles, but that's just tjappenstance.
HcKanara ; I think, I think we could, first place we can tell them (words unclear) 3FKi If we took tliem out, we'd get tl»a trade the Russians have offered us.
Bund^j it could lead the Soviet Union to cane back to the ne&t problem.
Uh — they say they're going to discontinue tlie work on the bases, they can either accept our proposal , or they can reject t}*e proposal and say we still want Turkey for Cuba, they reject the proposal and say they want Turkey for Cuba but they're going to discontinue the work on the bases, then I would think would be the tire to have -~ bring KMO in and say, ""TUFTs the proposal.
He haven't lost anything, and they've discontinued tta work on t>.e bases.
W + — if they say they're going to continue the work on the bases, I think then we've got to decide whether — if they Mve said by tomorrow morning they're going to continue the work on tJie basis — whether we should Lave a military stride.
JHtj It's going to be — You see, they haven't had the alternatives presented to them.
They'll say, -well God, we don't want to trade then °f f * % "" *n'f realize that in two or t)^ee days we may have a military strike whitf. could bring perhaps tte seizure of Berlin or a strike on Turkey, and then they'll say ""By God we should Lave taken it.
If tomorrow we don't have a favorable answer from u Thant or IQkrushchev to this message that's going out now, is it iirportant to strike tomorrow or do we have sores more time.
On the otlter hand,, Mr* President* if KftTO seems solid on this, tliis Ids a chance of shaking KhrusheJ^ev off tJ*is point* Martin * Suppose that we give him a letter which ia addressed to Ms letter of yesterday and ask U Thant to release than both — he* 3 the fellow to release them — and then he releases correspondence *tkich consists really of an offer ft™ Khrushcliev and we — we come back and write.
Kartin s Perhaps we'll say. ""thank you* Yes*"" find it doesn't mention Turkey.
Well, I tliink tl*at he'd probably just say tljat tl*e work's going on* U-at we're not going to take these — tfit we're not interested in this deal* then I think we're going to have to do something — 1 don't tlink he has to say that it is — but the escalation is going to go on, and we think ti*is is very likely, that tfkere would be sore reprisal against possibly Turkey and possibly against Berlin, and we should be aware of that.
What we don't want is to l*ave a cheap torndown by t**m r witl^out realizing that tike turndown puts us in the position of then having to do sane tiling* What we're doing to be faced with is — because we wouldn't take the missiles out of Turkey, then maybe we'll have to invade or make a massive strike on Cuba which may lose Berlin * TTiat's wtj>t concerns inc.
We want to reduce your danger while at the sam* time maintaining your defense.
We propose that you defuse those missiles tonight, we'reputting Polaris submarines along your coast* We* 11 cover the same targets that your Jupiter missiles did, and we 1 11 announce this to tl*e world before we invade Cuba ami thereby wtttld reduce the pressure On the Soviet Union to attack you* Turkey, as a response to our invasion Of Cuba.
Bundy ; well we haven't tried the block — tte enlargement of tl,e blockade* we haven't even thought about it for Kme hours* and it + s been on my mird a good deal* POL we still have to.
I'm just thinking about what What we're going to have to do in a day or so. tfdA is* soo * sorties and * e ™* J 8 ^'.™ iosaibly an invasion, all because *e wouldn't taKe m^a^ c^t of Turkey and we all knew how quickly everybody's course goes when the bleed starts to flow, and that's what's tp** to Ue^ i* NfO, wt«i they these things, and they grab Berlin, and everybody's going to say, ""Well tUt vfaTa pretty geed pro^ition.
Bundv MeU, I'm not cure — because I tfkink — let s speculate with J SIs Mr President, If you have ttot conviction, and you are yourself sure that — uh — tUs is the way want — the best way out — U»en I would say that an frtnediate personal telegram was tf.fi best thiAg 3FE^°"" Well T don't think we accept it.
What I think you'd have to do iTget the Turks to agree accepting it over their ccposit ion and over NATO opposition I tl,ink would be I'd rat>.er 90 the total blockade route, which isTa lesser step tf^Ttf.e military action, wuit x'd like to do is liave the Turks and NMD equally («1 that this is tte wise move.
Rusk; Bear in mind that; our ~ bearing in mind tf.at our specific arrangements have already been set forth in He* York to U Tbant.
Stevenson has suggested a letter l«ere that may not be bad in this parties C ° lltfiXt "" ""I have read your letter of October 2Gth with great care and find it an indication of a willingness on your part to seek a calm solution of the problan.
The first tldng that needs to be done, however, is for work to cease on offensive missile bases in Cuba, and all weapons systems in Cuba capable of offensive use rendered inoperable.
Assuring this is done promptly — we re likely to hear somettung about U V. action now.
I therefore most earnestly urge you to join Us in a rapid settlement of the Cuban crisis as your letter of October 26th suggests is possible, so that we can tl*en 90 on to an early solution o£ other serious problems which I am convinced are not insoluble.
Let's get ttis settled first, and. we'll. . . (mijiod voices} Rusk t to T*ave a letter in tLand though, which would give him a chance to work it out without relation to Turkey.
JFKi This is to Khrushchev Busk ; Bo, he wanted a eopv of a latter to W.rushchev, That does not really make ituch of a point on the Turkish point.
Otherwise it's about the sama. {low voices) JFK; TT^ point Of the matter is Khrushchev' s going to cone back and refer to his thing this morning On Turkey.
And tJ^n we're going to be screwing around for another forty-eight hours, 1 think what we've got to do is say &tst we've got to make the key of this letter the cessation of work.
So tihen we're on until Monday afternoon, and the work goes on, and we haven't had a chance to specif ically get his good faith on the cessation of work.
So I think we ought to make that the key question — tl* cessation Of work.
Let's go with this letter, Mr* Secretary* Let's start with our letter to let's efcart with that, because otherwise we'll never get an answer.
Ho* tJ.e only problem with this letter again on page 3 is 1p when we get agreement on Cuba,"" which he TEfiFt aoinq to give us* He's now moved on to the Turkish thing so we're ■just going to get^ letter back saying ""well we'll be glad tfi settle Turkey if settle —settle Cuba if we'll settle T\n*ty.
So I think we have to make the crucial point in this letter, witftfut opening up Turkey, ia the question will he, at least in the mutt t*enty-feur .mrs, while we discuss all these natters, will >,e agree with me to stop the work on tlfi bases.
Tint's tt* only thing we can, because we have — because he either has to say Ves or Wo, If says No to that, then we're — at least have — we have scire indication.
Take — take out paragraph 1 and put it in the end* Make that — that isn't part of the deal.
Right* jFjH Then we would get into discussion of all those matters. ycNamarat Right* Bu^v i But 1 tt Jnk that that ought to {words unclear) be made as a separate matter in the letter. , ' , _ u BMensens I just raise tl.e question to make sure that we do insist on TO ^i£ication H because 1 understand iron the Etefense Department wa could verify it by ourselves, and even, tliey say.

Well let's see what he comes back with here* I Itiean I dm't think we^re going to get as much {words unclear) but I mean let' s cake it as reasonable as possible.
See if you don't think that you could use Rdlai — his draft at3""put in the specific things down there where the arrow is* JFK j Yeah, Jds second paragraph is useful.
Just put in ""this to be verify — this to be satisfactorily verified — this to be verified under — well, right.
Klyat Adlai says about what to do about Turkey — another problem is pretty 9°cd{pause) JFK: Tl.fi only thing is — what he's saying is that they've got to get the weapons out of Cuba before we'll discuss the general detente.
No*e're not going to be able to effect that, He doesn't agree with that.
Let a couple Of United States 4a out and try to put the specifics of this letter in {words unclear) with the paragraphs of fiaiai.
It seems to me what we ought to ~ to be reasonable* We're not going to get these weapons out of Cuba, probably, any«ayBut I mean — by negotiation. — we're going to have to take our weapons cut of Turkey.
I don't think there's any doubt he's not going to {word unclear) now tl«it be made that public.
JFK ; fill right, what about at the end of this, we use this letter and say ""will be a grave risk to peace.
Otherwise time — uh — slips away on us. {words unclear and mixed voices) Sorenseni in other words , Mr President, your position is that once he meets ttli's cofrfition of the — uh — halting of the work and tJ.e inoperability, you're then prepared to 90 ahead on eitJicr the specific Cuban track or what we call the general detente track.
He must be a little shaken up or ha woulda' t have sent the message to you in the first place.
Yeah, but I mean — so that you can — it's certainly conceivable tha""t you could get him back to that. -(words unclear} I don't thijik we ghould abandon » » » J7YWell, I think Adlai's letter all right than.

Stevenson's proposal is that we release this letter, tlds letter be released, in order to get this bock on the Cuban tracfc, end away iron, the focus away frtu lis letter.
There's 901119 to be a hell of a fight about that* I don't mind taking it on if we're going to get Ecmo^hcre.
Such discussion ■ JFK: Turkey and — uh — I'd like to say that the United States.
Ho, he just tied it into Turkey* The difficulty is we're not ready tordgiit, WgCtmg s wo, I know, but — uh — tfiis morning before I studied that letter, because I hadn't seen a copy of it, I was under the impression that his reference to Turkey was just sort of an exanple of.
JlrK; That's right, we have to keep it vague, unfortunately r or fortunately, because we haven't cleared it with Turkey of t&ao.
T don't understand — can 1 just say — what's wrong — uh — what about all the points ttiat we made in this letter.
T^ifi reason for the — the actual reason we didn f t have those points in this letter was ttie President's desire not to get Ms hands too tied with respect to ttie Turkish problem.
At flb we undertake to give assurance with respect to the territorial integrity and independence of Cuba... sorensen: WO, we changed that.
Send tJJ.e Tetter and say you're accepting liis offer — he's made an offer and you're in fact accepting it.
And you think — I tl*ink that letter sounds slightly defensive about the fact — Ged r don't bring in Turfcey new; we want to settle — we're not — I don 1 t know w}yether it adds anything, I mean I think this letter — he made an offer last night.
No, I thought we said we'd not to invade Cuba* That's the language he asked for JFK i That's correct, but I don't think, if we're going to make this public at this point j when we don't know how much we're going to get, we don't want to get in that far.
KFK s Be cause I think* one, its just in general terms, rather defensive, and is just says we don't want to get in — please don't into discussion of HATO* ox Turkey r because we want to talk about Cuba, The other tone says, ""T0U made an offer to US, and we accept it,"" and you've also made a second offer which has to do with NATO j and we 1 11 be glad to discuss that at a later time.
The other first letter — of Adlai — I don't think says anything, l don't think we're any further along, except we don't like you — what you said, (pause} Sorcnscn t It may be possible to take elements of his* part of ours.
RFKs 1 wouldn't repeat about the HMO thing twice* (Words unci earl ¥ou h ve got it once, twice, I think it sounds rather defensive about this has really thrown us off by the fact that you've brought this thing up.
Mr Kennedy** ~ JFK ; jn other words you want to — you have to get them to say we accept your proposal* PFK: accept it and then say you — I just the last paragraph of the other letter and however way you phrase it.
It does look now froa a military point of view What are the reason.,, Taylor i They just feel that the longer we wait now.
Bundjr; Ho, we have a long message in from Hare, which arrived this afternoon r in which he responds to the message sent to him on Wednesday at great length, {nixed voices) that he'll do his damnedest but it's very difficult, which is in essence what he — the way it comes outf.
JFK i Well now we have the question of a choice between the Bilateral arrangement with Turkey — in which we more or less do it, or whether we go through HATO and let NATO put the pressure on, and also explain to the Turks what's going to happen to then if it does — if they end up slow in this matter.
If you're going to deal directly with the Turks, the President simply sends a message to the Prime Minister and says this is the problem and this is the way 1 think it ought to be solved, and I'm prepared to do it tonight.
And I need an answer front you within six hours — or eight hours — something like that.
JFK 1 You want to do it — if we're going to that, Bob, and that may be the way we ought to do it — the effect of that, of course, 1 don't know how you — not having had it explained in NATO what's going to be the effects of continuing with it it's going to look like we're uh -caving in.
Do we want to have a meeting in the morning of HATO and say, ""If we don 1 1 do it, hare t s the problem. (mixed voices} voice ' I think you have to do it simultaneously.
We have to get ground up to do it t and we have to look at some of the actions in between.
I talked to Captain (name not clear J — there T s some difference — I think you have to wait until a little later.
Either we decide not to send them in at all or we decide to send them in with proper cover* If we send them in with proper cover and they're attacked, we must attack back, either the 5AM s and /or Kl<* aircraft that come against them, or the ground firs that coir.es up.
When you put the two of these together ~ the question of — you know stopping surveillance and not stopping the ship — it seems to me we're too weak*** Voice: Tfeah, yeah« Taylor ; I*d say we must continue surveillance* That 1 s far more important than the Ship.
Mcttamara ; Well — uh — my main point is I don't think at this particular point we should — tih — show a weakness to Khrushchev J and I think we would show a weakness if we — if we failed on both Of these actions.
Taylor ; And we must not fail on surveillance* we can't give up twentyfour hours at this stage.
McMamara; Well, we can't send these low — we can't send these low -altitude aircraft in JFK; If you're going tc) take a reprisal — the cover isn't much good because you've got antiaircraft guns.
J would think we ought to take a chance on reconnaissance tomorrow, without the cover , because 1 don*t think cover's really going to do you much good.
One or the other » JFK; I'm rather inclined to think that the more general response-** However, why don't we wait.
Hell that's what I want to come to now, Mow let's think over the Turkish thing.
Well that's what we cuocEsteo to Hare* {words unclear)* well, but that's what we wexe talking about doing.
We ought to send out to the Turks that this is their neck, of course they re liable to say, ""Well, we can take it,"" So we*ve got to have it j look to the general interest T and a more effective defense for you.
He"" have — that's the way 1 interpret the Turkish position now and also a couple of years ago, Ru3k; When we talked about Polaris in place of the missiles, the Turkish reaction was the missiles are here, and as long as they're here you're here.
Well I tell ycu there's a few club members of NATO who won t like it much.
Host of the HATO members aren't going to be very happy about it, because the problem is Berlin or something.
The British have recognised the obsolescence of the Thor and have decided to take it out and replace it with other systems of which Polaris i£ an effective one.
And we propose the same thing be done for Turkey, * Voice i And Italy too Kctiamara t And Italy tool exactly.
JFK; well, thev will, as I say, it's bound to be looked on though as~the United States — they'll say that this is because the United States — to make a trade.
Sure, That's exactly right, 1 mixed voices) MgKamara: we have our air squadrons there with nuclear weapons.
There's at least as much,.* jfk i We want — in other words, Bob, we want to send a message to our ambassador to begin this track, some message to NATO what the facts of life are, You see they don't kno* what's coming *P(pause} It's not going to b* so Slppy.
I think~we can defer an air attack on Cuba until Wednesday or Thursday, but only ii we continue our surveillance and -and — uh — fire against anything that fires against the surveillance aircraft, and only if we maintain a tight blockade in this interim period.
That's just exactly— in fact, I don't think we can, (Voices unc 1 ear 1 Taylor : (words unclear] It's on the ground the wreckage is on the ground.
Bundy t If we know it, it must be either on friendly land or on the water.
Hccongi 1 wonder if this shouldn't cause a most violent protest a letter right to Khrushchev.
Here's, here's an action they T ve taken against « against us, a new order in defiance of — of public statements he made. think that.
McCone ; If there's any continuation of this, we just take those SAMsites out of there.
Secretary, unless we can reeonnoiter — reconnoiter each day, (words unclear) reconnaissance.
McHamara t And if we're going to reconnaissance, carry out surveillance , each day,> we must be prepared to fire each day.
Havana's announced it anyway* You ought to announce it*** Voices * Yeah.
It would certainly make it more difficult* jfk: I think we ought to announce that — uh — that — uh — action is being taken — action will be taken to protect our MC^amara: Exactly.
I haven't the detail* {Mixed voices) Taylor : ' They started the shooting.
General -get a statement which would cover in any case* It may be — wa don't know it was shot down.
HcHarciara ; That's right, exactly JFKi They say — uh — that's why I'd like to find out whether Havana says they did shoot it down.
We assume these E^M-sites are manned by Soviets. voice : That's the significant part if it is the SAH-site.
This is a change of pattern, now why it's a change of pattern we don't know.
RFKi Yeah. voice * The important thing to find out if we possibly can is whether this was a SftM-site.
In operation, McNamara t Which was r squired for control of the missiles.
McHaraara t And it was in operation, we believe, at the same tipie that the U-2 was over.
You could have an undisciplined anti-aircraft Cuban anti-aircraft outfit fire, but to have a SAM-tite and a Russian crew fire is not any accident.
Voices If he had altitude and had any type of a failure, he could fly to Puerto Eico.
That's why I think we'd better have a tiATO meeting tomorrow, , T Dillons JFK t Explain the thing, + where we are — uh ~ I T m just afraid of wEaVs going to happen in HATO, to Europe, when we get into this thing more and more, and I think they ought to feel that they ve a part of it* Even if we don't do anything about the Turks, they ought to feel that they kno* what*.McBamara i I would agree r but I think we ought to know what we want NATO to do tomorrow, which means that we have to have a proposition.
They 1 re going to be fifteen voices without instructions • HcNamara: Without instruction from the governments, so that... voice : — Actually what we should do tonight, Mr President, not only ""get a message to NATO but get to the capitals, to our ambassadors so they can talk to the governments, because these Permanent Representatives won't be able to do anything.
And in the message to the capitals say we arc doing it, and that wc want the Representatives to be instructed JFK t Of course it would be relatively easy if we wanted to get NATO to reject this thing, but that isn + t necessarily what w& want right now.
Voice i That's right Mc^amara i When we decide that, I think we can force it, and I think we can do it in such a way that the aftereffects will not — not be too severe.
Bu ndy i To free our hands in Cuba we must get these missiles out of Turkey, is what wc say.
Bundy i It will be seen as a trade by a great many people, Mr President.
If you don't buy that, then it seens to me Bob has the beet way of dealing with it* JTKt Hell what we'd like to do is have the Turks come and offer ^thTs.
We just have One last line, Mr President , that Bobby thought you ought to look at.
Provided that NftTG agrees, KcHamara; I was going to say, we can play it on an either/or basis , We can say we're in a position where we believe we're going to have to attack Cuba.
And ""if they don't take it, we feel they should recognise the danger, accept the danger, (mixed voices} KcHamara : Let's try to work that out* OFKThin will be for a meeting tomorrow.
I would not do it tomorrow, Mr President, myself,52 JTKj I tlink we ought to get something {words unclear) tomorrow afternoon.
The only time we say that we render then inoperable is when we've determined that we're going to attack in Cuba.
Voices And save a ffew hundred thousand miles* McWamara i Let me start my proposition over again* We must be in a position to attack, quickly* We've been fired on today, We're going to send surveillance aircraft in tomorrow* Those are going to be fired on without question.
We're going to lose airplanes r and we* 11 be shooting up Cuba quite a bit, but we're going to losa airplanes every day.
So we must he prepared to attack Cuba — quickly* That's the first proposition* Now the second proposition.
Now I'm not sore we can avoid anything like that, if *e attack Cuba, but I think we should make every effortto avoid it, and one way to avoid it is to defuse the Turkish missiles before we attack Cuba.
I thinX you're in a position where you've gotten rid of your missiles for nothing ■ HcNamara: Well, wait a minute, I did't say it saved you from a reprisal.
Ball * Well, taut what a ood does that do you Ictlon against Berlin, or somewhere else, Imixed voices) v HcHamarat You have to go back in my proposition and say ii there aren't Jupiter missiles in Turkey to attack, they're going to employ military force elsewhere, I'm not — I'm not at all certain of that.
Mcflamara t I said I thought It was the r&alistic solution to the problem LBJi Sure TmTxed voices) lb j t What we were afraid of was he* a never offer this, but what he'd want to do was trade Berlin . voices This was just the kind of thing McNamgra i I'm not opposed to it, now, all I'm suggesting is, don't push lis into a position where we haven't traded it and we are forced to attack Cuba, and the missiles remain in Turkey.
That's all I'm suggestingLet's avoid that position, we're fast moving into that.
Biindy r We were going to let him have his strike in Turkey, as I understood it last week. ~~ at one point at least that was the way we talked about it.
Ball s what — actually t what we were thinking last week was that what he was doing was . we thought that if we could, trade it out for Turkey this would be an easy trade and a very advantageous deal.
Well, I would far rather — if we're going to get the damned missiles out of Turkey anyway , say, we T ll trade you the missiles, we're going to put Jupiters — I mean we f re going toput Polaris in there, you're not going to benefit by this — but we will , if this is a matter of real concern to you, to have these on your borders , all right, we'll get rid of them, you get rid of them in Turkey -in, in Cuba.
Yeah* Infixed voices) rtcKamara: Well, I think you have two alternatives tmixed voices) Bnndy : I missed your statement : I have to aek you to say it again.
I'd say j sure, we'll accept your offer, if this ia a matter of grave concern to you, and you equate these t Ling 5, which we don't but if you do, ok, we can work it out.
Before we attack Cuba we're going to reduce the danger to Turkey to a minimum, Bundv ; I'd like to see both of these messages written.
But Mac, this other course will in a sense be that, so — let's get first the message written on the assumption that.
It*s going to go to the Turks, to the heads of government of NATO countries , and the Worth Atlantic Council — same message in effect.
We probably ought to think about the course of action in the next two or three days, what we're going to (words Unclear and other noises! Max is going bach to work out the surveillance problem for tomorrow with the Chiefs and see how much cover we need and so on.
We can carry this on I would think a couple of days, maybe three days, possibly even four, But we're going to lose planes.
You know, it seems to me we're missing a bet hero. think that we ought to take this case to — send: directly to Khrushchev by fast wire the nest violent protest, and demand that he — that Tie stop this business and stop it right away, or we're going to take those SAWsites out immediately , That's what I'd tell him, I'd tell him this is a — I'd just use one of the messages he sends us, and I'd send it right off, and if he won't -and I'd trade these Turkish things out right now* I wouldn't even talk to anybody about it.
We sat for a week j and everybody was in favor of doing it, and I'd make that part of the message.
If he wants to sit down and talk about this thing, he can call off his gunfire and do it right away.
Mot once — there isn't a single word in it that proposes to take the missiles out.
Well hia message this morning wasn't..* (mixed voices} McNamara : well, no, I'm speaking of the last-night message ~ The last-night message was twelve pages of fluff.
And before we got the damned thing read the whole deal changed — complete 1y changed.
All of which leads me to conclude that the probabilities are that nothing's going to fee signed quickly, Now my question is, assuming nothing is signed quickly, what do we do.
Now John's suggestion, I think, is obviously one — to try to negotiate a deal* Mccone i I wouldn't try to negotiate a deal.
I'd send him a threatening letter, I'd say, you've made public an offer, tfo 1 11 accept that offer.
But you shot down a plane today before we even had a chance to send you a letter t despite the fact that you knew that we were sending unarmed planes on a publicly announced surveillance.
Now we're telling you f Mr Khrushchev, this just one tiling, that we're sending unarmed planes over Cuba.
If one of them is shot at, we're going to take the installations out, and you can expect it.
Mo i I wouldn't because then the pressure get's (word unclear) he get another* proposal* Ke'll have Berlin thrown in. [low voices McCane t He'll get something else thrown in tomorrow.
Let's go down <and try and draft, get this (words unclear) just so we have later tonight 6 one alternative here.
There follows sporadic lowvoiced conversation until Rusk re turn Sj and the vice President and Rusk and Dillon begin to talk with each other.
After a routine review for Johnson of the public steps of the day so far, the conversation continues after comments on the surveillance problem that are not clear,} LBJ i I've been afraid of these damned flyers ever since they mentioned them.
Just an ordinary plane goin' in there at two or three hundred feet without arms or an announcment.
If they get — four of them had to turn back because of Imagine some crazy Russian captain would be looking (words unclear) our skies.
I*m scared oJE that, and I don't see — I don't see what you get for that photograph that's so roach more important than what you — you know they're working at night 7 you see them working at night.
Psycho logically you scare them* Well, Hell, it's like the fellow telling me in Congress, ""Go on and put the monkey on his back*"" Every time I tried to put a monkey on somebody else's back I got one. if you* re going to try to psycho logically scare them with a Clare you're liable to get your bottom shot at.
He's drafting* LEJ; He He says that if you're going to — you ought to accept the trade if you're going to give up the Turkish bases, that you ought to say, ok, we'll give them up for Cuba.
There are two sides[words unclear} tfcNamara says if we're going to hit Cuba, we've got to say to the Turks that we want you to give uo your Jupiters, and we'll give you Polaris Instead* Ball said, well if you're going to do that, just say to Mr Khrushchev, Yes to your proposal today.
Dillon ; Here is the third thing which is really the Ball line, plus Mccone's ultimatum idea about surveillance, < reading) Hr.
Your forcesn Cuba have fired on our unarmed planes conducting surveillance in acc or dance with the resolution of the OAS* You have done this before 1 had an opportunity to reply to your letter of this morning* offering to remove your offensive weapons from Cuba in return for the removal of similar weapons fro* TurkeyThis suggestion of yours requires consultation with our NATO allies. 1 am undertaking such consultation and am recommending that our allies agree to the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Turkey at the same time that your missiles are removed from Cuba.
Meanwhile it is essential that these weapons be made inoperable immediately.
Until this is done, subject to reasonable international control, we must continue our unarmed aerial surveillance in Cuba* If these planes — or again these unarmed planes — he keeps saying that --if these unarmed planes are again fired upon, we will be required to respond with all the necessary force.
The decision, Hr, chairman, is yours, if you give orders to your forces in Cuba to cease interference with our unarmed planes , if you agree — uh — to immediately render the offensive weapons in Cuba inoperable, the way to peace is open.
They see that there are &cme ships coming through* There f s a great feeling of insecurity. told you the other day before these fellows came in they're reflecting it.
We've got 17,000 men there * LB J ; {words unclear) So we could say f we're going to come but we^ve got to hit Cuba, and we think that you're in less danger by pulling down these Jupiter s and getting them out of here and having the Polaris than you are in eye. other way.
Dillon ; if you do this — if you at the same time send that message to everybody, you see, which is explaining why, which is the message that's being drafted* LfiJi I think goverments are old and tired and sick.
We're just calking about missiles F because we can't talk about planes.
Oh 1 see, what you were talking about a week ago was that they'd take everything out of Cuba r and we'd just take the missiles out of Turkey,, whereas now he's saying I'll take missiles out of Cuba, ypu take missiles out of here.
Either Ki.ru sKehev was overruled and — or Khrushchev and /or his eollegues were deceived by the Lippmann piece and the fact that Krai sky put this out which made then think that we were putting this out, that we were willing to — to make a trade.
Well, Lippmann can worh this thing differently, It's our position to say unless you agree not to shoot at our unarmed planes until these things of yours are inoperable in Cuba, then we're going to have to hit you.
The choice is yours, A confused discussion of Lippmann' s position follows, largely mixed voices* 63 ThoiKpBPii i These boys are beginning to give way, Let's push harder.
Dillon ; Well, would you rather send them a thing like this which says if they shoot at all you're going to take them all out, or would you rather just go in and take one SAK-site out.
Well, a decision was made after the first letter* The first letter he was wobbling around rather slowly, (words unclear) but that is not to be ignored, f pro longed mixed voices) Then there is read, probably by Mccone, a longer version of the Mccone draft letter.
I'm surprised that they've baen allowing these planes to go in all these days anyway without any action. [words unclear) Now if we pull out for the last couple of davs in the papers.
Thompson ; The only thing that bothers me at all about it is the — uh — you can see that we have two conflicting things here; One is to prepare for action in Cuba, and the other is to get a peaceful solution along the lines which he has proposed, ftnd the purposes are conflicting because if we want to get him to accept the thing that he put in his letter last night, then we shouldn't give any indicaton that *e J re ready to talk about the Cuba -Turk ish thing.
Thompson i The action, And I think to mention, as MeCone does, that we can discuss this other thing, may be to give them a churlish bona fit — and it's an embarrassment r in effect, to Khrushchev.
This is missile to missile ftnd technician to technician and plane for plane.
Because if we get that Out in public, I think that offsets a lot of things we're at present about the public posture.
I'm sorry to keep you. think we ought to go — essentially go back to this problem and then when we get these messages to the Turks r the British, and the NATO messages.
We have to go back to — wc have to instruct Finletter, weTave really to agree on the track, you see, Mr President and 1 think there's a very substantial difference of opinion* LBJ: HcKanara is drafting that message, JFK: Let's see what the difference is, and then we can think about that.
Bund^i Well I haven't been in as much of the discussion as some others, Mr President, but I'll ask Mr Thompson to speak.
It gets it back on — centered on Cuba, and our willingness to accept it. ftnd that that somewhat diminished the need for any talk about — about Turkey.
And we'ra going to hit Cuba and therefore we ought to do this because then it means that you ' re safer than you would be.
Ball takes the position that you shouldn't — you should get something for your trade, if you're going to give up the Jupiter, why you ought to get him to take care of Cuba, LB J a McCone's got one that lays down an ultimatum, that just says wi^re going to — you shot down our man there, we're not going to take any more Of it.
Mr, President, I think that the trouble with Ball's l^k is thai Public M today plane for plane, man forman, missile for aiissile.
Va can*t very well invade Cuba with all its toil, arid long as it's agoing to be, when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles in Turkey.
If that's part of the record I don't see how we T ll have a very good war.
He takes his wissiies out of Cuba, he takes his men out of Cuba, he takes his planes out of Cuba, why then your whole foreign policy is gone.
This Turkey thing has been Words unclear) Vaicre i ... get these missiles out of there.
We have sofhe photography and I would say by tonight — by the end of the day — we probably have seen some of the dispositions around these sites » However the kind of very hard to pick up.
Me think , however j the Chiefs would re comma nd, that we still 90 back witty about six planes tomorrow, picking out targets which we don't know have this kind of flak around, to verify that the work is still going ahead, and also to prove we're still On the job.
But we're approaching the point, I think r Mr President j where low -level reconnaissance will be entirely impossible, when we reach that point, and if we're going to continue reconnaissance without actually taking out the whole works P we're faced with taking out a number of the SAMsites that medium and high-level reconnaissance.
I would add to that I don't believe we should carry out tomorrow's u-2 mission The U-2 but 1 do believe we should carry out the low-level reconnaissance with the necessary fighter escorts and preparations for following our reconnaissance, if it's attacked, with attack on the attackers.
Otherwise what we're going to do is find this build-up of the of the protection for the SAMsites, low r and the SAMsites high — and we'll find ourselves without — our requirement will be so limited, that we'll find ourselves with all the disadvantages.

I thought tomorrow we H d do that* It's just a little late tonight, and I think probably tomorrow, JFK j what we'd better do is now figure out these messages to NATO and the Turks.
I just talked to Fin letter, who is arranging for the tcac meeting in the morning.
He might be instructed to give details of Khrushchev's communication to you, to state that regardless of the merit or lack of merit of the proposal, the seriouness of the situation requires , Finletter's presentation should be brief, factual and should be cool and skeptical, without suggesting that you have established a firm and final position* The resulting discussion would r I hope, be useful to you as an indication of European opinion, and might develop some aspects of the problem of importance to you in making your 74 decision.
In any event it should help to avoid a situation in which you can be ^rong whatever you do, and your allies can be rig lit and wise regardless of development s, It also of course helps meet the consultation commitment * No matter how productive and useful a NAC discussion may be it will no 1 , I fear r substantially relieve you of the burden of making a difficult decision.
There is one — we have one on the basis that — uh — ■, Husk: Mr* President, T wonder, in a matter of this sort, whether it is necessary for the United States to give its first choice at the time that we first discuss this problem with fiftC. we could let them know that we've got to take action in Cuba if this thing continues, and this will create dangers in the NATO area.
Remind them that the Soviets have raised this question of Turkey* We 1 d genuinely like to consult Europe — the NATO allies.
Therefore we have to stand by them in NATO and make sure that — uh — the Soviet union realises that we have to combine with NATO on this issue.
Well, if you're going to really present it to them that way, Tcu wouldn't want to state a position, I don't think, Mr* Secretary, woU xd you, because they'll feel compelled then to aqree with that — it sounds sort of strong and firm and clear, and t*en they — uh — unless we're sure that's the direction we want to steer them* I think we can steer them in that direction.
It's officially the easiest position, but I think we ought to be sure that that's what w* want to do.
AnE if we don't — take it, then we want everybody to understand what we think may be the alternative U we're going to have to move.
I think that's probably what this first meeting ought to be, and then we might have another one the nest morning.
We IX now, will the introduction of Turkey, we think that if we~take an action which we may have to take, I don't think we ought to say — which we may well have to take the way it's escalating, if they hit Turkey and they tiit Berlin, we want them —if they want to get off, now"" a the time to speak up.
But if we are hard on this thing — the gains that we have we know that we've got some respite — that (words unclear} see some way in Moscow — the way that they made the offer initially, why don't we just wait another eighteen hours, see if that's been eased at all* we 1 re hard and tough on this* We called up the planes tonight* and we wait.
Lri£ Item 42.2, Raftrenca Reel 2 RFK ; T think you could say it tomorrow, if you had the information.
You could do it — Ok* Well ~ uh — one day r I can't believe it's going to make that much difference, (voices unclearl PTKi I think — I think you've got to give them a chance.
Put the situation to then and welcome their views on it. tend to hope that they night have some ideas about the alternatives.
Mr President it n s only seven hours to the meeting I don't Soransen ; It's essentially Kes's draft, and there's one paragraph dropped.
But I think you can say that we won't that we r re going to ask for a meeting on Monday on it.
Eiot whether we're continuing or Cilpatric i we've already announced that, that we're going to continue.
Well, I was thinking abcut that ship, because we're going to lie"" faced with the problem Of that ship tomorrow.
From him. {nixed voices) Thompson ; He's done a very good job on the Turkish situation, t voices mixed and low) JFKt Let T s just say, it seems to me that on Hare if we don T t want to — we try to get the Russians off the Turkish trade — then we probably don't want to do anything with Hare for twentyfour hours till we get seme sort of an answer* Thompson ; This is Hare's telegram* I don't know if you saw it or not* (mixed voice 6} JFK ; Well, let's see — uh — let's give him an explanation of what we're trying, to do.
We're trying to cat it back on the original preposition of last night w and — because we don't want to get into this trade.
If we're unsuccessful, then we — its possible that we may have to get back on the Jupiter thing* if we <2o, then we would of course want it to come from the Turks themselves and HMO, rather than just the United States, we're hopeful, however, that that won't coma.
This time we would make it perfectly clear that if they attack our aircraft, we're going in after some of their MIGa.

This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the island of Cuba, Within the past week, unmis taxable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island « The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.
Several of them include Medium Range Ballistic Missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1000 nautical miles* Each of these missiles.
In short, is capable of striking Washington, D, C , the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the Southeastern part of the United States, in Central America, or in the Caribbean area.
Additional sites rot yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range ballistic missiles -capable of traveling more than twice as far and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging as far North as Hudson's Bay, Canada, and as far South as Lima, Peru.
In addition, jet bombers , K capable of carrying nuclear weapons, are now being u aerated and assembled in Cuba, while the necessary air bases are being prepared.
This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base -* by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Bio Pact of 1947, the traditions of this Nation and Hemisphere, the Joint Resolution of the B7th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own public warnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13.
Our own strategic missiles have never been transferred to the territory of any other nation, under a cloak of secrecy and deception; and our history, unlike that of the Soviets since the end of florid far II, demonstrates that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any other nation or impose our system upon its people.
Nevertheless, American citizens have become adjusted to living daily on the bull's eye of Soviet missiles located inside the United States SB or in submarines.
MORE Page 3 In that sense s missiles in Cuba add to an already clear and present danger — although it should be noted the nations of Latin America have never previously been subjected to a potential nuclear threat.
Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to pre vent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere, Our policy has been one of patience and restraint, as befits a peaceful and powerful nation, which leads a worldwide alliance.
We have been determined not to be diverted from our central concerns by mere irritants and fanatics* But now further action is required — and it is underway; and these actions may only be the beginning.
This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers, tfe are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1943.
It shall be the policy of this Nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union ♦ 4) Fourth ; As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Guantanarao, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional military units to be on a standby alert basis.
Under the Charter of the United ifations , we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convokedwithout delay to take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace.
This Nation is prepared to present its case against the Soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful wo rid j at any time and in any forum -.in the OAS, in the United Nations, or in any other meeting that could be useful -without limiting our freedom of action.
We have in the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, ffe have proposed the elimination of all arms and military bases in a fair and effective disarmament treaty.
Any hostile move anywhere in the MORE Page 5 world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are committed -Including in particular the brave people of West Berlin -will be met by whatever action is needed.
Finally, 1 want to say a few words to the captive people of Cuba, to whom this speech is being directly carried by special radio facilities* I speak to you as a friend, a& one who knows of your deep attachment to your fatherland, as one who shares your aspirations for liberty and justice for all* And 1 have watched and the American people have watched with deep sorrow how your nationalist revolution was betrayed -and how your fatherland fell. under foreign domination.
They are puppets and agents of an international conspiracy which has turned Cuba against your friends and neighbors in the Americas — and turned it into the first Latin American country to become a target for nuclear war -the first latin American country to have these weapons on its soil, + These new weapons are not in your interest.
But this country has no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you, We know that your lives and land are being used as pawns by those who deny you freedom.
And then shall Cuba be welcomed bade to the society of free nations and to the associations of this Hemisphere.
Let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out.
Many months of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead -months in which both our patience and our will will be tested -months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers* But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing, The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are -but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world* The cost of freedom is always high -but Americans have always paid it.
And one path we shall never choose and that is the path of surrender or submission* Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right -not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this Hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world, God willing, that goal will be achieved.
The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere* Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last Tuesday morning at 9m., 2 I directed that our surveillance be stepped up.
And having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action, this Government feels obliged to report this new crisis to you in full detail.
Several of them Medium Range Ballistic Missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1000 nautical miles.
Each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D,C, f the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the Southeastern part 6f the United States, in Central America or in the Caribbean area.
Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles -capable of travelling more than twice as far — and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, ranging as far north as Hudson's Bay, Canada and as far south as Lima, Peru, In addition, jet bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, are now being uncrated and assembled on Cuba, while the necessary air bases are being prepared.
This urgent transformation off Cuba into an important strategic base by the presence of these large, long-range and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction -constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Rio Pact of 1947, the traditions of | this nation and Hemisphere, the Joint | Resolution of the 87th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own public warnings to the Soviets on September i and fc3.
We no longer live ran a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation f s security to constitute a maximum perilNuclear weapons are so destructive, and ballistic missiles are so swift, that any substantially increased possibility of their use or any sudden change in their deployment may well be regarded as a definite threat to the peace.
Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination frnm the Western Hemisphere.
The Foreign Ministers of the OAS in their communique of October 6 rejected secrecy on such matters in this Hemisphere, Should these offensive military continue, thus increasing fche threat to the Hemisphere, further action will be justified, I have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventualities; and I trust that, in the interest of both the Cuban people and . the Soviet technicians at these sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing this threat will be recogn i zed.
It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear Jnissile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States requiring a full retaliatory response upon the S w let Un ion.
As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our base at Suantanamo, evacuated today the dependants of our personnel there and ordered additional military units to stand by on an alert basis. 5) ttfih: We are calling tonight *or an immediate meeting of the Organ of Consultation under the Organization of America states, 17 to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke Articles 6 and 8 of the Rio Treaty in support of all necessary action.
Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace* IB Our Resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in Cuba, under the supervision of UN observers, before the quarantine can be lifted.
This nation is prepared to present its case against this Soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful world, at any time and in any forutn in the OAS T in the United Nations, or in any other meeting that could be useful -without limiting our freedom of action.
We have proposed the elimination of all arm© and military bases in a fair and effective disarmament treaty.
And I have watched with deep sorrow how your nationalist revolution was betrayed "" and how your fatherland fell under foreign domination.
Now your leaders are no longer Cuban leaders inspired by Cuban ideals, Theyare puppets and agents of an international conspiracy which has turned Cuba against your friends and neighbors in the Americas — and turned it into the first Latin American country to become a target for nuclear war -the first Latin American country to have these weapons on its soil.
But this country has no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you* We know your lives and land are being used as pawns by those who deny you . freedom.
The cost of freedom is always high but Americans have always paid it* And one path we shall never choose is the path of surrender or submission.
Our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right « not peace at the expense of freedom, 26 but both peace and freedom, here this Hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world.
Thi* Govcmrncnti as promised* has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the Island of Cuba, ""Within the past week* unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive nuclear missile sites is now in preparation on that unhappy island.
Until leas than week ago, no reliable information of this nature had been received -but> having now completed its evaluation nod our determination upon a course o£ action* this Co ve rnment feals obliged to report this new crisis to you in full detail* Four and possibly five of these sites > containing 4 launchers each, am Medium Range Ballistic Missile sites* with two missiles to be loaded on each launcher.
Each of those missiles would ba capable of carrying a nucleaT warhead for a distance of more than 1000 nautical miles* Each of these 32 missiles, in short, is capable Of Striking Washington, D,C< , the Panama Canal.
Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the Southeastern part of the United States , in Central America or in the Caribbean area* Two additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for sixteen Intermediate Range Bailie tic Missiles — capable of travelling more than twlca as far and thus capable of Striking almost any city in the Western Hemisphere T ranging as far north as Hudson 1 s Bay* Canada and as far south as Uiraa., Peru.
This ■ action also contradicts the repeated assurances, of Soviet 9poK«smen t both publicly and privately delivered, fliat the arms build-up in Cuba would retain its original defensive character t and that Soviet missiles would ""ncrei be Stationed Ort the territory of any other nation.
Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small, We no longer Hve in a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a aufficient challenge to a nation's sennnty to constitute an ""armed attach"" under Article 51 of the UN Chapter.
Such a blockade can Clearly be authorised both by the requirements, of selfdefease and by the Organ of Consultation of the Organisation of American States t acting under Articles 6 and B of the Rio Treaty and this year's Funta del Este Resolution, All fhips bound for Cuba, from ****** whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of weapons, be turned back.
Such a blockade will be extended, if needed, to other types Of cargo and carriers.
In short, it will not only prevent completion be faced. of the current offensive build-up on Cuba, It will also require the Soviet Union to choose between fighting the U, S, Navy In American waters or abandoning its build-up on Cuba.
I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance o£ Cuba acid its military build-up* The Foreign Ministers of the OAS in their communique of October 6 rejected secrecy on such matter e in this Hemisphere.
We shall urge the Utf and the OAS to demand removal of these offensive weapons f and the prompt dispatch o£ an international inspection team to make certain that this is done.
By his action last week the wo rid has moved a step closer to the brink of that dark and awful abyss of destruction.
It xs lime for both sides to step back from that brink -to refrain from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis -and to resume the search for peaceful and permanent eolations > This nation is prepared to present its case against this tbreat to peace and our own proposal a for a peaceful world at any time, in ajiy forum, to any figure --in the OAS, in the United Nations, and. to Chairman Khrushchev We hive in the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.
We have proposed the elimination of all arms and overseas bases in a fair and effective dio armament treaty, We are prepared to dUcuea new proposals for the removal of tensions on both aides -including the possibilitiaa of a genuinely independent Cuba, free, to determine its own destiny* vrE^s^rnrit^-^r^fiy [m^T^rf thn eetablishiY^nt^fJarj5tgn_mii6i^ V^e harVC no wish to war with the Soviet Union; for wo are peaceful people who desire to Live m peace with all other peoples.
Lntimj flali nr^g^Sr * That ii why this latest Soviet throat -or any cther^threat which is made either independently or in response to our bt^jlgSe — must and will he met with determination.
Ab4 eh.u-i.-swhy, ' Blwal **«^t*W«HdT^ and-the-bloc lfiirlr wili remain.
My words tonight arc being carried diractly to them -and I want to tell them this, Do not permit yourselves to be coma involved in the giim confrontation of nuclear weapons.
Do not become the first batin American country to have the so weapons on your soil.
Do not bo come the first Latin American country to ha a necessary target for massive destruction.
This nation has no quarrel with the Cuban people, only sympathy and hope.
Wo knew you did not consent to the transformation of your island into a target for nuclear war, We knnw your lives and land are being used as pawns by those who deny you freedom.
We have no wish to cause you to Suffer or to impose any system upon you* Onr objective, en the contrary p is to give back to the Cuban people the dream of their own revolution the dream of ""liberty and justice for all"" which Fidel Caetro repudiated when he sold you out to the Soviets.
And 1 have no doubt that the vast majority of Cubans today looke forward to the time when they will once again be free -free to choose their own leaders, free to select their own system, free to own their own land, to speak and write and worship without fear or degradation.
And when foreign domination is ended, and the use of Cuba as a base o£ subversion and aggression has ceasft^, we shall gladly welcome her back to the society of free nations and to the associations of this Hemisphere.
The cost o£ freedom is always high — but Americans have always paid it.
