He begins by explaining his role as military aide, including carrying the nuclear ""football"" and preparing the president's morning military intelligence briefings.
He relates Kennedy's interest in intelligence generally and with communications.
In particular, the president was fascinated with the instant communications systems designed for contacting military commanders, and during the missile crisis used the system to bypass the chain of command relay system and speak directly to commanders.
Clifton also describes Kennedy's evolving views on the military, including his belief that America could not rely just on nuclear superiority, but needed to reestablish conventional forces.
