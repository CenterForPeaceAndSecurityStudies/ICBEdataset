Cuban President Fidel Castro had met with Khrushchev in July 1961, and the two men had agreed to station short-range nuclear missiles on Cuba.
America already had a number of nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey that threatened the USSR, and had supported the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961.
Although the missiles were identified by American reconnaissance on 15 October, the thirteen days of the crisis officially began when President John F Kennedy was informed the following morning.
Threatened by the discovery of the missiles on Cuba, which lay barely 90 miles from the coast of Florida, the USA responded by enforcing a naval blockade around the island in an attempt to stop any more missiles being delivered.
The Soviet Union initially refused to recognize the blockade, but the ships carrying missiles later turned back while Kennedy and Khrushchev continued a series of tense negotiations.
An agreement was eventually struck in which the USSR would publicly remove the missiles from Cuba while the USA would secretly remove its own from Turkey and Italy.
The Soviet Union broadcast its intention to remove the missiles on Radio Moscow on the morning of 28 October, and the first dismantled missiles were shipped out of Cuba on 5 November.
