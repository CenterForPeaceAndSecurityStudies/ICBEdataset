The Americans felt that Castro was a communist due to his belief in social justice in a well planned economy and his reforms which included the nationalization of United States economic interest.
The USA saw every leader which had a strong belief in socialism and the rights of the people, as well as having visionaries of nationalism as a possible Communist; therefore they felt Castro was yet to be another communist leader following the lead of the Soviet Union which was seen to be a huge threat for the Americans.
The Bay of Pigs was a very important evident as it laid bare the true motives of the American government, and emphasised to Castro that an alliance alongside America was no longer a possibility.
