Crises are sometimes not about power, but about whether states flout international norms. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“We didn’t react immediately, of course, and that’s very important.
Take your time to decide a course of action. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“I would like to emphasize…the importance of not taking irrevocable action.
Nuclear superiority did not matter during the crisis; the threat of even some degree of nuclear devastation proved decisive.
At beginning of any crisis, focus on limited, flexible steps. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“On how much is enough, it is interesting to note that the Missile Crisis did not spread to any of the areas we expected it to.
Nuclear weapons are major deterrents in any international crisis. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“That impulse to be very cautious is something that is becoming ingrained today.
But, over the long haul, one in a thousand is too high if you aren’t steadily reducing it as you go.
On the other hand, one in fifty is acceptable at one time if running the risk results in a later risk of one in a hundred, then one in a thousand, and so on.
Sometimes you should pursue crises with an unacceptably high risk of nuclear war if and only if the crisis results in a later, lower risk of nuclear war.
No real victory can come from nuclear war. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“The question of superiority – you had an advantage that was sixteen or seventeen to one, and despite this fact, you could not use it.
In a nuclear crisis, no side has an advantage that it can actually use; the question of superiority becomes irrelevant. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Both sides must be prepared for compromise and negotiation, and they must be prepared to ignore such things as national prestige and superpower status.
The crisis transformed Soviet thinking about the U.S.; prior to it the Soviets were convinced the United States would use nuclear weapons to put an end to communism.
Governments have a duty to prevent nuclear war; the only way to do that is by getting rid of all nuclear weapons.
In an international crisis, try to avoid overreaction that could risk nuclear war.
In a country so full of construction projects, with so many chicken farms and things everywhere, it would have been the easiest thing in the world for us to build those emplacements under the guise of something totally different and they would have never been discovered.
In international crises, realize that sometimes your allies cannot be trustede.
Cuba’s Struggle with the Superpowers after the Missile Crisis, . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- “We talk an awful lot about the American conventional and nuclear superiority and its importance in forcing the outcome.
In a nuclear world, even a small, “ragtag” nuclear deterrent can significantly alter one’s behavior. -------------------------------------------------------------------------We should obviously use our Soviet specialists, but there’s a problem with relying on expertise too heavily, and that is that these people often have a very particular reading of the Soviet Union.
Nothing substitutes for a little direct experience of the Soviets, and I think for that reason there is a strong argument for much wider contacts with them.
Use experts who have direct experience with the other sideg. they have visited and lived in the other country. -------------------------------------------------------------------------As far as world opinion is concerned, it would be a mistake to overemphasize this today.
You don’t garner world opinion in the last week of a crisis; you need to have it going in.
You will need their support going in. -------------------------------------------------------------------------The tendency is for us to compartmentalize the different options.
Multiple approaches conducted together will do much more than just one option by itself.
Having been forced to retreat before American power, in de Gaulle’s view the Soviet Union would be unlikely and unable to risk any such confrontation again for a long time to come.
Therefore, for him the crisis opened up a new period of diplomatic opportunity in Europe, the era of détente and cooperation with the Soviet Union that he had regularly sought and that he saw as the only alternative to confrontation.
Moreover, for de Gaulle the crisis demonstrated the extreme risk that Europe’s fate could be abruptly determined by a superpower conflict that had nothing whatever to do with Europe itself.
He had been loyal to the United States, but when it was all over, the lesson he drew was that Europe must never be put at risk in such a manner again.
Crisis encouraged France to develop foreign policy more independently and rely more on its own nuclear deterrent than on American security guaranty.
Americans have never had to live with security threats at their borders, like Europeans have.
The implication is that Khrushchev did not consider this, which is why he was surprised by the sharpness of the American reaction to the missiles in Cuba.
They had differing perceptions of the risk involved in the use of force in the nuclear age.
I didn’t believe there would be any Soviet military reaction to an airstrike even if accompanied by an invasion of Cuba, because of their awareness of our military superiority.
That may well be right, but we didn’t worry about that, because we didn’t think the Russians would start anything anyway.
Be wary of a gradual approach when using military force: use “all you’ve got” or do not use it at all.
Kennedy was proclaimed the big winner in the crisis because no one knew about the secret deal.
Khrushchev had been humiliated into withdrawing our missiles from Cuba with no obvious gain.
In fact, the terms of the final settlement were neither a great defeat nor a great victory for Kennedy or Khrushchev.
Kennedy looked like the big winner in the crisis because Khrushchev did not demand a public missile swap, even though he got what he asked for: an American pledge not to invade Cuba and removal of American missiles from Turkey. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“The Soviet leadership could not forget a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation when it was forced to admit its weakness before the whole world and withdraw its missiles from Cuba.
Many Soviets were humiliated by the way the crisis ended, which led the Soviet military establishment to begin a new large-scale nuclear weapons program to achieve strategic balance with American forces. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“I cannot overemphasize the vast significance of the Cuban crisis for the subsequent development of Soviet-American relations.
Those days revealed the mortal danger of direct armed confrontation of the two great powers, a confrontation headed off on the brink of war thanks to both sides’ timely and agonizing realization of the disastrous consequences.
It was this insight that made the political settlement possible, and a substantial role was played by a direct confidential channel between the leaders of the two countries.
Even now that so many years have passed, the political and diplomatic solution at which the two states jointly arrived may be regarded as a model of successfully controlling a crisis.
The crisis had a dramatic influence on subsequent Soviet-American relations.
The threat of mortal danger faced by the great powers opened a path to a political settlement through confidential channels that controlled the crisis and showed that a third world war can be avoided. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Those days revealed the mortal danger of a direct armed confrontation of the two great powers, a confrontation headed off on the brink of war thanks to both sides’ timely and agonizing realization of the disastrous consequences.
If both sides recognize a war’s disastrous consequences, they can avoid war. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Both sides also were left keenly conscious of the need to ease tension.
Easing tension between two adversaries with good faith agreements is crucial to avoid war. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“The importance of the confidential channel was proven as well.
I cannot tell how the Cuban crisis would have ended if these contacts had not been there, and if it had ended badly, the consequences could have been truly disastrous.
The whole experience also provided guidelines for my future diplomatic activity, which I followed for the remainder of my quarter-century as an ambassador.
I tried to be an active participant in the constantly functioning confidential channel at the highest level, in order to ensure possibilities for a candid if not always present dialogue between the leaders of both countries.
Keeping a confidential channel of communication open between two powers plays a huge role in ensuring conflicts do not escalate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“I find this incident has a moral for more exalted politicians: you will never agree on anything if you are already tuned in to a specific notion and cannot or will not hear the other side.
Moscow’s Ambassador to America’s Six Cold War Presdients . -------------------------------------------------------------------------“I agree with Bob McNamara’s main conclusion that it’s more important to avoid crises than to plan to deal with them.
Avoid crises and try to understand adversary’s thinking. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“We have overstated the cautionary effect of nuclear weapons, I think, because the historical records shows that when we warn them against doing something, sometimes they back off and sometimes they do not.
Crises requires people with solid knowledge of situation and adversary, regardless of “rank or position.” -------------------------------------------------------------------------“ was distressed that the representatives with whom he met…seemed to give so little consideration to the implications of steps they suggested.
May they not be that, under the cover of terrible nuclear war, which nobody dares start, you can get away with anything you can do by conventional means.
Nuclear deterrence between two nations allows for both nations to conduct conventional war against one another without fear of nuclear escalation.
Nuclear weapons will destroy nations. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Rationality will not save us.
The Fog of War, directed by Errol Morris , DVD. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- “The indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons carries a very high risk of nuclear catastrophe.
Only way to avoid nuclear catastrophe is to eventually eliminate nuclear weapons.
In crises, consider all the consequences of your actions, especially long-term. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“On your claim that “a little deterrence goes a long way”that was certainly true as far as our group was concerned, but I don’t know that it’s necessarily true for all groups.
Second, keep open your channels of communication with the other side, and keep the dialogue going.
Have people experienced in national security running United States national security policy.
Have experts of the other side readily available. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Each administration, early in its term, should get all the relevant people together to draw preliminary guidelines for the use and non-use of nuclear weapons, first, in retaliation to one’s opponents’ use of nuclear weapons, and second, in all other cases.
In any international crisis, avoid escalating risk of total nuclear war.
Even a small risk is too much. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“The nuclear weapons we have, and the Soviets have, are useless militarily.
Beware of people in power who are either ignorant or closed to new knowledge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Mistakes happen.
They can happen very easily in crisis situations and can change things dramatically. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Crisis management is a very uncertain and very difficult thing to do, and therefore, you’ve just got to avoid the crises in the first place.
Plan ahead for crises. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Provide the president with knowledgeable associates.
Put yourself in your opponent’s shoes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Don’t force the adversary into a cornerdon’t force him into taking some kind of desperate action.
Leave the other side in a crisis room to maneuver and retreat, if necessary.
The idea of a prolonged nuclear war from which one side can emerge with some sort of advantage is nonsense.
One has to have an alternative government in place made up of people who had nothing to do with the events which unfold.
In the first place, people in the government are not going to abandon all their colleagues and their families to get in a helicopter and go charging out to West Virginia.
Emergency plans to evacuate top officials and reconstitute the government with people involved in the crisis are unrealistic.
Essay does not mention that the authors all opposed trade of Jupiter missiles in Turkey for Cuban missiles.
Fear can drive both sides to moral action in the nuclear age. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“We have to establish more general levels of contacts.
Secrecy and surprise are necessary during crisis negotiations. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Our great superiority in nuclear weapons contributed little to the outcome of the Cuba crisis.
Superpowers were not willing to go as far as nuclear war. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Having underestimated in the course of their Vienna meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev felt such confidence in his risky plan as to make no provision for any escape hatch in case that things went badly.
Plan ahead for the possibility of failure. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Even more disastrous was Khrushchev’s error in picking a fight far from home in his adversary’s front yard.
Zbigniew BrzezinskiHillary ClintonRichard HolbrookeHenry KissingerAndrei KokoshinColin PowellCondoleezza RiceArthur SchlesingerBrent ScowcroftTibor TóthViktor Yesin “orty years ago almost to the day an important Presidential emissary was sent abroad by a beleaguered President of the United States.
One of them was…Dean Acheson whose mission was to brief President de Gaulle and to solicit French support in what could be a nuclear war involving not just the United States and the Soviet Union but the entire NATO Alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
The former Secretary of State briefed the French President and then said to him at the end of the briefing, I would now like to show you the evidence, the photographs that we have of Soviet missiles armed with nuclear weapons.
The French President responded by saying, I do not wish to see the photographs.
Do not shut out allies from evidence or intelligence during crisis management.
The United States did not exploit the success either to press the Soviet Union to withdraw from the Caribbean through an arrangement for the full neutralization of Cuba or to structure a more stable and more cooperative relationship with the Soviet Union in the area of strategic arms competition.
Instead, we deluded ourselves with the comfortable belief—expressed explicitly in official statements in the mid-1960s—that the Soviet Union had accommodated itself indefinitely to strategic inferiority.
Take advantage of successful resolution of a crisis to push forward on national goals.
His Finest Hour Now,” World Politics, 27:2 . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- “We no longer live in an age in which the president`s word is trusted internationally the way Kennedy`s was during the Cuban missile crisis.
Missile crisis may have represented height of American political influence abroad; since then, United States appeal abroad has declined.
The 1960s saw a surge in national anxiety over the ‘missile gap’ , demonstrated by growing fears that nuclear deterrence was inherently unstable, by a preoccupation among strategists over the possibility of a disarming Soviet nuclear strike as well as over the growing risks of an accidental nuclear discharge, and eventually even by an effort to develop new forms of technologically advanced space-based defensive systems such as anti-ballistic missiles.
United States no longer invincible from the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
It must instead pursue mutual nuclear restraint in order to ensure stable nuclear order.
It was pushing hard to get the world community to understand, going to the UN, making a presentation, getting international opinion against the placement of Russian weapons in Cuba, making a deal eventually with the Russians that led to the removal of the weapons.
Define your goals clearly to your adversary and your allies during a crisis.
Had the democracies not become so consumed by their internal disputes, they might have interpreted the Berlin crisis for what it was-a demonstration of latent Soviet weakness.
Henry Kissinger, Diplomacy . -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Our reaction to the building of the Berlin Wall may have indicated a propensity to accept just about any fait accompli.
In Cuba, however, the Soviets chose to challenge us in the most direct and brutal fashion.
The dilemma of any statesman is that he can never be certain about the probable course of events…. is above all a question of the criteria of certainty by which a government operates.
Dilemma of crises is that you must sometimes act in face of uncertainty without “hard,” or definite, intelligence.
Include individuals with different perspectives in decision-making process during crisis.
Cited in Yevgeny Podzorov, “What does the Caribbean Crisis Teach Us,” Red Star, May 18, 2012. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“The 1962 Cuban missile crisis is highly instructive in regards to the demands made on the system of strategic command and control at all levels, whether a supreme commander, a pilot of a reconnaissance plane, or a ship’s commander.
Necessity for firm leadership during crisis, with minimum delegation to lower-level officials; Develop crisis management mechanism before a crisis occurs; Need politically and psychologically stable leaders; Must have control over the military; Know your adversary’s decision making process.
We were glued to the set every evening during the thirteen-day standoff.
We’d never bothered with a bomb shelter in the house, even at the height of the Cold War.
But some of our friends did have them, fully stocked with provisions to survive a nuclear exchange.
Because the missiles were deployed just ninety miles from the Florida coast, the newscasters reported, probably incorrectly, that Birmingham was in range.
I could tell that my father was worried, and I realized this was something my parents couldn’t save me from.
Daddy explained our country had never last a war, and he was sure we weren’t going to lose this one.
He was nevertheless visibly relieved when the Soviet ships turned around, ending the crisis.
I once told an audience of Cuban Americans that Fidel Castro had put the United States at risk in allowing those missiles to be deployed.
The United States can be made vulnerable by rash actions of hostile actors.
For all the attention given Cuba, however, what happened in Berlin was even more decisive in shaping the era between the end of World War II in 1945 and German unification and Soviet dissolution in 1990 and 1991.
It was unknown to him that Soviet commanders were delegated the authority to use these missiles on their own judgment.
Also unknown to him was that the three commanding officers on one Soviet submarine were split two-to-one over whether to launch a nuclear-tipped torpedo against the United States.
Kennedy’s statesmanship worked because a few lucky events prevented an accidental start to World War III. -------------------------------------------------------------------------""As the world teetered on the brink of nuclear catastrophe, the two nations agreed to add a softer, more cooperative option to the toolbox.
Other means of engagement, such as geopolitical brinksmanship, only exacerbate tensions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------""Fifty years and 1,500 tests later, with three times more nuclear warheads and three times more nuclear-armed states, the world is still waiting to close the door on nuclear testing through the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
We must utilize all of the cooperative tools at our disposal to avoid conflict and achieve nuclear disarmament.
In order to avoid further nuclear confrontations, we must engage in nuclear diplomacy.
For the first time the United States found itself in a position of 'equal danger' with USSR in what made the American ruling elite conclude that their country's enormous nuclear potential, that guaranteed defeat of any hostile country, cannot protect United States citizens.
American experts predicted that 80 million Americans would die in a United States nuclear exchange with Russia.
Having assessed such damage as unacceptable, the United States leadership had to make a compromise in resolution of the crisis.
A parity of fear took shape, in which neither the United States nor the Soviet Union could consider themselves entitled to a victory in nuclear war.
And that became one of the main tenets on which the strategy of nuclear deterrence is based.
Mutual nuclear deterrence – that took shape during the Cuban missile crisis – turned out to be a very stable concept that transcended even the Cold War itself.
