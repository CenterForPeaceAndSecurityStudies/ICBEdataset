This crisis is also known as the Caribbean Crisis and the Missile scare, took place in October 1962 and was broadcasted on television all over the world.
Discovery of Missiles After the United States tried to overthrow Fidel Castro’s rule in Cuba and failed in the Bay of Pigs invasion, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made a secret deal with Castro to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to foil any other American attempts to invade.
During routine surveillance flights, United States intelligence however discovered the construction sites of these missiles and president Kennedy went public with the news.
Instead of attacking Cuba, the Kennedy-rule decided to rather place their navy and air force in such a way to “quarantine” the missile sites.
The United States also promised to withdraw its missiles from Turkey in a 6 months period.
This marked a very important moment in the Cold War, as for the first time, both leaders really tried to understand one another’s intentions and direct communication was set up through a telephone line directly to the White House.
