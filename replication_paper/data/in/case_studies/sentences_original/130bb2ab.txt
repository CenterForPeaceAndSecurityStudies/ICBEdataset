Increasing drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Sinaloa, Mexico, 1997-2005.
In 2006, we showed that resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs remained frequent in Sinaloa.
The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis trends and to investigate the probability that patients acquire resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs on recurrence after treatment in Sinaloa.
Sputum specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with TB at all the health care institutions of Sinaloa during 1997-2005.
Of 50 patients registered twice between 1997 and 2005, 15 were fully susceptible at first registration, of whom six acquired drug resistance.
Of 35 cases with any drug resistance at first registration, 21 came to acquire resistance to at least one other drug.
The proportion of drug-resistant TB increased during 1997-2005 in Sinaloa.
A two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded water layer in the structure of a cobalt cubane complex.
PubMed Qi, Ji; Zhai, Xiang-Sheng; Zhu, Hong-Lin; Lin, Jian-Li 2014-02-01 A tetranuclear Co oxide complex with cubane topology, tetrakisN,N')di-μ2-carbonato-κO:O'-tetra-μ3-oxido-tetracobalt pentadecahydrate, ·15H2O, with an unbounded hydrogen-bonded water layer, has been synthesized by reaction of CoCO3 and 2,2'-bipyridine.
The solvent water molecules form a hydrogen-bonded net with tetrameric and pentameric water clusters as subunits.
The Co4O4 cubane-like cores are sandwiched between the water layers, which are further stacked into a three-dimensional metallo-supramolecular network.
We predicted that Hexageniawould also disperse eastward or expand from existing localized populations and colonize large regions of the other basins.
We sampled zoobenthos in parts of the western and central basins yearly from 1997–2005, along the north shore of the eastern basin in 2001–2002, and throughout the lake in 2004.
In the island area of the western basin, Hexagenia was present at densities ≤1,278 nymphs/m2and exhibited higher densities in odd years than even years.
By contrast, Hexagenia became more widespread in the central basin from 1997–2000 at densities ≤48 nymphs/m2 but was mostly absent from 2001–2005.
Nymphs were found along an eastern basin transect at densities ≤382/m2 in 2001 and 2002.
Hexagenia was found at 2 of 62 stations in harbors, marinas, and tributaries along the south shore of the central basin in 2005.
Oxygen depletion at the sediment-water interface and cool temperatures in the hypolimnion are probably the primary factors preventing successful establishment throughout much of the central basin.
Hexagenia can be a useful indicator of lake quality where its distribution and abundance are limited by anthropogenic causes.
Diabetes-related mortality among Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans in the United States.
PubMed Smith, Chrystal A S; Barnett, Elizabeth 2005-12-01 Hispanics are the most rapidly growing minority group in the United States, and Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans are the three largest Hispanic subgroups.
This paper examines diabetes-related mortality in Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans over 35 years of age in the United States during 1996 and 1997.
Using data from the National Vital Statistics System and the 1990 and 2000 censuses, we calculated age-adjusted and age-specific diabetes-related death rates for Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans over 35 years of age.
Diabetes-related deaths were determined to be any death for which diabetes was coded as either the underlying or contributing cause of death.
After diabetes, heart disease followed by cancer and stroke were the most frequent primary underlying causes of diabetes-related deaths in all three ethnic groups.
Our analyses of these data demonstrate that diabetes-related mortality differed among Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cuban Americans more than 35 years of age in the United States in 1996 and 1997.
Socioeconomic factors such as low educational attainment and low income may be factors that contributed to the disparities in these mortality rates for different subgroups.
Further research is needed to update these findings and to investigate explanatory risk factors.
Diversity among Hispanic subgroups has persisted in recent years and should be considered when health policies and services targeted at these populations are developed.
The original model was calibrated using water-level observations from 1972, 1982, 1992, and 1998, and water-use data through 1997.
The original model subsequently was used to simulate water levels from 1999 to 2049 and showed that simulation of continued pumping at the 1997 water-use rate could not be sustained indefinitely without causing dry cells in the model.
Additionally, water-use data were compiled and used for the same period, totaling 290,005 discrete water-use values from 43,440 wells with as many as 39,169 wells pumping in any one year.
Total pumping for this 8-year period was about 2. trillion cubic feet of water and was distributed over approximately 10,340 square miles within the model area.
An updated version of the original ground-water flow model was used to simulate the period of 1998-2005 with the additional water-level and water-use data.
The maximum water-level residual for the 3,616 water-level observations was 52 feet, the minimum water-level residual was 60 feet, the average annual root mean squared error was 8. feet, and the annual average absolute residual was 6. feet.
Lifestyle risk factors for coronary heart disease in Cubans have not been compared to risk factors in Cuban Americans.
The data on Cuban Americans are largely based on the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , 1982–1984, while more recent data on epidemiological trends in Cuba are available.
The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus remains greater in Cuban Americans than in Cubans.
However, dietary preferences, low physical activity, and tobacco use are contributing to the rising rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and CHD in Cuba, putting Cubans at increased cardiovascular risk.
Comprehensive national strategies for cardiovascular prevention that address these modifiable lifestyle risk factors are necessary to address the increasing threat to public health in Cuba.
An Insider’s View NASA Astrophysics Data System Altshuler, Ernesto In a previous paper, the author reached some conclusions on the tendencies of the publications by Cuban physicists in international journals :173-182, 2005) and called for a systematic bibliometric study of the subject.
Such a study has now been undertaken and supports the main conclusions of the former work.
As a positive result, the total volume of Cuban publications in international physics journals has increased since 1995, perhaps reaching a peak around the year 2000, while the number of citations of Cuban papers and the impact of the journals in which they were published have continued to increase since the mid-1990s.
Theoretical work produced by physicists from a number of Cuban institutions in international collaborations strongly contribute to those numbers.
In the last years, international publications suggest a `self-organized' opening of Cuban physics towards interdisciplinary subjects, which is increasing the `bibliometric visibility' of autochthonous experimental work.
This is the first issue of the Cuban Studies Newsletter, a biannual publication designed to provide comprehensive and timely communication among those interested in Cuban Studies.

Data for 1997 included in this report are from continuous water-level records from 71 wells and chloride analyses from 14 wells.
In 1997, annual mean ground-water levels in Georgia ranged from 6. feet lower to 5. ft higher than in 1996.
Of the 71 wells summarized in this report, 23 wells had annual mean water levels that were higher, 35 wells had annual mean water levels that were lower, and 11 wells had annual mean water levels that were about the same in 1997 as during 1996.
Data for two wells are incomplete because data collection was discontinued at one well, and the equipment was vandalized at one well.
These record lows were from 0. to 5. ft lower than previous record lows.
Chloride concentration in water from the Upper Floridan aquifer in most of coastal Georgia was within drinking-water standards established by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
In the Savannah area, chloride concentration has not changed appreciably with time.
However, chloride concentration in water from some wells that tap the Floridan aquifer system in the Brunswick area exceeds the drinking-water standard.
Ground-water-level and ground-water-quality data are essential for water assessment and management.
Ground-water-level fluctuations and trends can be used to estimate changes in aquifer storage resulting from the effects of ground-water withdrawal and recharge from precipitation.
These data can be used to address water-management needs and to evaluate the effects of management and conservation programs.

In addition to issuing new operating criteria, the ROD mandated experimental releases for the purpose of conducting scientific studies.
This paper examines the financial implications of the experimental flows that were conducted at the GCD from 1997 to 2005.more » An experimental release may have either a positive or negative impact on the financial value of energy production.
This study estimates the financial costs of experimental releases, identifies the main factors that contribute to these costs, and compares the interdependencies among these factors.
An integrated set of tools was used to compute the financial impacts of the experimental releases by simulating the operation of the GCD under two scenarios, namely, a baseline scenario that assumes operations comply with the ROD operating criteria and experimental releases that actually took place during the study period, and a ''without experiments'' scenario that is identical to the baseline scenario of operations that comply with the GCD ROD, except it assumes that experimental releases did not occur.
Extensive data sets and historical information on SLCA/IP power plant characteristics, hydrologic conditions, and Western Area Power Administration's power purchase prices were used for the simulation.

The United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, summarized the 1950-2005 water-use information for Oklahoma.
This report presents 1950-2005 estimates of freshwater withdrawal for water use in Oklahoma by source and category in 5-year intervals.
Withdrawal data were aggregated and tabulated by county, major river basin, and principal aquifer.
This program serves many purposes such as quantifying how much, where, and for what purpose water is used; tracking and documenting water-use trends and changes; and providing these data to other agencies to support hydrologic projects.
In 2005, data at both the county and subbasin levels were compiled into the USGS national water-use database system; these data are published in a statewide summary report and a national circular.
Estimates of water use in Wisconsin indicate that about 8,608 million gallons per day were withdrawn during 2005.
Surface water used for cooling at thermoelectric-power plants constituted the largest portion of daily use at 6,898 Mgal/d.
Public supply served approximately 71 percent of the estimated 2005 Wisconsin population of 5.54 million people; two counties Milwaukee and Dane accounted for more than one-third of the public-supply withdrawal.
The largest use of water in South Dakota during 2005 was irrigation, which accounted for about 58 percent of the total water withdrawn, followed by public supply, which accounted for about 20 percent of withdrawals.
Public-supply systems served about 666,210 people, or about 86 percent of South Dakota's population in 2005.
About 65 percent of the public-supply water was used for domestic purposes, and the average per capita domestic use was 99 gal/d.
Self-supplied domestic withdrawals were about 8 Mgal/d, all of which was from ground water.
About 109,750 people obtained household water from private wells in 2005, and per capita use was about 70 gal/d.
Industrial self-supplied water use during 2005 was about 4 Mgal/d, of which about 98 percent was from ground water and about 2 percent was from surface water.
Total withdrawals for thermoelectric use were about 5 Mgal/d, of which about 1 Mgal/d was from ground water and about 4 Mgal/d was from surface water.

The N aquifer is the major source of water in the 5,400-square-mile Black Mesa area, and the ground water occurs under confined and unconfined conditions.
Monitoring activities include continuous and periodic measurements of ground-water pumpage from the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer, ground-water levels in the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer, surface-water discharge, and chemistry of the ground water and surface water.
In 1997, ground-water withdrawals for industrial and municipal use totaled about 7,090 acre-feet, which is less than a 1-percent increase from 1996.
Pumpage from the confined part of the aquifer increased by about 2 percent to 5,510 acre-feet, and pumpage from the unconfined part of the aquifer decreased by about 4 percent to 1,580 acre-feet.
Water-level declines in the confined part during 1997 were recorded in 5 of 12 wells; however, the median change was a rise of about 0. foot as opposed to a decline of 2. feet for 1996.
Water-level declines in the unconfined part were recorded in 7 of 15 wells, and the median change was 0. foot in 1997 as opposed to a decline of 0. foot in 1996.
The low-flow discharge at the Moenkopi streamflow-gaging station ranged from 1. to 2. cubic feet per second in 1997.
Streamflow-discharge measurements also were made at Laguna Creek, Dinnebito Wash, and Polacca Wash during 1997.
The low-flow discharge ranged from 2. to 4. cubic feet per second at Laguna Creek, 0.44 to 0.48 cubic foot per second at Dinnebito Wash, and 0.15 to 0.26 cubic foot per second at Polacca Wash.
Discharge from Moenkopi School Spring increased by about 3 gallons per minute from the measurement in 1996.
Surface-water sources provided 64 percent of the State's water supplies.
Groundwater produced from wells and springs in Middle and East Tennessee and from wells in West Tennessee provided 36 percent of the public water supplies.
Tennessee public water-supply systems withdraw less groundwater than surface water, and surface-water use has increased at a faster rate than groundwater use.
However, 34 systems reported increased groundwater withdrawals during 2000–2005, and 15 of these 34 systems reported increases of 1 Mgal/d or more.
The county with the largest surface-water withdrawal rate was Davidson County.
Each of Tennessee's 95 counties was served by at least one public water-supply system in 2005.
The largest groundwater withdrawal rate by a single public water-supply system was reported by Memphis Light, Gas and Water, which served 654,267 people in Shelby County in 2005.
Although renewable, these water resources are finite, and continued growth in population, tourism, and agriculture will place increased demands on these water supplies.
Freshwater is vital for sustaining Florida's population, economy, and agricultural production.
Accurate estimates reflecting water use and trends in Florida are compiled in 5-year intervals by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Northwest Florida, St.
This coordinated effort provides the necessary data and information for planning future water needs and resource management.
The purpose of this fact sheet is to present the highlights of water use in Florida for 2005 along with some significant trends in withdrawals since 1950.
It is a vital component of human existence and essential to the overall quality of life.
Wise stewardship of this valuable resource depends on a continuing assessment of water availability and water use.
Population growth in many parts of the State has resulted in increased competition for available water resources.
This competition includes offstream uses, such as residential, agricultural, and industrial, and instream uses for maintenance of species habitat and diversity, navigation, power generation, recreation, and water quality.
Accurate water-use information is required for sound management decisions within this competitive framework and is necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the link between water use, water supply, and overall water availability.
A study of water use during 2005 was conducted by the United States Geological Survey , in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, Office of Water Resources, Water Management Branch , to provide water-use data for local and State water managers.

Their remarkable chemical and solid-state properties have induced great scientific interest.
Both materials form polymorphic crystals of molecules with variable orientational ordering.
The idea of intercalating fullerene with cubane was raised several years ago but no attempts at preparation have been reported.
Here we show that C60 and similarly C70 form high-symmetry molecular crystals with cubane owing to topological molecular recognition between the convex surface of fullerenes and the concave cubane.
Static cubane occupies the octahedral voids of the face-centred-cubic structures and acts as a bearing between the rotating fullerene molecules.
The smooth contact of the rotor and stator molecules decreases significantly the temperature of orientational ordering.
The size-dependent molecular recognition promises selective formation of related structures with higher fullerenes and/or substituted cubanes.
Because our observing program during the 1996-1997 Mars apparition did not include concomitant measurement of nearby CO 2 bands, high northern latitude data were corrected for dust and aerosol extinction assuming an optical depth of 0.8, consistent with ground-based and HST imaging of northern dust storms.
All other measurements with airmass greater than 3. were corrected using a total optical depth of 0.5.
Total consumptive water use also was estimated for each county in Georgia for 2005.
Offstream use is defined as water withdrawn or diverted from a groundor surface-water source and transported to the place of use.
Estimates for offstream water use include the categories of public supply, domestic, commercial, industrial, mining, irrigation, livestock, aquaculture, and thermoelectric power.
Instream use is that which occurs within a stream channel for such purposes as hydroelectric-power generation, navigation, water-quality improvement, fish propagation, and recreation.
The only category of instream use estimated was hydroelectric-power generation.
Georgia law requires any water user who withdraws more than 100,000 gallons per day on a monthly average to obtain a withdrawal permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.
The Georgia Water-Use Program collects the reported information under the withdrawal permit system and the drinking-water permit system and stores the data in the Georgia Water-Use Data System.
These wells include 19 in the surficial aquifer system, 20 in the Brunswick aquifer system and equivalent sediments, 69 in the Upper Floridan aquifer, 17 in the Lower Floridan aquifer and underlying units, 10 in the Claiborne aquifer, 1 in the Gordon aquifer, 10 in the Clayton aquifer, 12 in the Cretaceous aquifer system, 2 in Paleozoic-rock aquifers, and 11 in crystalline-rock aquifers.
An exception to this pattern of water-level recovery is in the Cretaceous aquifer system where water levels in 7 of the 12 wells monitored were below normal during 2005.
In addition to continuous water-level data, periodic synoptic water-level measurements were collected and used to construct potentiometric-surface maps for the Upper Floridan aquifer in the Camden County-Charlton County area during September 2004 and May 2005, in the Brunswick area during June 2004 and June 2005, and in the City of Albany-Dougherty County area during October 2004 and during October 2005.
In general, the configuration of the potentiometric surfaces showed little change during 2004-2005 in each of the areas.
Each station is hyperlinked to a station summary showing seasonal and annual stream characteristics for the current year and for the period of record.
For continuous discharge stations, the station summary includes a one page graphical summary page containing five graphs, a station map, and a photograph of the station.

Availability of water is an important issue in northeastern Arizona because of continued water requirements for industrial and municipal use and the needs of a growing population.
Precipitation in the Black Mesa area averages about 6 to 14 inches per year.
The water monitoring program in the Black Mesa area began in 1971 and is designed to provide information about the long-term effects of ground-water withdrawals from the N aquifer for industrial and municipal uses.
This report presents results of data collected for the monitoring program in the Black Mesa area from January 2005 to September 2006.
The monitoring program includes measurements of ground-water pumping, ground-water levels, spring discharge, surface-water discharge, ground-water chemistry, and periodic testing of ground-water withdrawal meters.
In 2005, ground-water withdrawals in the Black Mesa area totaled 7,330 acre-feet, including ground-water withdrawals for industrial and municipal uses.
From 2004 to 2005, total withdrawals increased by less than 2 percent, industrial withdrawals increased by approximately 3 percent, and total municipal withdrawals increased by 0.35 percent.
From 2005 to 2006, annually measured water levels in the Black Mesa area declined in 10 of 13 wells in the unconfined areas of the N aquifer, and the median change was -0. foot.
Measurements indicated that water levels declined in 12 of 15 wells in the confined area of the aquifer, and the median change was -1. feet.
From the prestress period to 2006, the median water-level change for 29 wells was -8. feet.
Median water-level changes were -0. foot for 13 wells in the unconfined areas and -46. feet for 16 wells in the confined area.
In 2005, an estimated 38 percent was consumed and 62 percent was returned to the hydrologic system.

Water-withdrawal data for 1995 and 2000 were previously published in Solley and others and Hutson and others , respectively.
This report is a graphical representation of permitted withdrawals for 1995, 2000, and 2005.
Small increases and decreases in permitted public water-supply withdrawals can be attributed to population changes.
Large increases and decreases can be attributed to merging of supply systems, change in source, or purchases from other counties.
Most introduced species are restricted to the urban and suburban areas along the coasts, but some species, like the Cuban Treefrog , are locally abundant in natural protected areas.
Although Cuban Treefrogs are known predators of native treefrog species as both adults and larvae, no study has demonstrated a negative effect of Cuban Treefrogs on native treefrog survival, abundance, or occupancy rate.
We monitored survival, capture probability, abundance, and proportion of sites occupied by Cuban Treefrogs and two native species, Green Treefrogs and Squirrel Treefrogs , at four sites in Everglades National Park in southern Florida with the use of capture–mark–recapture techniques.
After at least 5 mo of monitoring all species at each site we began removing every Cuban Treefrog captured.
We continued to estimate survival, abundance, and occupancy rates of native treefrogs for 1 yr after the commencement of Cuban Treefrog removal.
Mark–recapture models that included the effect of Cuban Treefrog removal on native treefrog survival did not have considerable Akaike's Information Criterion weight, although capture rates of native species were generally very low prior to Cuban Treefrog removal.
Estimated abundance of native treefrogs did increase after commencement of Cuban Treefrog removal, but also varied with the season of the year.
The best models of native treefrog occupancy included a Cuban Treefrog removal effect at sites with high initial densities of Cuban Treefrogs.
This study demonstrates that an introduced predator can have population-level effects on similar native species.

Several reasons contribute to their success, including a generalist diet, high fecundity and the ability to reproduce year-round, and use of disturbed or human-modified habitats.
Scientists and managers are concerned that Cuban Treefrogs may contribute to the decline of native treefrogs.
Cuban Treefrogs may exclude native treefrogs through both competition and predation.
Because the evidence from our study and others suggests that Green and Squirrel Treefrogs do not alter their behavior to avoid Cuban Treefrogs, there is cause for concern that sampling with PVC pipes may increase the vulnerability of the native species to predation.
This possibility needs further research, including whether other species of native treefrogs sympatric to where Cuban Treefrogs have invaded are also naïve to the possible threat posed by these frogs, and also if native treefrogs eventually learn to avoid Cuban Treefrogs.
The net value of health care for patients with type 2 diabetes, 1997 to 2005.

To assess the net value of health care for patients with type 2 diabetes.
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, a not-for-profit integrated health care delivery system. patients with type 2 diabetes.
Changes in inflation-adjusted annual health care spending and in health status between 1997 and 2005 , holding age and diabetes duration constant across the observation period , and simulated outcomes for all diabetes complications based on the UKPDS Outcomes Model.
Net value was estimated as the present discounted monetary value of improved survival and avoided treatment spending for coronary heart disease minus the increase in annual spending per patient.
Assuming that 1 life-year is worth $200,000 and accounting for changes in modifiable cardiovascular risk, the net value of changes in health care for patients with type 2 diabetes was $10,911 per patient between 1997 and 2005, a positive dollar value that suggests the value of health care has improved despite increased spending.
The patient population was homogeneous and small, and the wide CIs of the estimates are compatible with a decrease as well as an increase in value.
The economic value of improvements in health status for patients with type 2 diabetes seems to exceed or equal increases in health care spending, suggesting that those increases were worth the extra cost.
However, the possibility that society is getting less value for its money could not be statistically excluded, and there is opportunity to improve the value of diabetes-related health care.
An analysis of the growth based on the size and age distributions of the hawksbill sea turtle inhabiting Cuban waters.
The SCL ranged from 51. to 96. cm with 68. cm of mean and 68. cm of median.
Ages of captured turtles estimated from the C 1 surface patterns were ranged from 3. to 61. years old with 15. years of mean and 14. years of median.
The maturation age and the rate of sexually matured Cuban hawksbill turtles were also discussed based on these results.
Since 1950, the United States Geological Survey has, at 5-year intervals, compiled data on the amount of water used in homes, businesses, industries, and on farms throughout the State.
This water-use data, combined with other related USGS information, has facilitated a unique understanding of the effects of human activity on the State's water resources.
As water availability continues to emerge as an important issue in the 21st century, the need for consistent, long-term water-use data will increase to support wise use of this essential natural resource.
This report presents state and county estimates of the amount of publicand self-supplied water used for domestic, irrigation, livestock, aquaculture, industrial, mining, and thermoelectric power purposes in the State of Washington during 2005.
Irrigation water use was estimated to be 3,520 Mgal/d, or 61 percent of the total.
These three categories accounted for about 81 percent of the total of the estimated offstream freshwater use in Washington during 2005.
This report includes records on both surface and ground water in the State.
Also included are lists of active and discontinued continuous-record surface-water-quality stations, and partial-record and miscellaneous surfacewater-quality stations.
These data represent that part of the National Water Data System operated by the United States Geological Survey and cooperating Federal, State, and local agencies in Alabama.
Streamflow in the model was calibrated and tested with available data from five United States Geological Survey streamflow-gaging stations for 1997-2004.
Simulated streamflow volumes closely matched measured streamflow volumes at all streamflow-gaging stations.
Total simulated streamflow volumes were within 10 percent of measured values.
Two months that included major floods accounted for about 50 percent of all the streamflow measured at the most downstream gaging station during 1997-2004.
Water-quality properties and constituents in the model were calibrated using available data from 13 sites in and near the Leon Creek watershed for varying periods of record during 1992-2005.
Average simulated daily mean water temperature and dissolved oxygen at the most downstream gaging station during 1997-2000 were within 1 percent of average measured daily mean water temperature and dissolved oxygen.
Simulated concentrations of dissolved ammonia nitrogen and dissolved nitrate nitrogen closely matched measured concentrations after calibration.

PubMed Nayeri, K 1995-08-01 This paper explores the dynamics of health and health care in Cuba during a period of severe crisis by placing it within its economic, social, and political context using a comparative historical approach.
It outlines Cuban achievements in health care as a consequence of the socialist transformations since 1959, noting the full commitment by the Cuban state, the planned economy, mass participation, and a self-critical, working class perspective as crucial factors.
The roles of two external factors, the United States economic embargo and the Council of Mutual Economic Cooperation , are explored in shaping the Cuban society and economy, including its health care system.
While the CMEA was an important source for economic growth, Cuban relations with the Soviet bloc had a damaging effect on the development of socialism in Cuba.
The adoption of the Soviet model of economic development fostered bureaucracy and demoralization of Cuban workers.
While the health care system is still consistently supported by public policy and its structure is sound, economic crisis undermines its material and moral foundations and threatens its achievements.
The future of the current Cuban health care system is intertwined with the potentials for its socialist development.

The area overlying the High Plains aquifer is one of the major agricultural regions in the world.
Water-level declines began in parts of the High Plains aquifer soon after the beginning of extensive ground-water irrigation.
In response to these water-level declines, the United States Geological Survey , in cooperation with numerous Federal, State, and local water-resources agencies, began monitoring more than 7,000 wells in 1988 to assess annual water-level change in the aquifer.
In parts of the area, farmers began using ground water for irrigation extensively in the 1930s and 1940s.
Ground-water withdrawals for irrigation and other uses are compiled and reported by the USGS and agencies in each State about every 5 years.
Ground-water withdrawals from the High Plains aquifer for irrigation increased from 4 to 19 million acre-feet from 1949 to 1974.
Ground-water withdrawals for irrigation in 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 were from 4 to 18 Estimated Colorado Golf Course Irrigation Water Use, 2005 USGS Publications Warehouse Ivahnenko, Tamara 2009-01-01 Golf course irrigation water-use data were collected as part of the United States Geological Survey National Water Use Program's 2005 compilation to provide baseline information, as no golf course irrigation water-use data have been reported in previous compilations.
For golf courses where no data were collected at all, an average 'per hole' coefficient, based on returned surveys from that same county, were applied.
In counties where no data were collected at all, a State average 'per hole' value of 13. acre-feet was used as the coefficient.
Ground water, potable water , and reclaimed wastewater, either partially or wholly, were source waters for the remaining courses.
In 2005, an estimated 5,647. acre-feet in Jefferson County, 5,402 acre-feet in Arapahoe County, and 4,473. acre-feet in El Paso County were used to irrigate the turf grass.

However, genetic information on the strains that circulate in the Cuban people is still unknown.
The present work constitutes the first study concerning the phylogenetic relationship of HIV-2 Cuban isolates conducted on 13 Cuban patients who were diagnosed with HIV-2.
The env sequences were analyzed for the construction of a phylogenetic tree with reference sequences of HIV-2.
Phylogenetic analysis of the env gene showed that all the Cuban sequences clustered in group A of HIV-2.
The analysis indicated several independent introductions of HIV-2 into Cuba.
The results of the study will reinforce the program on the epidemiological surveillance of the infection in Cuba and make possible further molecular evolutionary studies.

Italians had higher scores for restrained eating on the questionnaire than Cubans with a considerable effect size.
This trend was also found for emotional eating and binge eating, as well as number of current dieters, despite the fact that effect sizes were small.
On the other hand, Cubans, when compared to Italians reported higher scores for food thought suppression with reward responsiveness and restrained eating emerging as significant predictors of between-country differences.
To conclude, eating behaviors in Cubans could be different from those reported in European countries, perhaps as a consequence of Cuba’s recent history.
PMID:27725806 The Dynamics of Cuba Anticyclones and Interaction With the Loop Current/Florida Current System NASA Astrophysics Data System Kourafalou, Vassiliki; Androulidakis, Yannis; Le Hénaff, Matthieu; Kang, HeeSook 2017-10-01 Mesoscale anticyclonic eddies along the northern Cuban coast have been identified in the Straits of Florida, associated with the northward shift of the Florida Current and the anticyclonic curvature of the Loop Current at the western entrance of the Straits.
The dynamics of CubAN eddies and their interaction with the LC/FC system are described for the first time using satellite, drifter and buoy data, and a high-resolution model.
It is shown that the evolution of CubANs to the south of the FC front complements the evolution of cyclonic eddies to the north of the FC, advancing previous studies on synergy between FC meandering and eddy activity.
There are also mixed cases, when the process of LCE shedding has started, so a type ""A"" CubAN is being formed, in the presence of one or more eastward progressing type ""B"" eddies.
CubAN evolution is associated with an increased mixed layer and weaker stratification of the upper ocean along the eddy's track.
The cyclonic activity along the Cuban coast and wind-induced upwelling events also contribute to the evolution and fate of the CubAN eddies.

Retrospective study based on the National Inpatient Sample from 1997 through 2005.
The total ROP incidence was 0.17% overall and 15.58% for premature infants with length of stay of more than 28 days.
Our results conclusively demonstrated the importance of low birth weight as a risk for ROP development in infants with length of stay of more than 28 days, as well as association with respiratory conditions, fetal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and blood transfer.
An interesting finding was the protective effect conferred by hypoxia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hemolytic disease of the newborn.
Infants with ROP had a higher incidence of undergoing laser photocoagulation therapy, pars plana vitrectomy, and scleral buckle surgery.
The multivariate analysis emphasizes the role of birth weight in extended-stay infants, as well as respiratory conditions, fetal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and blood transfer.

Sedimentation in Lago Dos Bocas reservoir has reduced the storage capacity from 37.50 million cubic meters in 1942 to 17.26 million cubic meters in 2005, which represents a storage loss of about 54 percent.
The long-term annual water-storage capacity loss rate remained nearly constant at about 320,000 cubic meters per year to about 1997.
The inter-survey sedimentation rate between 1997 and 1999, however, is higher than the long-term rate at about 1.09 million cubic meters per year.
Between 1999 and 2005 the rate is lower than the long-term rate at about 0.13 million cubic meters per year.
The Lago Dos Bocas effective sediment-contributing drainage area had an average sediment yield of about 1,400 cubic meters per square kilometer per year between 1942 and 1997.
This rate increased substantially by 1999 to about 4,600 cubic meters per square kilometer per year, probably resulting from the historical magnitude floods caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998.

PubMed Rezvani, Zolfaghar; Arjomandi Rad, Farzad; Khodam, Fatemeh 2015-01-21 In the present work, Mg2Al-layered double hydroxide intercalated with cubane-1,4-dicarboxylate anions was prepared from the reaction of solutions of Mg and Al nitrate salts with an alkaline solution of cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid by using the coprecipitation method.
The increase in the basal spacing of LDHs from 8.67 Å to 13.40 Å shows that cubane-dc anions were successfully incorporated into the interlayer space.
Thermogravimetric analyses confirm that the thermal stability of the intercalated cubane-dc anions is greater than that of the pure form before intercalation because of host-guest interactions involving hydrogen bonds.
The interlayer structure, hydrogen bonding, and subsequent distension of LDH compounds containing cubane-dc anions were shown by molecular simulation.
The RDF , mean square displacement , and self-diffusion coefficient were calculated using the trajectory files on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, and the results indicated that the cubane-dc anions were more stable when intercalated into the LDH layers.
A good agreement was obtained between calculated and measured X-ray diffraction patterns and between experimental and calculated basal spacings.
These data were used to characterize current water-quality conditions, to establish a baseline for future comparisons, and to describe trends in surface-water quality.
The data also were used to assess the effects of watershed characteristics on surface-water quality and to inform future watershed management.

This report describes the water-use categories and data elements required for the 2005 national water-use compilation conducted as part of the USGS National Water Use Information Program.
The report identifies sources of water-use information, provides standard methods and techniques for estimating water use at the county level, and outlines steps for preparing documentation for the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.
As part of this USGS program to document water use on a national scale for the year 2005, estimates of water withdrawals for the categories of public supply, self-supplied domestic, industrial, irrigation, and thermoelectric power at the county level are prepared for each State using the guidelines in this report.
Estimates of water withdrawals for aquaculture, livestock, and mining are prepared for each State using a county-based national model, although study chiefs in each State have the option of producing independent county estimates of water withdrawals for these categories.
Estimates of deliveries of water from public supplies for domestic use by county also will be prepared for each State for 2005.
As a result, domestic water use can be determined for each State by combining self-supplied domestic withdrawals and publicly supplied domestic deliveries.
Fresh ground-water and surfacewater estimates will be prepared for all categories of use; and saline ground-water and surface-water estimates by county will be prepared for the categories of public supply, industrial, and thermoelectric power.
If data are available, reclaimed wastewater use will be compiled for the industrial and irrigation categories.
Optional water-use categories are commercial, hydroelectric power, and wastewater treatment.

PubMed Strug, David L 2017-03-01 This paper discusses the economic reforms initiated by Cuban President Raúl Castro in 2008 and its effect on the country's fast-growing, vulnerable population of older persons 60+ years of age.
These two factors combined have reduced the proportion of the population in the work force.
Population aging is a major reason why the government has introduced structural reforms and reduced social spending, which have weakened the welfare state on which older persons depend.
Policy makers need to address the impact the reforms are having on older Cubans and consider them as active participants in economic reform.
Data for this paper come from qualitative, case study research carried out in Havana between the years 2008-15 and from a review of the literature on aging and economic reforms in Cuba.

PubMed Feibel, Robert M; Arch, Jennifer 2018-06-12 This article reviews the history of Cuban Epidemic Optic Neuropathy , which caused visual loss, peripheral neuralgias, and other neurological symptoms in over 50,000 persons, an incidence of almost 0.5% of the entire population.
We then relate the Cuban epidemic to the fictional epidemic of contagious blindness depicted by Nobel Laureate José Saramago in his 1995 novel Blindness.
This novel describes an unnamed modern city in which all inhabitants, except the ophthalmologist's wife, are affected with a white, not black, blindness.
The sources for the Cuban epidemic were an extensive review of the published literature and personal communications with physicians who treated these patients.
Both authors have analyzed the novel and the critical literature about Saramago's writings.
Though Saramago uses the epidemic of blindness as an allegory to comment on human weakness and immorality, he may also have known of the actual Cuban epidemic.
Saramago was a lifelong member of the Communist party, as well as a friend of Fidel Castro and admirer of the Cuban government.
We have no proof that Blindness was influenced by the Cuban epidemic, but we find it plausible.
It is valuable to examine the real and fictional epidemics side by side, not least because Saramago's novel depicts the actions of an ophthalmologist during an epidemic of blindness.
Ophthalmologists may be interested in a novel that uses the language of eyes, vision, sight, and blindness extensively.

The North Cascade Range in the vicinity of South Cascade Glacier accumulated smaller than normal winter snowpacks during water years 2004 and 2005.
Correspondingly, the balance years 2004 and 2005 maximum winter snow balances of South Cascade Glacier, 2.08 and 1.97 meters water equivalent, respectively, were smaller than the average of such balances since 1959.
The 2004 glacier summer balance was the eleventh most negative during 1959 to 2005 and the 2005 glacier summer balance was the third most negative.
The relatively small winter snow balances and unusually negative summer balances of 2004 and 2005 led to an overall loss of glacier mass.
The 2004 and 2005 glacier net balances, -1.65 and -2.45 meters water equivalent, respectively, were the seventh and second most negative during 1953 to 2005.
For both balance years, the accumulation area ratio was less than 0.05 and the equilibrium line altitude was higher than the glacier.
The unusually negative 2004 and 2005 glacier net balances, combined with a negative balance previously reported for 2003, resulted in a cumulative 3-year net balance of -6.20 meters water equivalent.
No equal or greater 3-year mass loss has occurred previously during the more than 4 decades of United States Geological Survey mass-balance measurements at South Cascade Glacier.
Accompanying the glacier mass losses were retreat of the terminus and reduction of total glacier area.
The terminus retreated at a rate of about 17 meters per year during balance year 2004 and 15 meters per year during balance year 2005.
Glacier area near the end of balance years 2004 and 2005 was 1.82 and 1.75 square kilometers, respectively.
Despite repeated occurrences in several states over many years, it was not believed that Cuban treefrogs had successfully established outside of Florida in the mainland United States.
The impacts of this population on native treefrogs in this area is unknown but possibly severe as indicated by the paucity of observations of native treefrogs during our surveys.
Eradication of this seemingly established population is improbable, but continued surveys will facilitate learning about the ecology and genetics of this novel population.
Seven smaller depressions are evident on the 2005 Sparta-Memphis potentiometric-surface map located in Webster and Winn Parishes, Louisiana, and Calhoun, Cleveland, western Columbia, Desha, and Lafayette Counties, Arkansas.
The depression in Calhoun County initially was shown in the 1996-1997 potentiometric surface.
The depression in Desha County initially was shown in the 1999 potentiometric surface.
The depressions in Webster and Winn Parishes were shown as early as 1975.
The depressions in Cleveland, western Columbia, and Lafayette Counties initially were shown in the 2003 potentiometric surface.
The difference in water levels between 2001 and 2005 ranged from -30. to 44. feet.
The largest rise of 44. feet in water level measured was in Union County in Arkansas.
The largest decline of 30. feet in water level measured was in Columbia County in Arkansas.
Areas with a general rise in water levels in Arkansas are shown in Arkansas, Columbia, Craighead, Jefferson, Prairie, and the western half of Union Counties.
The area around west-central Union County had rises as much as 44. feet, with seven wells showing a rise of 20 feet or greater, which is an annual rise of 5 feet or greater.
Areas in Arkansas with a general decline in water level are shown in western Bradley, eastern Calhoun, Cleveland, Cross, Desha, Drew, Lafayette, Lee, Lincoln, Lonoke, Poinsett, and the eastern half of Union Counties.
In Louisiana, the water-level difference map showed a general rise in water levels in northern Claiborne, northern Webster, and northwestern Union Parishes mainly because of a decrease in industrial withdrawals in southern Arkansas, particularly Union County.
It was hypothesized that the strict control practices described for the Cuban culture would foster greater field-dependence in their adolescents than would the practice of a U S. born group.
PubMed Zhang, Zhuoying; Shi, Minjun; Yang, Hong 2012-11-20 Beijing has been experiencing increasing water shortage alongside its astonishing economic growth over the past decades.
This study conducts a quasi-dynamic input-output analysis to investigate changes in Beijing's water footprint and decompose the effects of contributing factors to the changes during 1997-2007.
The analysis distinguishes ""internal"" and ""external"" WF to depict connections of Beijing's water use with outside.
The results show an increase in Beijing's WF from 4342 million m in 1997 to 5748 million m in 2007.
Almost all the increase was attributable to the expansion of the external WF, while the internal WF only changed slightly, indicating a growing dependence of Beijing on external water resources.
However, these effects were not sufficient to reverse the expansion of Beijing's WF resulted from the scale effect induced by expansion of final demand and the economic system efficiency effect associated with the growth of trade between Beijing and outside.
The study provides insights into Beijing's water challenge and sheds lights on the combating strategies for the future.
It is also an endeavor to enhance the policy relevance of the WF studies.

Despite its rarity, in 2012 seven individuals of S cubanus were captured and sampled successfully for DNA analysis, providing new insights into the evolutionary origin of this species and into the origins of the Caribbean fauna, which remain controversial.
We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of five nuclear genes from 35 species of the mammalian order Eulipotyphla.
Based on Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses, the family Solenodontidae diverged from other eulipotyphlan in the Paleocene, after the bolide impact on the Yucatan Peninsula, and S cubanus diverged from the Hispaniolan solenodon in the Early Pliocene.
The strikingly recent divergence time estimates suggest that S cubanus and its ancestral lineage originated via over-water dispersal rather than vicariance events, as had previously been hypothesised.

Insights into the Toxic-Nutritional Hypothesis through International Collaboration.
PubMed González-Quevedo, Alina; Santiesteban-Freixas, Rosaralis; Eells, Janis T; Lima, Lucimey; Sadun, Alfredo A 2018-04-01 From 1991 to 1993, an epidemic of optic and peripheral neuropathy-the largest of the century-broke out in Cuba, affecting more than 50,000 people.
Initially the main clinical features were decreased visual acuity, central and cecocentral scotomas, impaired color vision and absence of the papillomacular bundle.
Due to the magnitude of the epidemic, the Cuban government requested help from the international community at the 46th World Health Assembly in 1993.
PAHO and WHO immediately responded by sending a mission of international experts.
This paper describes their multidisciplinary work, particularly devoted to investigating the hypothesis of a primary toxic-nutritional cause of the epidemic.
Clinical aspects, such as case definition and clinical description, were vital issues from the start.
Cuban physicians who first examined patients received a clear impression of its toxic-nutritional origin, later confirmed by international experts.
Research then focused on the mechanisms contributing to damage under the toxic-nutritional hypothesis.
These included injuries to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway, nutritional deficiencies, excitotoxicity, formate toxicity and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier.
It was expected that the results of such international collaboration into this major health problem would also shed more light on mechanisms underlying other nutritional or tropical myeloneuropathies.
Streamflow was measured or estimated by the USGS following standard methods at 23 streamgage stations; 10 of these stations were also equipped with instrumentation capable of continuously monitoring specific conductance.
Water-quality samples were also collected at 37 sampling stations in the Scituate Reservoir drainage area by the Providence Water Supply Board during WY 2005 as part of a long-term sampling program.
Water-quality data are summarized by using values of central tendency and are used, in combination with measured streamflows, to calculate loads and yields of selected water-quality constituents for WY 2005.
The largest tributary to the reservoir contributed about 30 cubic feet per second to the reservoir during WY 2005.
For the same time period, annual mean streamflows1 measured for the other monitoring stations in this study ranged from about 0.42 to 19 ft3/s.
Together, tributary streams transported about 1,300,000 kilograms of sodium and 2,000,000 kg of chloride to the Scituate Reservoir during WY 2005; sodium and chloride yields for the tributaries ranged from 13,000 to 77,000 kilograms per square mile and from 19,000 to 130,000 kg/mi2, respectively.

The survey data recorded over a 9-year period, 1997 to 2005, was summarized.
The format provided by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology was adapted with the correspondent permission.
The mean annual incidence rate of cryptococcosis in the general population was 2.
Laboratory data showed that direct examination of cerebrospinal fluid was positive in 92.8% cases and Cryptococcus was recovered in 90.3% of the cases.
Cryptococcal antigen reactivity was 98.9% in CSF and 93.7% in serum samples.
As new data and methods became available, some of the original datasets were recompiled.
The most recent versions of these datasets were used in this fact sheet.
Values on these datasets and in this fact sheet may not sum to the indicated total due to independent rounding.
Due to variations in data requirements, collection methods, terminology, and data sources, the direct assessment of water-use trends between compilations is difficult.
This fact sheet focuses on the trends in total State and public-supplied populations, freshwater withdrawals and use, public-supply withdrawals and deliveries, and crop irrigation withdrawals and acreage in Washington from 1985 through 2005.
These four categories were included in all five compilations and were the most stable in terms of data requirements, collection methods, terminology, and data sources.

Such profiles are particularly important in volleyball because absolute size contributes a significant percentage of total variance associated with athletic success.
As in other team sports, volleyball players' kinanthropometric attributes correlate with the game's tactical demands.
From 1992 through 2000, the Cuban women's volleyball team achieved top global performance, winning first place in three successive Summer Olympic Games.
Describe the kinanthropometric profiles of Cuban women Olympic volleyball champions during 1992-2000 and compare these by position played.
Measurements were taken of body composition, somatotype, proportionality and several anthropometric indicators in 41 Cuban women volleyball players, grouped by playing position.
Analysis of variance was used to compare means for different positions for the variables weight; height; percent adipose, muscle and bone mass; body mass index; and muscle-to-bone ratio.
Discriminant analysis was performed to identify anthropometric dimensions differentiating playing positions , using p<0.05 as significance threshold.
Centers presented greater absolute size and higher average adipose and bone mass.
Classified by position, centers and spikers presented an average mesomorphic-ectomorphic somatotype, and setters were balanced mesomorphic.
On assessing Somatotype Attitudinal Mean , centers and spikers showed more intrapositional homogeneity than that of setters.

Estimates of water withdrawals for livestock are needed for water planning and management.
This report documents a method used to estimate withdrawals of fresh ground water and surface water for livestock in 2005 for each county and county equivalent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.
Use of the method described in this report could result in more consistent water-withdrawal estimates for livestock that can be used by water managers and planners to determine water needs and trends across the United States.
Water withdrawals for livestock in 2005 were estimated by using water-use coefficients, in gallons per head per day for each animal type, and livestock-population data.
Coefficients for various livestock for most States were obtained from United States Geological Survey water-use program personnel or United States Geological Survey water-use publications.
When no coefficient was available for an animal type in a State, the median value of reported coefficients for that animal was used.
Livestock-population data were provided by the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
County estimates were further divided into ground-water and surface-water withdrawals for each county and county equivalent.
County totals from 2005 were compared to county totals from 1995 and 2000.
Of total water withdrawals, about 78 percent were used for cooling at a power plant, 9 percent were withdrawn by public suppliers, about 5 percent were withdrawn for domestic use, about 3 percent were withdrawn for use at fish hatcheries, and the remaining 5 percent were divided among commercial/industrial, irrigation, livestock, and snowmaking uses.
About 49 percent of the population of Vermont was supplied with drinking water by a public supplier, and 51 percent was self supplied.
Some of the Minor Civil Divisions that had large self-supplied populations were located near the major cities of St.
Albans, Burlington, Montpelier, Barre, and Rutland, where the cities themselves were served largely by public supply, but the surrounding areas were not.
Most MCDs where withdrawals by community water systems totaled more than 1 Mgal/d used predominantly surface water, and those where withdrawals by community water systems totaled 1 Mgal/d or less used predominantly groundwater.
Withdrawals of groundwater greater than 1 Mgal/d were made in Middlebury, Bethel, Hartford, Springfield, and Bennington, and withdrawals of surface water greater than 2 Mgal/d were made in Grand Isle, Burlington, South Burlington, Mendon, Brattleboro, and Vernon.
Mgal/d are projected for 2020 for Fairfax, Hardwick, Middlebury, Sharon, Proctor, Springfield, and Manchester.
The largest projected increases in surface-water withdrawals from 2005 to 2020 are located along the center axis of the Green Mountains in the ski-area towns of Stowe, Warren, Mendon, Killington, and Wilmington.
In 2005, withdrawals were at least 1 Mgal/d greater than return flows in South Burlington, Waterford, Orange, Mendon, Woodford, and Vernon.
Many of the companies producing MRI equipment were unable to deliver this technology to Cuba due to the bloqueo, the United States embargo against Cuba.
Those who were later to advance the project's progress in scientific technology initially regarded the implementation of such a project in a developing country as unfeasible due to its complexity.
But Fidel's belief and confidence and in turn the Cuban scientists' commitment to him and to Cuban science proved to be an undeniable factors for its success.

Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic environment and physical activity in Cuban immigrants.
PubMed Affuso, Olivia; Singleton, Chelsea R; Brown, Scott C; Perrino, Tatiana; Huang, Shi; Szapocznik, José 2016-12-01 Physical inactivity is a major public health concern because it is a determinant of obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases.
Few longitudinal studies have examined the association between neighborhood socioeconomic environment and change in physical activity behaviors.
Additionally, few studies have examined this association in immigrant groups or Hispanic subgroups such as Cubans.
This research aimed to determine if neighborhood SES is associated with longitudinal change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among Cuban immigrants who participate in the Cuban Health Study in Miami, Florida.
A neighborhood SES score was calculated for each participant's residential census tract from American Community Survey data on median household income, median housing value, educational attainment and occupation.
The neighborhood SES score was grouped into tertiles, reflecting low, moderate and high neighborhood SES environment.
Multilevel linear models were used to examine the relationship between neighborhood SES and change in MVPA over 24 months.
In Cuban immigrants, longitudinal change in MVPA may not vary by neighborhood socioeconomic environment.

Neutron scattering gives direct evidence of the free rotation of fullerenes and of the libration of cubanes in the high-temperature phase, validating the “rotor-stator” description of this molecular system.
X-ray diffuse scattering shows that orientational disorder survives the order/disorder transition in the low-temperature phase, although the loss of fullerene isotropic rotational diffusion is featured by the appearance of a 2. meV mode in the INS spectra.
The coupling between INS and simulations allows identifying a degeneracy lift of the cubane librations in the low temperature phase, which is used as a tool for probing the environment of cubane in this phase and for getting further insights into the phase transition mechanism.
Although John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev both worked to avoid nuclear war, the stress and exhaustion of the negotiating process created serious blunders.
Community and federal collaboration to assess pregnancy outcomes in Alaska Native women, 1997-2005.
PubMed Kim, Shin Y; England, Lucinda J; Shapiro-Mendoza, Carrie K; Wilson, Hoyt G; Klejka, Joseph; Tucker, Myra; Lewis, Claire; Kendrick, Juliette S 2014-04-01 The objectives are to report the estimated prevalence of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a defined population of Alaska Native women and also examine factors contributing to an intensive and successful collaboration between a tribal health center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Investigators abstracted medical record data from a random sample of singleton deliveries to residents of the study region occurring between 1997 and 2005.
We used descriptive statistics to estimate the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of selected pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Pregnancy complication rates were 5.9% for gestational diabetes mellitus, 6.1% for maternal chronic hypertension and 11.5% for pregnancy associated hypertension, and 22.9% for anemia.
The cesarean section rate was 5.5% and 3.8% of newborns weighed >4,500 Few previous studies reported pregnancy outcomes among Alaska Native women in a specific geographic region of Alaska and regarding the health needs in this population.
We highlight components of our collaboration that contributed to the success of the study.
Studies focusing on special populations such as Alaska Native women are feasible and can provide important information on health indicators at the local level.
As a followup, 19 wells were sampled from June through August 2002; 7 were wells previously reported to have had high arsenic concentrations; 7 were near other wells reported to have high concentrations, and the remaining 5 were in areas where detectable concentrations of arsenic were suspected.
Arsenic concentrations near 10 µg/L were detected at only 2 of the 19 wells sampled; arsenic concentrations in samples from the remaining 17 wells were reported as less than the USGS Central Laboratory reporting limits of 2 µg/L or 4 µg/L.The elevated concentrations previously reported for at least three of the wells were due to incompletely flushed carbon filters in the supply-well system or were typographical errors.
A decrease in arsenic concentration was indicated at six of the seven resampled wells; no reasons are apparent.
Arsenic concentrations in ground water that exceed drinking-water guidelines were found only at one site.
On the basis of limited sampling data available for this study, the concentrations of arsenic above drinking-water standards do not appear to indicate a countywide problem with regards to arsenic concentrations in ground water.
The generality of reduced cluster stabilization has been examined with MoFe3S4 clusters.
Reaction of single cubane 1+ and edge-bridged double cubane with cyanide in acetonitrile affords 2− and 4− , respectively.
Clusters were isolated in ca.–90% yields as Et4N+ or Bu4N+ salts; Clusters 3 and 5 contain all-ferrous cores; 3 is the first 1+ cluster isolated in substance.
The structures of 2 and 3 are very similar; the volume of the reduced cluster core is slightly larger , a usual effect upon reduction of cubane-type Fe4S4 and MFe3S4 clusters.
Clusters with π-donor ligands exhibit larger isomer shifts and lower redox potentials while π-acceptor ligands induce smaller isomer shifts and higher redox potentials.

The national prescription registry was used to identify all claimed prescriptions for NSAIDs by the cohort until 2005.
By individual-level-linkage of nationwide registries, information was acquired concerning hospitalizations, comorbidity, concomitant pharmacotherapy and socioeconomic factors.
The population consisted of 4,614,807 individuals, of which 2,663,706 claimed at least one prescription for NSAID from 1997 to 2005.
Ibuprofen and diclofenac were the most frequently used non-selective NSAIDs, whereas rofecoxib and celecoxib were the most frequently used selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.
High doses were used in a relatively large proportion of the population and 54,373 claimed prescriptions for more than one NSAID at the same time.
Since NSAIDs have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, further research on the overall risk associated with these drugs on a national scale is needed.

PubMed Smith, Paul F; Kaplan, Christopher; Sheats, John E; Robinson, David M; McCool, Nicholas S; Mezle, Nicholas; Dismukes, G Charles 2014-02-17 The metal-oxo M4O4 ""cubane"" topology is of special significance to the field of water oxidation as it represents the merging of bioinspired structural principles derived from natural photosynthesis with successful artificial catalysts known to date.
Herein, we directly compare the rates of water oxidation/O2 evolution catalyzed by six cobalt-oxo clusters including the Co4O4 cubanes, Co4O444 and , using the common Ru3/S2O8 photo-oxidant assay.
At pH 8, the first-order rate constants for these cubanes differ by 2-fold, 0.030 and 0.015 s, respectively, reflecting the number of labile carboxylate sites that allow substrate water binding in a pre-equilibrium step before O2 release.
Kinetic results reveal a deprotonation step occurs on this pathway and that two electrons are removed before O2 evolution occurs.
The Co4O4 cubane core is shown to be the smallest catalytic unit for the intramolecular water oxidation pathway, as neither ""incomplete cubane"" trimers and nor ""half cubane"" dimers and were found capable of evolving O2, despite having the same ligand sets as their cubane counterparts.
Electrochemical studies reveal that oxidation of both cubanes to formally Co4 occurs readily, while neither dimers nor trimers are oxidized below 1.
Aquaculture production occurs under controlled feeding, sanitation, and harvesting procedures primarily in ponds, flow-through raceways, and, to a lesser extent, cages, net pens, and tanks.
Aquaculture ponds, raceways, and tanks usually require the withdrawal or diversion of water from a ground or surface source.
Most water withdrawn or diverted for aquaculture production is used to maintain pond levels and/or water quality.
Water typically is added for maintenance of levels, oxygenation, temperature control, and flushing of wastes.
This report documents methods used to estimate withdrawals of fresh ground water and surface water for aqua-culture in 2005 for each county and county-equivalent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands by using aquaculture statistics and estimated water-use coefficients and water-replacement rates.
County-level data for commercial and noncommercial operations compiled for the 2005 Census of Aquaculture were obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
Withdrawals of water used at commercial and noncommercial operations for aquaculture ponds, raceways, tanks, egg incubators, and pens and cages for alligators were estimated and totaled by ground-water or surface-water source for each county and county equivalent.
Use of the methods described in this report, when measured or reported data are unavailable, could result in more consistent water-withdrawal estimates for aquaculture that can be used by water managers and planners to determine water needs and trends across the United States.
The results of this study were distributed to United States Geological Survey water-use personnel in each State during 2007.

Bgal/d, or 95 percent of total withdrawals; about 24 Bgal/d was withdrawn from the Great Lakes or their connecting channels.
Total withdrawals, and total surface-water withdrawals, decreased 7 percent from 1995 to 2005, generally following the withdrawal trends of industrial use and that of the largest use-thermoelectric power.
Groundwater withdrawals increased 3 percent from 1995 to 2005 and 33 percent during 1985-2005.
The substantial increase since 1985 results primarily from increases in irrigation and self-supplied domestic withdrawals.
In 2005, withdrawals for public supply, domestic, and irrigation use accounted for 81 percent of groundwater withdrawals.
Bgal/d, or 72 percent of total withdrawals for 2005, was used for thermoelectric power.
Virtually all of this water was derived from surface water and used for once-through cooling at powerplants.
As such, the reuse potential of this water in the basin is high, with the majority of the withdrawn water returned to its surface-water source.
Public-supply withdrawals were 3.81 Bgal/d , with withdrawals declining by about 13 percent from 1995 to 2005.
In 2005, about 77 percent of the population in the Great Lakes Basin obtained drinking water from public suppliers, compared to about 78 percent in 1995 and 83 percent in 1985.
Surface water consistently provided about 88 percent of the total withdrawals for public supply since 1985.
Self-supplied industrial withdrawals in 2005 totaled 2.93 Bgal/d , possibly as much as 30 percent less than in 1995.
Energetic materials constitute quite a large class of compounds with a high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released.
We hereby use a combination of quantum chemistry methods to investigate feasibility and properties of carbon-nitrogen cubanes and multi-charged polynitrogen cations in the context of their synthesis and application as unprecedented energetic materials.
We show that the stored energy increases gradually with the nitrogen content increase.
Nitrogen-poor cubanes retain their stabilities in vacuum, even at elevated temperatures.
In turn, polynitrogen cations are highly unstable, except N8H+, despite they are isoelectronic to all-carbon cubane.
Kinetic stability of the cation decays drastically as its total charge increases.
High-level thermodynamic calculations revealed that large amounts of energy are liberated upon decompositions of polynitrogen cations, which produce molecular nitrogen, acetylene, and protons.
The present results bring a substantial insights to the design of novel high-energy compounds.
In 1997 and 2003 the presence of the High Salinity Shelf Water at the bottom depth near the sill was traced by both physical and chemical measurements.
In 2001 the Modified Shelf Water, characterized by warmer temperature and by a lower dissolved oxygen content than High Salinity Shelf Water, was observed at the shelf edge.
The distribution of the chemical tracers together with the hydrographic observations showed recently formed Antarctic Bottom Water on the continental slope during all of the cruises.
These observations were confirmed by the extended optimum multiparameter analysis.
The calculated thickness of the new Antarctic Bottom Water, as well as the tracer content, were variable in time and in space.
The estimated volume of the new Antarctic Bottom Water and the export of dissolved oxygen and nutrient associated with the overflowing water were different over the examined period.
Domestic water use may be affected by a combination of several factors.
In terms of year-to-year variability in domestic per capita water use for the selected cities, the difference from the median ranged from ± 7 to ± 26 percent with an overall median variability of ± 14 percent.
As a percentage of total annual water use, median annual domestic water use for the selected cities ranged from 33 to 71 percent with an overall median of 57 percent.
Monthly production and water sales data were used to calculate daily per capita water use rates for the lowest 3 consecutive months and the highest 3 consecutive months of usage.
In general, the median domestic water use as a percentage of the median total water use for 16 selected cities was similar for the low-3 and high-3 periods.
Statistical analyses of combined data for the selected cities indicated that none of the socioeconomic variables, including cost of water, were potentially useful as determinants of domestic water use at the national level.
However, specific socioeconomic variables may be useful for the estimation of domestic water use at the State or local level.
Statistical analyses indicated that specific climatic variables may be useful for the estimation of domestic water use for some, but not all, of the United States and Cuban Scientists Forge Collaboration on Arbovirus Research.

Microwave Limb Sounder/El Nino Watch Water Vapor Measurement, October, 1997 NASA Technical Reports Server 1997-01-01 This image shows atmospheric water vapor in Earth's upper troposphere, about 10 kilometers above the surface, as measured by the Microwave Limb Sounder instrument flying aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite.
These data collected in early October 1997 indicate the presence of El Nino by showing a shift of humidity from west to east along the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
El Nino is the term used when the warmest equatorial Pacific Ocean water is displaced toward the east.
The areas of high atmospheric moisture correspond to areas of very warm ocean water.
Warmer water evaporates at a higher rate and the resulting warm moist air then rises, forming tall cloud towers.
In the tropics, the warm water and the resulting tall cloud towers typically produce large amounts of rain.
The MLS instrument, developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, measures humidity at the top of these clouds, which are very moist.
This rain is now occurring in the eastern Pacific Ocean and has left Indonesia unusually dry, resulting in the current drought in that region.

These data were collected to allow assessments of ground-water resources during activities to determine the potential suitability or development of Yucca Mountain for storing high-level nuclear waste.
Data collected from January through December 2005 are provided for ground-water levels at 35 boreholes and 1 fissure , ground-water discharge at 5 springs, ground-water levels and discharge at 1 flowing borehole, and total reported ground-water withdrawals within Crater Flat, Jackass Flats, Mercury Valley, and the Amargosa Desert.
Ground-water level, discharge, and withdrawal data collected by other agencies, or as part of other programs, are provided.
A statistical summary of ground-water levels at seven boreholes in Jackass Flats is presented for 1992-2005 to indicate potential effects of ground-water withdrawals associated with United States Department of Energy activities near Yucca Mountain.
The statistical summary includes the annual number of measurements; maximum, minimum, and median water-level altitudes; and average deviation of measured water-level altitudes compared to the 1992-93 baseline period.
At seven boreholes in Jackass Flats, median water levels for 2005 were slightly higher than the median water levels for 1992-93.
Estimates of water use and availability are an important part of planning for population and economic growth in the Tennessee River watershed in Alabama.
Total surface-water withdrawals were 5,139 Mgal/d, and total groundwater withdrawals were about 58 Mgal/d.
About 92 percent of the total water withdrawn was surface water used for once-through cooling for thermoelectric power generation.
Self-supplied industrial and public-supply water uses accounted for the next greatest uses of water, constituting approximately 49 and 42 percent, respectively, of the total water use excluding thermoelectric power use.
Summaries of water use by county and subbasin indicated the areas of greatest water withdrawals and use within the Tennessee River watershed.
Limestone , Jackson , and Colbert Counties were the counties with the greatest total water use in 2005 and had large amounts of water withdrawn for thermoelectric power generation.
The subbasin with the greatest total water use was Wheeler Lake in the Middle Tennessee—Elk subregion.
Wheeler Lake subbasin also had the greatest public-supply, irrigation, industrial, mining, and thermoelectric withdrawals of any subbasin in the Tennessee River watershed within Alabama.
Water-quality data include temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and concentrations of major ions, nutrients, and trace metals.
Lake sediment data include concentrations of trace metals and selected organic compounds.
The 1997-1998 El Nino, characterized by an anomalous increase in sea-surface temperature across the eastern and central tropical Pacific Ocean, is one of the strongest El Nino Southern Oscillation events of the century, comparable in magnitude to the 1982-1983 episode.
The major impact of the SST change has been the shift in the convection pattern from the western to the eastern Pacific affecting the response of rain-producing cumulonimbus.
As a result, there has been a significant increase in rainfall over the eastern Pacific and a decrease over the western Pacific and Indonesia.
The dryness in the Indonesian region has contributed to large-scale burning by uncontrolled wildfires in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo.
These conclusions are qualitatively consistent with the changes in atmospheric circulation derived from zonal and vertical wind data obtained from the Goddard Earth Observing System data assimilation analyses.

Nucleation rate computation from molecular simulations of TIP4P and TIP4P/2005 water model.
We found that the stability of any cluster, even if large, strongly depends on the energetic interactions with its vicinity, while the stable clusters change their composition almost entirely during nucleation.
Our nucleation rates are found to be 1.08×10 27 cm -3 s -1 for TIP4P and 2.30×10 27 cm -3 s -1 for TIP4P/2005.
The latter model prescribes a faster dynamics than the former, with a nucleation rate two times larger due to its higher electrostatic charges.
The non-equilibrium water densities derived from simulations and state-of-art equilibrium parameters from Vega and de Miguel are used for the classical nucleation theory prediction.
The CNT overestimates our results for both water models, where TIP4P/2005 shows largest discrepancy.
Our results complement earlier data at high nucleation rates and supersaturations in the Hale plot , and are consistent with MD data on the SPC/E and the TIP4P/2005 model.
Cuban Teachers in Jamaica and Namibia ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Hickling-Hudson, Anne 2004-01-01 Cuba has concentrated more than most developing countries on building a sound educational system, and as a result, it has been able to collaborate with other countries in their efforts to improve educational planning and practice.
We identify the maximum thermostat coupling time to guarantee proper thermostating for these simulations.
The presence of charged species has a dramatic impact on the dynamics, inducing a marked change towards a pure growth regime, which highlights the importance of ions in the formation of liquid droplets in the atmosphere.
It was found a small but noticeable sign preference at intermediate cluster sizes corresponding mostly to the formation of the second solvation shell around the ion.
The TIP4P/2005 water model predicts that anions induce faster formation of water clusters than cations of the same magnitude of charge.
The Co-OECs are active when residing at two oxidation levels above an all-Co resting state.
We demonstrate that the Co 2 2 cubane may be electrochemically generated and the electronic properties of this unique high-valent state may be probed by in situ spectroscopy.
Intervalence charge-transfer bands in the near-IR are observed for the Co 2 2 cubane, and spectroscopic analysis together with electrochemical kinetics measurements reveal a larger reorganization energy and a smaller electron transfer rate constant for the doubly versus singly oxidized cubane.
Spectroelectrochemical X-ray absorption data further reveal systematic spectral changes with successive oxidations from the cubane resting state.
Electronic structure calculations correlated to experimental data suggest that this state is best represented as a localized, antiferromagnetically coupled Co 2 dimer.
The exchange coupling in the cofacial Co 2 site allows for parallels to be drawn between the electronic structure of the Co 4 O 4 cubane model system and the high-valent active site of the Co-OEC, with specific emphasis on the manifestation of a doubly oxidized Co 2 center on O-O bond formation.
The interests, methodologies, and programs of Cuban geographers are similar to other countries, albeit at a truncated level due to the United States embargo.
We employ the TIP4P/2005 water model and show that this model reproduces qualitatively the LDA-HDA transformations observed experimentally.
At the rates explored, the HDA-to-LDA transformation is less pronounced than in experiments.
By studying the LDA-HDA transformations for a broad range of compression/decompression temperatures, we construct a ""P-T phase diagram"" for glassy water that is consistent with experiments and remarkably similar to that reported previously for ST2 water.
This phase diagram is not inconsistent with the possibility of TIP4P/2005 water exhibiting a liquid-liquid phase transition at low temperatures.
A comparison with previous MD simulation studies of SPC/E and ST2 water as well as experiments indicates that, overall, the TIP4P/2005 model performs better than the SPC/E and ST2 models.
The effects of cooling and compression rates as well as aging on our MD simulations results are also discussed.
The MD results are qualitatively robust under variations of cooling/compression rates and are not affected by aging the hyperquenched glass for at least 1 μs.

PubMed Shogren, C; Paine, T D 2016-02-01 The Cuban laurel thrips, Gynaikothrips ficorum Marchal , is a critical insect pest of Ficus microcarpa in California urban landscapes and production nurseries.
Female thrips feed and oviposit on young Ficus leaves, causing the expanding leaves to fold or curl into a discolored leaf gall.
There have been attempts to establish specialist predator natural enemies of the thrips, but no success has been reported.
We resampled the same areas in 2013-2014 where we had released Montandoniola confusa Streito and Matocq in southern California in 1995 but had been unable to recover individuals in 1997-1998.
Thrips galls were significantly reduced in all three of the locations in the recent samples compared with the earlier samples.
M confusa was present in all locations and appears to be providing successful biological control.
The value of the biological control, the difference between street trees in good foliage condition and trees with poor foliage, was $58,766,166.
If thrips damage reduced the foliage to very poor condition, the value of biological control was $73,402,683.
The benefit accrued for every dollar spent on the biological control of the thrips ranged from $950, if the foliage was in poor condition, to $1,187, if the foliage was in very poor condition.
Economic analyses that clearly demonstrate the very substantial rates of return on investment in successful biological control in urban forests provide compelling arguments for supporting future efforts.
This report presents the findings for July 2005 through June 2006 and summarizes the ground-water and surface-water conditions for 2005.
Water levels in 14 wells were continuously monitored in Dougherty County, Georgia.
Water levels in 12 of those wells were above normal, one was normal, and one was below normal.
Ground-water samples collected from the Upper Floridan aquifer indicate that nitrate levels have increased in 13 wells and decreased in two wells from a year earlier.
A trilinear diagram showing the percent composition of selected major cations and anions indicates that the ground-water quality of the Upper Floridan aquifer at the Albany wellfield is distinctly different from the water quality of the Flint River.
To improve the understanding of the ground-water flow system and nitrate movement in the Upper Floridan aquifer, the USGS is developing a ground-water flow model in the southwest Albany area, Georgia.

Nonfuels mining includes the extraction of ores, stone, sand, and gravel.
Fuels mining includes the extraction of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
Water is used for mineral extraction, quarrying, milling, and other operations directly associated with mining activities.
For petroleum and natural gas extraction, water often is injected for secondary oil or gas recovery.
Estimates of water withdrawals for mining are needed for water planning and management.
This report documents methods used to estimate withdrawals of fresh and saline groundwater and surface water for mining during 2005 for each county and county equivalent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.
Fresh and saline groundwater and surface-water withdrawals during 2005 for nonfuelsand coal-mining operations in each county or county equivalent in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands were estimated.
Fresh and saline groundwater withdrawals for oil and gas operations in counties of six states also were estimated.
Water withdrawals for nonfuels and coal mining were estimated by using mine-production data and water-use coefficients.
Production data for nonfuels mining included the mine location and weight of crude ore, rock, or mineral produced at each mine in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands during 2004.
Production data for coal mining included the weight, in metric tons, of coal produced in each county or county equivalent during 2004.
Water-use coefficients for mined commodities were compiled from various sources including published reports and written communications from United States Geological Survey National Water-use Information Program personnel in several states.
In 1997, 25 shallow monitoring wells were installed and sampled in five areas of urban development in Eagle, Grand, Gunnison, and Summit Counties, Colorado.
The results of this study indicate that the shallow ground water in the study area is suitable for most uses.
Nonparametric statistical methods showed that constituents and parameters measured in the shallow wells were often significantly different between the five developing urban areas.
Radon concentrations exceeded the proposed USEPA maximum contaminant level at all sites.
The presence of nutrients, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds indicate anthropogenic activities are affecting the shallow ground-water quality in the study area.
Nitrate as N concentrations greater than 2. mg/L were observed in ground water recharged between the 1980s and 1990s.
Low concentrations of methylene blue active substances were detected at a few sites.
Total coliform bacteria were detected at ten sites; however, E coli was not detected.
Continued monitoring is needed to assess the effects of increasing urban development on the shallow ground-water quality in the study area.

PubMed Spiegel, Jerry M; Yassi, Annalee 2004-01-01 It is widely recognized that Cuba, despite poor economic performance, has achieved and sustained health indices comparable to those in developed countries--the Cuban Paradox.
Cuba's exclusion from the mainstream of ""globalization,"" moreover, allows us to gain insights into the population health impact of policies that have accompanied globalization.
Cuba's experience challenges the conventional assumption that generating wealth is the fundamental precondition for improving health.
As peoples around the world search for cost-effective ways to improve well-being, they might want to learn how alternative public policy approaches, such as those used in Cuba, may be effective.
We therefore reviewed the literature on the health-wealth relationship in this globalizing era; then systematically examined public policy in Cuba, not only for health services but for non-medical determinants of health as well.
These included education, housing, nutrition, employment, etc. plus the community mobilization and social cohesion that the Cuban system has generated.
It appears that the active implementation of public policy affecting a wide variety of health determinants explains the Cuban paradox, and that the international community can learn from Cuba's experience.
The prospect for healthy public policy can thus exist within, rather than only on the margins of globalization.
The importance of monitoring how Cuba sustains such policies as it faces growing challenges in this globalizing era is increasingly worth observing.

Program directors of all known existing school… The cytotoxic effects of brown Cuban propolis depend on the nemorosone content and may be mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling.
In this study, brown Cuban propolis extracts were found cytotoxic against HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, in close association with the nemorosone contents.
In mitochondria isolated from rat liver the extracts displayed uncoupling activity, which was demonstrated by the increase in succinate-supported state 4 respiration rates, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca release from Ca-loaded mitochondria, and a marked ATP depletion.
As in cells, the degree of such mitotoxic events was closely correlated to the nemorosone content.
The propolis extracts that do not contain nemorosone were neither cytotoxic nor mitotoxic, except R-29, whose detrimental effect upon cells and mitochondria could be mediated by its isoflavonoids and chalcones components, well known mitochondrial uncouplers.
Our results at least partly unravel the cytotoxic mechanism of Cuban propolis, particularly regarding brown propolis, and raise concerns about the toxicological implication of Cuban propolis consumption.

In the autumn of 1997, the United States Geological Survey re-established two wetlands with different shallow water depths—about 25 and 55 centimeters deep—to investigate the potential to reverse subsidence of delta islands by preserving and accumulating organic substrates derived from plant biomass inputs over time.
Because cooler water temperatures can slow decomposition rates and increase accretion of plant biomass, water temperature was recorded from July 2005 to February 2008 in the deeper of the two wetlands, where areas of emergent and submerged vegetation persisted throughout the study, to assess differences in water temperature between the two vegetation types.
Water temperature was compared at three depths in the water column between areas of emergent and submerged vegetation and between areas near the water inflow and in the wetland interior in both vegetation types.
The latter comparison was a way of evaluating the effect of the length of time water had resided in the wetland on water temperatures.
There were statistically significant differences in water temperature at all depths between the two vegetation types.
Overall, in areas of emergent marsh vegetation, the mean water temperature at the surface was 1. degrees Celsius less than it was in areas of submerged vegetation; however, when analyses accounted for the changes in temperature due to seasonal and diurnal cycles, differences in the mean water temperature between the vegetation types were even greater than this.
For example, in the spring, the mean temperatures in areas of emergent marsh vegetation at the surface, mid-point, and near the sediment in the water column were 2.0, 2.3, and 2.

Given the small populations of PICs, the Cuban engagement could prove particularly significant for health systems development in the region.
This paper reviews the magnitude and form of Cuban medical cooperation in the Pacific and analyses its implications for health policy, human resource capacity and overall development assistance for health in the region.
Methods We reviewed both published and grey literature on health workforce in the Pacific including health workforce plans and human resource policy documents.
Further information was gathered through discussions with key stakeholders involved in health workforce development in the region.
Results Cuba formalised its relationship with PICs in September 2008 following the first Cuba-Pacific Islands ministerial meeting.
The cost of the Cuban medical cooperation to PICs comes in the form of countries providing benefits and paying allowances to in-country Cuban health workers and return airfares for their students in Cuba.
This has been seen by some PICs as a cheaper alternative to training doctors in other countries.
Conclusions The Cuban engagement with PICs, while smaller than engagement with other countries, presents several opportunities and challenges for health system strengthening in the region.
In particular, it allows PICs to increase their health workforce numbers at relatively low cost and extends delivery of health services to remote areas.
Analysis of Data From the National Health Interview Survey, 1997–2005 PubMed Central 2009-01-01 Objective.
I estimated the association between race and self-reported hypertension among Hispanics and non-Hispanics and determined whether this association was stronger among non-Hispanics.
With data from the 1997–2005 National Health Interview Survey, I used logistic regression to estimate the strength of the association between race/ethnicity and self-reported hypertension among United States adults.
Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks had 48% greater odds of reporting hypertension; Hispanic Whites had 23% lower odds.
The previously reported hypertension advantage of Hispanics holds for Hispanic Whites only.
As Hispanics continue their rapid growth in the United States, race may have important implications on their disease burden, because most United States health disparities are driven by race and its socially patterned experiences.

PubMed Kozísek, F; Jeligová, H; Dvoráková, A 2009-08-01 Despite considerable advances in drinking water safety assurance and adherence to the public health standards, waterborne diaseases outbreaks have still been observed even in industrialized countries.
The study objective was to map such outbreaks in the Czech Republic in 1995-2005.
In this study, an outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of disease than normally expected within a specific place over a given period of time and a waterborne disease is a disease where water is the vehicle or source of infection.
The data on waterborne outbreaks was obtained from the EPIDAT database information provided by epidemiologists of all regional public health authorities and the National Reference Laboratory for Legionella.
In 1995 2005, 33 outbreaks with water indicated as the route of transmission were recorded in the Czech Republic.
The leading cause was unsafe drinking water , mainly from wells ; nevertheless, the most serious consequences were observed in two outbreaks caused by microbiologically contaminated hot water.
Other sources of waterborne infection were mineral water springs, a swimming pool and a brook.
The highest number of outbreaks as well as the highest number of cases were reported in 1997.
Comparison of two five-year periods,e.96-2000 and 2001-2005, showed a nearly one third decrease in the total of outbreaks and a half reduction in the total of cases in the latter.
In view of the limited length of monitoring, it is not possible to say with certainty whether it is a random distribution or an actual trend.
Almost two thirds of cases were diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis of probable infectious origin and other frequent waterborne diseases were viral hepatitis A and bacillary dysentery.

Data obtained during these synoptic investigations provide a one-time look at the streamflow and water-quality conditions in the Big Black Creek Basin during a stable, base-flow period when streamflow originated only from ground-water discharge.
These data were used to assess the degree of water-quality degradation in the Big Black Creek Basin from land-use activities in the basin, including leakage of leachate from the Acmar Regional Landfill.
Biological data from the benthic invertebrate community investigation provided an assessment of the cumulative effects of stream conditions on organisms in the basin.
The synoptic measurement of streamflow at 28 sites was made during a period of baseflow on August 27, 1997.
Two stream reaches above the landfill lost water to the ground-water system, but those below the landfill had significantly higher ground-water gains.
If significant leakage of leachate from the landfill had occurred during the measurement period, the distribution of ground-water discharge suggests that leachate would travel relatively short distances before resurfacing as ground-water discharge to the stream.
Based on Alabama Department of Environmental Management criteria and on comparison with a nearby unimparied reference site, the benthic invertebrate communities at the sites sampled were considered unimpaired or only slightly impaired during the sample period.
This would imply that landfill and coal-mining activities did not have a detrimental effect on the benthic invertebrate communities at the time of the study.

This article describes the synthesis of new building blocks allowing their introduction into complex molecules, and explores their use as a means to modify the physicochemical properties of drug candidates and improve the quality of imaging agents.
In particular, the replacement of an aromatic ring with a bicyclopentane-1,3-diyl group improves aqueous solubility by at least 50-fold, and markedly decreases nonspecific binding as measured by CHI, the chromatographic hydrophobicity index on immobilized artificial membranes.
Structural variations with the bicyclooctane-1,4-diyl group led to more lipophilic molecules and did not show the same benefits regarding NSB or solubility, whereas substitutions with cubane-1,4-diyl showed improvements for both parameters.
These results confirm the potential advantages of both BCP and cubane motifs as bioisosteric replacements for optimizing para-phenyl-substituted molecules.
Data collected by the United States Geological Survey and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality, from May 2005 through September 2007 are presented in this report.
Three well clusters and four piezometers were installed at the Raleigh hydrogeologic research station along an assumed flow path from recharge to discharge areas.
Each well cluster includes four wells to monitor the regolith, transition zone, and shallow and deep bedrock.
Borehole, surface, and waterborne geophysics were conducted to examine the lithology and physical properties of the bedrock and to determine the aerial extent of near vertical diabase dikes.
Slug tests were conducted in the wells at each cluster to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the formation tapped by each well.
Periodic water-level altitudes were measured in all wells and in four piezometers.
Continuous hourly water levels were measured in wells for variable periods of time during the study, and a surface-water gage collected 15-minute stage data from April to June 2006.
In October 2005 and April 2006, water-quality samples were collected from a tributary and in all wells at the Raleigh hydrogeologic research station.
Continuous water-quality data were collected hourly in three wells from December 2005 through January 2007 and every 15 minutes in the tributary from May to June 2006.
In August 2006, streambed temperatures and drive-point ground-water samples were collected across lines of section spanning the Neuse River.
In a recently constructed permanent-pool impoundment, MeHg levels typically increased from inflow to outflow during 1997; this trend broke down from late 1998 to early 1999.
MeHg levels in the outflow reached seasonal maxima in mid-summer and late-winter , and are comparable to high levels observed in new hydroelectric reservoirs in Canada.
Overall, MeHg levels in both the inflow and outflow were significantly higher than in three nearby reference natural lakes.
Eleven older permanent-pool impoundments and six natural lakes in northwestern Minnesota were sampled five times.
Five of six lakes MeHg levels typical of uncontaminated lakes with highest levels in late winter, whereas a hypereutrophic lake had high levels with highest levels in mid-summer.
Seven temporary-pool impoundments were sampled during summer high-flow events.
PubMed Lara, Ariagna; Ponce de León, José Luis; Rodríguez, Rodet; Casane, Didier; Côté, Guillaume; Bernatchez, Louis; García-Machado, Erik 2010-05-01 Despite ongoing efforts to protect species and ecosystems in Cuba, habitat degradation, overuse and introduction of alien species have posed serious challenges to native freshwater fish species.
In spite of the accumulated knowledge on the systematics of this freshwater ichthyofauna, recent results suggested that we are far from having a complete picture of the Cuban freshwater fish diversity.
It is estimated that 40% of freshwater Cuban fish are endemic; however, this number may be even higher.
Analysis was based on Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances, and for four genera a character-based analysis was also used.
The mean conspecific, congeneric and confamiliar genetic distances were 0.6%, 9.1% and 20.2% respectively.
Molecular species identification was in concordance with current taxonomical classification in 96.4% of cases, and based on the neighbour-joining trees, in all but one instance, members of a given genera clustered within the same clade.
Within the genus Gambusia, genetic divergence analysis suggests that there may be at least four cryptic species.
In contrast, low genetic divergence and a lack of diagnostic sites suggest that Rivulus insulaepinorum may be conspecific with Rivulus cylindraceus.
Distance and character-based analysis were completely concordant, suggesting that they complement species identification.
Overall, the results evidenced the usefulness of the DNA barcodes for cataloguing Cuban freshwater fish species and for identifying those groups that deserve further taxonomic attention.

The aim of this research is to identify the most frequent viruses that affect transplanted Cuban children, by implementing a viral follow-up during the post-transplant period.
The study population included all Cuban pediatric patients who underwent solid organ transplantation between November 2009 and December 2012.
Viral genome of at least one virus was detected in 21 of 34 recipients, 18 patients excreted virus in urine while 12 presented DNAemia.
CMV and BKV were the most frequent viruses detected during the follow-up.
CMV was the virus mainly associated with clinical symptoms and DNAemia.
Its excretion in urine was associated with detection in plasma (p Cuban organ recipients.
A new species, Calisto occulta sp., is described from the northeastern Cuban mountains.
Calisto smintheus Bates, 1935 and Calisto bruneri, Michener 1949 are revised and revalidated.
A new status, the species level, is proposed for Calisto brochei, Torre 1973, Calisto muripetens, Bates 1939 and Calisto bradleyi, Munroe 1950.
The immature stages of Calisto smintheus, Calisto brochei,and Calisto occulta are described for the first time, and those of Calisto herophile, Hübner 1823 are redescribed.
Useful morphological characters for adults are the shape and conspicuousness of androconial patch, the number and relative size of white dots on underside of hindwing, the shape of aedeagus, the shape of digitiform projection of genitalia valve, the shape and relative size of tegumen and uncus, the relative size of female genitalia, the height of sterigmal ring dorsal crown of the latter, and the relative size of corpus bursae and ductus bursae.
For the immature stages, the most important characters are the color pattern of head capsule, the number and width of longitudinal lines of body, in the larvae; and the color pattern and the absence or presence of dorsal ridges on the abdomen of pupae.
The phylogenetic relationships between the Cuban Calisto species are quite robust and well-supported; however, conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear datasets was detected in Calisto brochei, Calisto muripetens and to a lesser degree in Calisto bradleyi.
Chemical analysis of plant material at the site was investigated as a preliminary tool to determine the extent of contamination at the site.
Thirty soil samples were collected from 15 soil cores during October 2005 and analyzed for trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds.
Five small-diameter, polyvinyl-chloride-cased wells were installed and ground-water samples were collected during December 2005 and May 2006 and analyzed for trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds.
Thirty Johnsongrass samples and 16 Coralberry samples were collected during September 2005 and analyzed for 53 constituents, including trace elements.
Results of the soil, ground-water, and plant data indicate that the areas of trace element and semivolatile organic compound contamination are located in the shallow soils near the threading barn.
Most of the trace-element concentrations in the soils on the study site were either similar to or less than trace-element concentrations in background soils.
Several trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Human Health Medium-Specific Screening Levels 2007 for Tap Water, Residential Soils, Industrial Indoor Soils, and Industrial Outdoor Soils.
There was little or no correlation between the plant and soil sample concentrations and the plant and ground-water concentrations based on the current sample size and study design.
The lack of correlation between trace-element concentrations in plants and soils, and plants and ground water indicate that plant sampling was not useful as a preliminary tool to assess contamination at the study site.
To assess the direct inputs during inundation, pesticide concentrations were analyzed in water, in suspended and bed-sediment samples collected from six source watersheds to the Yolo Bypass, and from three sites within the Bypass in 2004 and 2005.
Water samples were collected in February 2004 from the six input sites to the Bypass during the first flood event of the year representing pesticide inputs during high-flow events.
Samples were also collected along a transect across the Bypass in early March 2004 and from three sites within the Bypass in the spring of 2004 under low-flow conditions.
Low-flow data were used to understand potential pesticide contamination and its effects on native fish if water from these areas were used to flood the Bypass in dry years.
To assess loads of pesticides to the Bypass associated with suspended sediments, large-volume water samples were collected during high flows in 2004 and 2005 from three sites, whereas bed sediments were collected from six sites in the fall of 2004 during the dry season.
Thirteen current-use pesticides were detected in surface water samples collected during the study.
The highest pesticide concentrations detected at the input sites to the Bypass corresponded to the first high-flow event of the year.
The highest pesticide concentrations at the two sites sampled within the Bypass during the early spring were detected in mid-April following a major flood event as the water began to subside.
The pesticides detected and their concentrations in the surface waters varied by site; however, hexazinone and simazine were detected at all sites and at some of the highest concentrations.
Thirteen current-use pesticides and three organochlorine insecticides were detected in bed and suspended sediments collected in 2004 and 2005.
The pesticides detected and their concentrations varied by site and sediment Anglo-American and Cuban-American Teachers' Perception of Elementary School Boys and Girls.
The attitudes of Cubanand Anglo-American elementary school teachers concerning boys and girls were compared.
It appears to be generally accepted in Anglo-American culture that males are considered hostile and aggressive in school situations, while females are considered passive and conforming.
The characteristics presented for the long-term continuous-record stations are minimum daily streamflow; average daily streamflow; harmonic mean flow; 1-, 7-, 30-, and 90-day minimum average low flow with 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-year recurrence intervals; and 98-, 95-, 90-, 85-, 80-, 75-, 70-, 60-, 50-, 40-, 30-, 20-, and 10-percent daily duration flows.
The characteristics presented for the low-flow partial-record stations are minimum observed streamflow; estimated 1-, 7-, 30-, and 90-day minimum average low flow with 2-, 10-, and 20-year recurrence intervals; and estimated 98-, 95-, 90-, 85and 80-percent daily duration flows.
It is also the location of huge freshwater diversion facilities that entrain large numbers of fish.
Reducing the entrainment of listed fishes into these facilities has required curtailment of pumping, reducing the reliability of water deliveries.
We reviewed the first 5 years of the Environmental Water Account , a program instituted to resolve conflicts between protecting listed fishes and providing a reliable water supply.
The EWA provided fishery agencies with control over 0.2-0. km3 of water to be used for fish protection at no cost to users of exported water, and fish agencies guaranteed no disruption of water supply for fish protection.
The EWA was successful in reducing uncertainty in water supply; however, its contribution to the recovery of listed fishes was unclear.
Allocating EWA water for a single life stage of one species could provide larger gains in survival.
An optimally allocated EWA of equal size to the median of the first 5 years could increase abundance of juvenile delta smelt up to 7% in the springs of dry years.
If the EWA is to become a long-term program, estimates of efficacy should be refined.
The research results indicate that the average annual rice WF for the years 2005-2014 was about 7,580 m3/ton, of which 80% was blue, 17% was green, and 3% was grey.
This average annual footprint was about 5. times larger than the 2000-2004 average annual WF of rice for countries around the globe of 1325 m3/ton, of which 48% was green, 44% was blue, and 8% was grey.
The blue WF is the most important source of water for rice production in Taiwan.
The water consumption of the second crop is higher than that of the first crop.
The water use efficiency in the southern region of Taiwan is the best, while the northern part of Taiwan exhibits relatively high inefficiency.
The rates of change in cultivated land and rice production in Taiwan are decreasing in a stable manner.
The nexus of land, water, and food should be taken into consideration to protect water availability, maintain agricultural production, and avoid land degradation.
The results could offer useful information for agriculture policy and water resource management.

In women, there was a significant fall in haemoglobin and serum ferritin mean values from 13. to 13. g/dl and from 30. to 26. microg/l, respectively.
Iron status of women who want to serve as blood donors has deteriorated in the last 10 years, leading to an increased rejection due to haemoglobin below the inclusion criterion for blood donors.
In order to assess the water-quality data, the data were related to land use/land cover in the watershed.
Data from 81 water-quantity and water-quality sites, which consisted of 9 ground-water sites and 72 surface-water sites, were available for analysis.
However, the data were limited and frequently contained only one or two water-quality analyses per site.The Fraser River flows about 28 miles from its headwaters at the Continental Divide to the confluence with the Colorado River.
Ground-water resources in the watershed are used for residential and municipal drinking-water supplies.
Surface water is available for use, but water diversions in the upper parts of the watershed reduce the flow in the river.
Land use/land cover in the watershed is predominantly forested land, but increasing urban development has the potential to affect the quantity and quality of the water resources.Analysis of the limited ground-water data in the watershed indicates that changes in the land use/land cover affect the shallow ground-water quality.
Water-quality data from eight shallow monitoring wells in the alluvial aquifer show that iron and manganese concentrations exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency secondary maximum contaminant level.
Radon concentrations from these monitoring wells exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed maximum contaminant level.
The presence of volatile organic compounds at two monitoring wells in the watershed indicates that land use affects the shallow ground water.
In addition, bacteria detected in three samples are at concentrations that would be a concern for public health if the water was to be used as a drinking supply.

Major goals of this Water-Chemistry Monitoring Program were to identify streams exceeding or not meeting State or Federal water-quality standards and to assess if constituent concentrations reflecting water quality in these streams were increasing or decreasing over time.
As part of this program, water-quality data collected from 1998 to 2005 were analyzed to identify potential trends.
Sixteen water-quality constituents were analyzed at 31 sites across Michigan, 28 of which had sufficient data to analyze for trends.
The most prevalent trend detected throughout the state was for chloride.
Chloride trends were detected at 8 of the 28 sites; trends at 7 sites were increasing and the trend at 1 site was decreasing.
Although no trends were detected for various nitrogen species or phosphorus, these constituents were detected at levels greater than the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommendations for nutrients in water.
The results of the trend analysis will help to establish a baseline to evaluate future changes in water quality in Michigan streams.
These data represent that part of the National Water Data System operated by the United States Geological Survey and cooperating State and Federal agencies in Califomia.
Data were gathered from seven of eight High Rate X-Tags deployed on mature Cuban dogfish in the Exuma Sound, The Bahamas.
Recovery periods appeared variable between individuals and are likely driven by capture-and-handling stress and tag burden.
Application of the cross-correlation function to time-series depth and temperature data indicated three of the seven individuals suffered mortality through predation, which occurred during daytime, and suggests Cuban dogfish may constitute a proportion of deep-water apex predator diet in the Exuma Sound.
Vertical habitat data suggests Cuban dogfish are diel-vertical migrators, similar to other deep-water taxa, and exhibit a relatively broad temperature and depth range, which may be driven by preference for specific bathymetric structures.
These techniques provide an important first step into acquiring and presenting vertical habitat data for small-bodied, deep-water chondrichthyans, which can be directly applied to fisheries and ecosystem-based management approaches.
Ground-water data from that study are presented for water years 1997 through 2004 and include location, construction information, site plans, water levels, chemical and physical field measurements, and selected chemical analyses of water samples for 31 project wells.

PubMed Gómez, Fernando; Souissi, Sami 2008-09-01 The phytoplankton composition was investigated at two fixed stations in the north-eastern English Channel from November 1997 to December 2005.
The warmest temperatures in European historical records were recorded in August 2003.
This event was associated with an exceptional abundance peak of the dinoflagellates Akashiwo sanguinea ) and Ceratium fusus.
The lowest February temperatures for the 1998-2005 period were recorded in 2005, coinciding with the absence, for the first time in recent decades, of the spring bloom of Phaeocystis globosa.
The 'de-eutrophication', mainly the reduction of river nutrient loads, is progressively reducing the magnitude of the Phaeocystis blooms.
The delay in spring stratification, lower light availability due to turbidity and organic matter, and competition with tychoplanktonic diatoms contributed to retard the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom and disadvantage the development of Phaeocystis.
The summer 2003 European heat wave is expected to have had little influence on total annual primary production, because it occurred at mid-summer, the period of lowest annual phytoplankton abundance.
However, the anomalous weather in the second half of winter 2005 did affect the annual primary production.
All four solar radiometers retrieve CWV by measuring solar transmittance in the 0.94-micrometer water vapor absorption band.
As one of the steps in the CWV retrievals the aerosol component is subtracted from the total transmittance, in the 0.94-micrometer band.
The aerosol optical depth comparisons among the same four radiometers are presented elsewhere.
Without attempting to standardize on the same radiative transfer model and its underlying water vapor spectroscopy we found the CWV to agree within 0.13 cm for CWV values ranging from 1 to 5 cm.
Preliminary results obtained when using the same updated radiative transfer model with updated spectroscopy for all instruments will also be shown.
Comparisons to the microwave radiometer results will be included in the comparisons.

Water shows intriguing thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies in the supercooled liquid state.
One possible explanation of the origin of these anomalies lies in the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid phase transition between two forms of water.
While the anomalies are observed in experiments on bulk and confined water and by computer simulation studies of different water-like models, the existence of a LLPT in water is still debated.
Therefore, computer simulations of water models are crucial for exploring the possibility of the metastable LLPT and the nature of the anomalies.
In this work, we present new simulation results in the NVT ensemble for one of the most accurate classical molecular models of water, TIP4P/2005.
The results suggest the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point and are consistent with the existence of a LLPT in this model for the simulated length and time scales.
We have compared the behavior of TIP4P/2005 with other popular water-like models, namely, mW and ST2, and with real water, all of which are well described by two-state thermodynamics.
In view of the current debate involving different studies of TIP4P/2005, we discuss consequences of metastability and finite size in observing the liquid-liquid separation.
Here repeat hydrographic data collected in 1997 and 2014 near a deep fracture zone canyon in the eastern Brazil Basin are used to quantify the long-term change.
Significant changes are found in the Antarctic Bottom Water within the canyon.
In contrast, the change in the North Atlantic Deep Water has complicated spatial structure and is almost indistinguishable from zero at 95% confidence.
The resulting divergence in vertical displacement of the isopycnals modifies the local density stratification.
At its peak, the local squared buoyancy frequency near the canyon is reduced by about 20% from 1997 to 2014.
Similar reduction is found in the basinwide averaged profiles over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge flank along 25°W in years 1989, 2005, and 2014.
The observed changes in density stratification have important implications for internal tide generation and dissipation.
One hundred twenty-five water samples were collected from vernal pools and streams and analyzed as part of long-term monitoring projects of the United States Geological Survey Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative in the Northeast Region.
Field measurements of water temperature, specific conductance, and pH were made.
Laboratory analyses of the water samples included acid-neutralizing capacity, total Kjeldahl nitrogen , nitrite plus nitrate, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations.
Field and laboratory analytical results of water samples and quality-assurance data are presented.
All samples were analyzed for nutrients, major ions, trace metals, total and dissolved organic carbon, organic wastewater compounds, standard bacterial indicators, and the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen.
Standard bacterial indicators included total coliform, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens for the period 2005 through 2007, and total and fecal coliform, and enterococci for 2010.
In addition, enrichment of enterococci was performed on all surface-water samples collected during summer 2006, for detection of the human-associated enterococcal surface protein in Enterococcus faecium to assess the presence of sewage effluent in the Russian River.
Other analyses included organic wastewater compounds of bed sediment samples collected from four Russian River sites during 2005; carbon-13 isotopic values of the dissolved inorganic carbon for surface-water and groundwater samples collected during 2006; human-use pharmaceuticals on Russian River samples collected during 2007 and 2010; and the radiogenic isotopes tritium and carbon-14 for groundwater samples collected during 2008.
Cyclic O4 is of interest both as a potential HEDM species and because of its possible role in the ozone deficit problem in atmospheric chemistry.
We have studied the pathway for decomposition from the D minimum and also have found the approximate location of the singlet triplet crossing.
The barrier to decomposition is found to be about 9 kcal/mol and is not limited by the singlet triplet crossing.
For cyclic O3 we have focused on the crossings between the lowest five surfaces A, sA, A, B, and B) to provide some insight into ways to form cyclic O3 photochemically.
The calculations show that vertical excitation from the ground state to the A state leads to a crossing with the A manifold near the crossing region of the XA and 2A surfaces.
We have studied the decomposition pathways for cubane to benzene plus acetylene and to cyclooctatetraene.
We have also studied the ground and excited states for the photochemical ring closure step.
The state which closes to cubane can be described as a double triplet pi to pi* excitation with respect to the ground state.
Thus, this state has only a small oscillator strength with respect to the ground state.
However, there is a singlet pi to pi* state at nearly the same energy and excitation to this state followed by intersystem crossing could lead to the triplet pi to pi* state.
The computed Tolman length agrees quite well with a previous study of TIP4P/2005 water.
We also decompose the size-dependent surface free energy into energetic and entropic contributions for the mW and TIP4P/2005 force fields.
Despite having similar Tolman lengths, the energy-entropy decompositions are very different for the two force fields.
We discuss critical assumptions which lead to these findings and their relation to experiments on the nucleation of water droplets.
We also discuss surface broken bonds and structural correlations as possible explanations for the energetic and entropic contributions.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis patterns from Cuba's and Ecuador's patients with angiostrongyliasis; 8 Ecuadorian patients from two different outbreaks and 28 Cuban patients were studied.
Immunoglobulin A, IgM, IgG, and albumin were quantified by radial immunodiffusion.
A three-Ig pattern was the most frequent in the two groups, but IgM was presented in all Ecuadorian young mature patients; however, in the Cuban children, only 12 of 28 patients had intrathecal IgM, but about 90% had an IgA and IgG synthesis at time of later puncture.
This indicates that, with a larger amount of parasites ingested, clinical symptoms are more severe, and a higher frequency of intrathecal IgM synthesis could be observed.
This is discussed as a similarity with the intrathecal IgM synthesis in African trypanosomiasis.
The model is now calibrated for a total period of 42 months during the May through October periods of 7 hydrologically distinct years.
Based on a modified version of the United States Army Corps of Engineers model CE-QUAL-W2, this model provides a good fit to the measured data for streamflow, water temperature, and water quality constituents such as chloride, ammonia, nitrate, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, phytoplankton, and dissolved oxygen.
In particular, the model simulates ammonia concentrations and the effects of instream ammonia nitrification very well, which is critical to ongoing efforts to revise ammonia regulations for the Tualatin River.
In addition, the model simulates the timing, duration, and relative size of algal blooms with sufficient accuracy to provide important insights for regulators and managers of this river.Efforts to limit the size of algal blooms through phosphorus control measures are apparent in the model simulations, which show this limitation on algal growth.
About half of the error in the simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations is directly attributable to error in the size of the simulated phytoplankton population.
To achieve greater accuracy in simulating dissolved oxygen, therefore, it will be necessary to increase accuracy in the simulation of Tualatin River phytoplankton.Future efforts may include the introduction of multiple algal groups in the model.
Flow and water temperature data for model input were obtained from the Bureau of Reclamation Hydromet database and from measurements collected by the United States Geological Survey during field trips in autumn 2005.

The model was calibrated with data collected from April 1 through October 31, 2005, and tested with data collected from April 1 through October 31, 2006.
Sensitivity analysis results showed that for the parameters tested, daily maximum water temperature was most sensitive to changes in air temperature and solar radiation.

Cuban Amazon parrots are considered vulnerable, and multiple on-island captive populations have been established from wild-caught and confiscated individuals of unknown ancestry.
Using Bayesian clustering analysis, we detected 2 distinct clusters within the Zapata population, one of which was shared with Managua.
Overall mean kinship was low within each captive population , with 19 and 11 recommended breeding pairs in Zapata and Managua, respectively, ranked according to mean kinship and informed by molecular sexing.
Our results highlight the importance of understanding population history within ex situ management programs, while providing genetic information to directly inform Cuban parrot conservation.
We provide descriptions of glacier geometry to aid in estimation of conventional and reference surface mass balances and descriptions of ice motion to aid in the understanding of the glacier's response to its changing geometry.
These data provide annual estimates for area altitude distribution, equilibrium line altitude, and accumulation area ratio during the study interval.
New determinations of historical area altitude distributions are given for 1900 and annually from 1966 to 2001.
As original weather instrumentation is nearing the end of its deployment lifespan, we provide new estimates of overlap comparisons and precipitation catch efficiency.
During 1997-2001, Gulkana Glacier showed a continued and accelerated negative mass balance trend, especially below the equilibrium line altitude where thinning was pronounced.
Ice motion also slowed, which combined with the negative mass balance, resulted in glacier retreat under a warming climate.
Average annual runoff augmentation by glacier shrinkage for 1997-2001 was 25 percent compared to the previous average of 13 percent, in accordance with the measured glacier volume reductions.
Unfortunately, there is also the potential for release of these compounds to the environment and consequent adverse affects on wildlife and human populations.
Since 1993, the National Water-Quality Assessment program of the United States Geological Survey has evaluated water quality in agricultural areas to address these concerns.
The objective of this study is to evaluate trends in pesticide concentrations from 1993-2005 in the surficial and Upper Floridan aquifers of southwest Georgia using pesticide and pesticide degradate data collected for the NAWQA program.
Most of the significant trends were increasing concentrations of pesticides in older water; median pesticide concentrations did not differ between the surficial and Upper Floridan aquifers from 1993 and 2005.
Deethylatrazine, in the Upper Floridan aquifer, was the only compound that had a significant change in concentration during the study.
The limited number of wells with increases in pesticide concentrations suggest that ground-water sources of these compounds are not increasing in concentration over the time scale represented in this study.
These records of streamflow, ground-water levels, and quality of water provide the hydrologic information needed by State, local, and Federal agencies, and the private sector for developing and managing our Nation's land and water resources.
We re-analyzed data from the 25 studies used in the prior meta-analyses, correcting statistical and methodological limitations of previous efforts, and analyzed the chronicity data by discrete epochs.
The effect of mTBI immediately post injury was largest on Verbal and Visual Memory domains.
However, 3 months post injury all domains improved to show non-significant effect sizes.
These findings indicate that mTBI has an initial small effect on neuropsychological functioning that dissipates quickly.
Our findings may not apply to people with a history of multiple concussions or complicated mTBIs.

Detailed, comprehensive information on the use of water from Colorado's diverse surface-water and groundwater resources is important to water managers and planners by providing information they need to quantify current stresses and estimate and plan for future water needs.
A summary for instream water use for hydroelectric power generation also is included.
This report is published in cooperation with the Colorado Water Conservation Board.
In 2005, an estimated 13,581.22 million gallons per day was withdrawn from groundwater and surface-water sources in Colorado for the seven water-use categories.
Withdrawals from surface water represented about 11,035 Mgal/d, or 81. percent of the total, whereas withdrawals from groundwater sources represented an estimated 2,546 Mgal/d or 18. percent of the total.
Irrigation totaled 12,362.49 Mgal/d or 91 percent of the total water withdrawals in the State of Colorado.
PubMed Steichen, Jamie L; Windham, Rachel; Brinkmeyer, Robin; Quigg, Antonietta 2012-04-01 Ballast water exchange processes facilitate the dispersal and unnatural geographic expansion of phytoplankton, including harmful algal bloom species.
From 2005 to 2010, over 45,000 vessels travelled across Galveston Bay to the deep-water ports of Houston , Texas City and Galveston.
These vessels discharged ≈ 1. × 10 metrictons of ballast water; equivalent to ≈ 3.4% of the total volume of the Bay.
Over half of the ballast water discharged had a coastwise origin, 96% being from United States waters.
Galveston Bay has fewer non-indigenous species but receives a higher volume of ballast water discharge, relative to the highly invaded Chesapeake and San Francisco Bays.
Given the magnitude of shipping traffic, the role of Galveston Bay, both as a recipient and donor region of non-indigenous phytoplankton species is discussed here in terms of the invasibility risk to this system by way of ballast water.
The image shows sea surface height relative to normal ocean conditions on Nov., 1997.
The volume of extra warm surface water in the core of the El Nino continues to increase, especially in the area between 15 degrees south latitude and 15 degrees north latitude in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
The white and red areas indicate unusual patterns of heat storage; in the white areas, the sea surface is between 14 centimeters and 32 cm above normal; in the red areas, it is about 10 centimeters above normal.
The surface area covered by the warm water mass is about one-and-one-half times the size of the continental United States.
The added amount of oceanic warm water near the Americas, with a temperature between 21 to 30 degrees Celsius , is about 30 times the volume of water in all the United States Great Lakes combined.
The green areas indicate normal conditions, while purple means at least 18 centimeters below normal sea level.The El Nino phenomenon is thought to be triggered when the steady westward blowing trade winds weaken and even reverse direction.
This change in the winds allows a large mass of warm water that is normally located near Australia to move eastward along the equator until it reaches the coast of South America.
The displacement of so much warm water affects evaporation, where rain clouds form and, consequently, alters the typical atmospheric jet stream patterns around the world.

The purpose of this study was to determine the sanitary state of both bays during the flood and directly after it, the range of direction of distribution of the bacteriological contamination brought in by Vistula and Oder waters.
Bacteria of the Pseudomonas group , Enterobacteriaceae group , as well as enterococci and staphylococci were found in water samples from Pomeranian and Gdańsk Bays.
In the Pomeranian Bay the waters spread to the west , whereas in Gdańsk Bay they remained mainly in the coastal zone and then moved to the east.
An improvement in the sanitary state of both bay waters was observed at the end of August.
This report summarizes the water-quality characteristics and trophic conditions of those monitored lake basins throughout the State.
Regional variation of water quality in lake basins was examined by grouping on the basis of the five Omernik level III ecoregions within Michigan.
Concentrations of most constituents measured were significantly different between ecoregions.
Less regional variation of phosphorus concentrations was noted between Northern Lakes and Forests and North Central Hardwoods ecoregions during summer possibly because water samples were collected when lake productivity was high; hence the utilization of the limited amount of phosphorus by algae and macrophytes may have resulted in the more uniform concentrations between these two ecoregions.
Concentrations of common ions measured in the spring typically were higher in the Michigan southern Lower Peninsula in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains , Southern Michigan/Northern Indiana Drift Plains , and Huron/Erie Lake Plains ecoregions.
Most ions whose concentrations were less than the minimum reporting levels or were nondetectable were from lakes in the Michigan northern Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula in the Northern Lakes and Forests and North Central Hardwoods ecoregions.
Measured properties such as pH and specific conductance also showed a regional relation.
PubMed de Arazoza, Héctor; Lounes, Rachid; Pérez, Jorge; Hoang, Thu 2003-01-01 The data for the Cuban HIV-AIDS epidemic from 1986 to 2000 were presented.
With the purpose of evaluating the efficiency of the HIV detection system, two methods were used to estimate the size of the HIV-infected population, backcalculation and a dynamical model.
From these models it can be estimated that in the worst scenario 75% of the HIV-infected persons are known and in the best case 87% of the total number of persons that have been infected with HIV have been detected by the National Program.
These estimates can be taken as a measure of the efficiency of the detection program for HIV-infected persons.

PubMed González, Miguel A; Valeriani, Chantal; Caupin, Frédéric; Abascal, José L F 2016-08-07 The striking behavior of water has deserved it to be referred to as an ""anomalous"" liquid.
This makes difficult a complete experimental description since, beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily transforms into the stable one.
Theoretical interpretation of the water anomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water models.
In particular, one of the most popular theoretical scenarios-involving the existence of a liquid-liquid critical point -is disputed by several authors.
In this work, we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic relations which may shed light on this issue.
Interestingly, these relations may be tested in a region of the phase diagram which is outside the LLCP thus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region.
We have performed computer simulations to evaluate the TMD and TmD for a successful water model, namely, TIP4P/2005.
We have also evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative pressures.
The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of some response functions, in particular the isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant pressure, provides very useful information which may help to elucidate the validity of the theoretical proposals.
In this way, we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of the thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the vapor-liquid spinodal.
The overall picture shows a remarkable similarity with the corresponding one for the ST2 water model, for which the existence of a LLCP has been demonstrated in recent years.

PubMed Tu, Karen; Chen, Zhongliang; Lipscombe, Lorraine L 2008-05-20 Researchers have predicted that there will be a relative increase of 24% in the prevalence of hypertension in developed countries from 2000 to 2025.
Hypertension is a leading risk factor for death, stroke, cardiovascular disease and renal disease.
Thus, accurate estimates of the prevalence of hypertension in a population have important implications for public policy.
We sought to assess whether the estimated increase in the prevalence of hypertension has been underestimated.
We performed a population-based cohort study using linked administrative data for adults aged 20 years and older in Ontario, Canada's most populous province with more than 12 million residents.
Using a validated case-definition algorithm for hypertension, we examined trends in prevalence from 1995 to 2005 and in incidence from 1997 to 2004.
The number of adults with hypertension more than doubled from 1995 to 2005.
Our findings indicate that the rise in hypertension prevalence will likely far exceed the predicted prevalence for 2025.
Public health strategies to prevent and manage hypertension and its sequelae are urgently needed.
Methods We performed a population-based cohort study using linked administrative data for adults aged 20 years and older in Ontario, Canada's most populous province with more than 12 million residents.

That study used several methods to identify mixing zones of ground and geothermal waters using trace elements, chemical equilibria, water temperature, geothermometer estimates, and statistical techniques.
In some regions, geothermal sources influence the chemical quality of ground water used for drinking water supplies.
The Environmental Protection Agency has established primary drinking water standards for these, with the exception of boron and lithium.
Concentrations of some trace metals in geothermal water may exceed drinking water standards by several orders of magnitude.
Geothermal influences on water quality are likely to be localized, depending on directions of ground water flow, the relative volumes of geothermal sources and ground water originating from other sources, and depth below the surface from which water is withdrawn.
It is important to understand the areal extent of shallow mixing of geothermal water because it may have adverse chemical and aesthetic effects on domestic drinking water.
Multispectral satellite-imagery and National Wetlands Inventory data are used to delineate evaporative ground-water discharge areas on the Death Valley floor.
These areas are divided into five general units where ground-water discharge from ET is considered to be significant.
Annual ET was computed for ET units with micrometeorological data which were continuously measured at six instrumented sites.
Total ET was determined at sites that were chosen for their soiland vegetated-surface conditions, which include salt-encrusted playa 0.17 feet per year, bare-soil playa 0.21 feet per year, pickleweed 0.60 feet per year, Eagle Borax 1.99 feet per year, Mesquite Flat 2.86 feet per year, and Mesquite Flat mixed grasses 3.90 feet per year.
Precipitation, flooding, and ground-water discharge satisfy ET demand in Death Valley.
Ground-water discharge is estimated by deducting local precipitation and flooding from cumulative ET estimates.
Discharge rates from ET units were not estimated directly because the range of vegetation units far exceeded the five specific vegetation units that were measured.
Since then the incidence of meningococcal disease in Cuba has returned to the low levels recorded before the epidemic.
This study also showed that the application of VA-MENGOC-BC, the Cuban serogroup B and C vaccine, reduced the frequency and diversity of hypervirulent clonal complexes ST-32 and ST-41/44 and also affected other lineages.
Lineages ST-8 and ST-11 were no longer found during the postvaccination period.
The vaccine also affected the genetic composition of the carrier-associated meningococcal isolates.
Pike Hill was mined intermittently for copper from 1847 to 1919 and the site is known to be contributing trace elements and acidity to Pike Hill Brook and an unnamed tributary to Cookville Brook.
Streamflow, specific conductance, pH, and water temperature were measured continuously and monthly at three sites on Pike Hill Brook to determine the variation in these parameters over an annual cycle.
Synoptic water-quality sampling was done at 10 stream sites in October 2004, April 2005, and June 2005 and at 13 stream sites in August 2005 to characterize the quality of surface water in the watershed on a seasonal and spatial basis, as well as to assess the effects of wetlands on water quality.
Samples for analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate populations were collected at 11 stream sites in August 2005.
Concentrations of trace elements at sites in the Pike Hill Brook watershed exceeded USEPA National Recommended Water Quality Criteria acute and chronic toxicity standards for aluminum, iron, cadmium, copper, and zinc.
Concentrations of copper exceeded the chronic criteria in an unnamed tributary to Cookville Brook in one sample.
Concentrations of sulfate, calcium, aluminum, iron, cadmium, copper, and zinc decreased with distance from a site directly downstream from the mine , as a result of dilution and through sorption and precipitation of the trace elements.

The volume and duration of hydrometeorological standard and experimental data, characterizing the natural conditions and processes occurring in mountainous permafrost conditions, significantly exceed any counterparts elsewhere in the world.
The data are representative of mountainous territory of the North-East of Russia.
In 1997, the station was terminated, thereby leaving Russia without operating research watersheds in the permafrost zone.
This paper describes the dataset containing the series of daily runoff from 10 watersheds with an area from 0.27 to 21. km2, precipitation, meteorological observations, evaporation from soil and snow, snow surveys, soil thaw and freeze depths, and soil temperature for the period 1948-1997.
It also highlights the main historical stages of the station's existence, its work and scientific significance, and outlines the prospects for its future, where the Kolyma Water-Balance Station could be restored to the status of a scientific research watershed and become a valuable international centre for hydrological research in permafrost.
Water levels were measured from 50 discrete intervals within 18 boreholes and from 4 tunnel sites.
An interpretive database was constructed that describes water-level conditions for each water level measured in the Rainier Mesa area.
Multiple attributes were assigned to each water-level measurement in the database to describe the hydrologic conditions at the time of measurement.
General quality, temporal variability, regional significance, and hydrologic conditions are attributed for each water-level measurement.
The database also includes hydrograph narratives that describe the water-level history of each well.
To assist in this endeavor, the United States Geological Survey undertook a 3-year basinwide study to assess the water quality of surface water in the Onondaga Lake Basin.
The study quantified the relative contributions of nonpoint sources associated with the major land uses in the basin and also focused on known sources and presumed sinks of sediment and nutrient loads, which previously had not been evaluated.
More than 1,060 base-flow, stormflow, snowmelt, spring-water, and quality-assurance samples collected during the study were analyzed for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate-plus-nitrite, ammonia-plus-organic nitrogen, orthophosphate, phosphorus, and suspended sediment.
The concentration of total suspended solids was measured in selected samples.
Ninety-one additional samples were collected, including 80 samples from 4 county-operated sites, which were analyzed for suspended sediment or total suspended solids, and 8 precipitation and 3 snowpack samples, which were analyzed for nutrients.
Specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature were periodically measured in the field.
The mean concentrations of selected constituents in base-flow, stormflow, and snowmelt samples were related to the land use or land cover that either dominated the basin or had a substantial effect on the water quality of the basin.
Almost 40 percent of the Onondaga Lake Basin is forested, 30 percent is in agricultural uses, and almost 21 percent, including the city of Syracuse, is in developed uses.

The aim of the present study was to identify the conformational changes in the exon 3 region of the ATP7B gene and detect theL456V polymorphism in Cuban patients clinically diagnosed with Wilson's disease.
DNA extraction was performed through the salting-out method and the fragment of interest was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction technique.
The conformational shift changes in the exon 3 region and the presence of theL456V polymorphism were identified through the Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis.
The so-called b and c conformational shift changes, corresponding to theL456V polymorphism in the heterozygous and homozygous states, respectively, were identified.
TheL456V polymorphism was identified in 64 Cuban patients clinically diagnosed with Wilson's disease, making future molecular study through indirect methods possible.

The arthropod-born viral dengue disease is one such disease, with empirical and limited genetic evidence showing that African ancestry may be protective against the haemorrhagic phenotype.
Global ancestry analysis based on high-throughput genotyping in admixed populations can be used to test this hypothesis, while admixture mapping can map candidate protective genes.
Global ancestry was ascertained through ADMIXTURE and used in a fine-matched corrected association study, while local ancestry was inferred by the RFMix algorithm.
The expression of candidate genes was evaluated by RT-PCR in a Cuban dengue patient cohort and gene set enrichment analysis was performed in a Thai dengue transcriptome.
OSBPL10 and RXRA candidate genes were identified, with most significant SNPs placed in inferred weak enhancers, promoters and lncRNAs.
OSBPL10 had significantly lower expression in Africans than Europeans, while for RXRA several SNPs may differentially regulate its transcription between Africans and Europeans.
Their expression was confirmed to change through dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and to vary with disease severity in a Thai transcriptome dataset.
These genes interact in the LXR/RXR activation pathway that integrates lipid metabolism and immune functions, being a key player in dengue virus entrance into cells, its replication therein and in cytokine production.
Knockdown of OSBPL10 expression in THP-1 cells by two shRNAs followed by DENV2 infection tests led to a significant reduction in DENV replication, being a direct functional proof that the lower OSBPL10 expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease.

A Witness to French-Cuban Cooperation in Physics in the 1970s NASA Astrophysics Data System Cernogora, Jacqueline In France in 1968 many lively discussions and debates took place at several universities and laboratories in which official authority was questioned.
Forty years later, to avoid such questions, I will say right away ""from where"" I am writing this text, which is by no means an exhaustive study of French-Cuban collaboration in physics at that time, but rather a personal recollection.
But when, a decade later, the Soviet Union offered all the participant countries the chance to make use of its space vehicles and related installations so that their cosmonauts could carry out original scientific experiments in space, the situation had changed radically in Cuba.
Those experiments, and a further one that was also set up for the same space flight—but carried out during a later flight, as mentioned below—are historically important since they were the first in their class to be carried out by humans in space under microgravity conditions.
The Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait is the most commonly used instrument to assess food cravings as a multidimensional construct.
Its 39 items have an underlying nine-factor structure for both the original English and Spanish version; but subsequent studies yielded fewer factors.
The current study aimed to explore the factor structure of the Spanish version for both the FCQ-T and FCQ-T-reduced in a sample of 1241 Cuban adults.
Results showed a four-factor structure for the FCQ-T, which explained 55% of the variance.
Using the items of the FCQ-T-reduced only showed a one-factor structure, which explained 52% of the variance.
Both versions of the FCQ-T were positively correlated with body mass index , scores on the Food Thoughts Suppression Inventory and weight cycling.
In addition, women had higher scores than men and restrained eaters had higher scores than unrestrained eaters.
To summarize, results showed that the FCQ-T factor structure was significantly reduced in Cuban adults and the FCQ-T-reduced may represent a good alternative to efficiently assess food craving on a trait level.
Standardized instruments and measures constructed for this study were pretested.
Multivariate analyses showed that the ethnic groups differed in age, education, income, and number of persons giving care, while caregiver health and patient functioning were similar.
Controlling for demographics, differences in cultural variables were small.

Cubans had the greatest family stability, and worked the hardest, with the lowest sense of burden.
Caribbean Black caregivers lived in bigger families, were youngest, and their patients had the lowest cognitive status.
Burden was felt most by White caregivers who were older than the others.

Continuous records of surface-water discharge have been collected from 1976 to 2004 at Moenkopi Wash, 1996 to 2004 at Laguna Creek, 1993 to 2004 at Dinnebito Wash, 1994 to 2004 at Polacca Wash, and August 2004 to December 2004 at Pasture Canyon Spring.
Median flows for November, December, January, and February of each water year were used as an index of ground-water discharge to those streams.
Since 1995, the median winter flows have decreased for Moenkopi Wash, Dinnebito Wash, and Polacca Wash.
Since the first continuous record of surface-water discharge in 1997, there is no consistent trend in the median winter flow for Laguna Creek.

Bycatch was established as the cause of death for most of the individuals through typical indications of fisheries interactions, including net markings in the skin and around the flippers, and loss of tail flukes.
Local fishermen confirmed unusually large porpoise bycatch in nets set for lumpfish and the strandings were attributed to an early lumpfish season.
However, lumpfish catches for 2005 were not unusual in terms of season onset, peak or total catch, when compared to 2003–2008.
Consequently, human activity was combined with environmental factors and the variation in Danish fisheries landings in a two-part statistical model to assess the correlation of these factors with both the presence of fresh strandings and the numbers of strandings on the Danish west coast.
The final statistical model indicated that naval presence is correlated with higher rates of porpoise strandings, particularly in combination with certain fisheries, although it is not correlated with the actual presence of strandings.
Although sonar usage cannot be confirmed, it is likely that ships were testing various equipment prior to the main exercise.
Thus naval activity cannot be ruled out as a possible contributing factor.

The model was used to simulate possible mechanisms of contaminant release, the effect of increased pumpage from water-supply wells, and pumping at the leading edge of the plume as a possible means of remediation.
Based on simulation of threewaste-oil lagoons, a vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0. feet per day was required to move contaminants into the bottom layer of the model at a constant leakage rate of about 98 gallons per minute.
Simulations of a disposal well in layer 3 of the model indicated an injection rate of 50 gallons per minute was necessary to spread contaminants vertically in the aquifer.
Simulated pumping from hypothetical wells at the leading edge of the plume indicated that three wells, each pumping 25 gallons per minute from model layer 3, would capture the plume of 1,4-dioxane.
Values of pH generally were near neutral to slightly alkaline throughout most of the study area with the exception of the upper Animas River Basin near Silverton where acidic conditions existed at some sites because of hydrothermal alteration and historical mining.

Over the past decade, scientific cooperation-led and facilitated by scientific organizations such as the Cuban Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and others-has steadily increased to address ever more critical issues facing both countries.
Science and global health diplomacy were key to reestablishing a trusting and productive relationship of mutual and global benefit after the USA and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in 2015.
However, recent changes in Cuba policy by the new United States administration are jeopardizing these opportunities for increased scientific cooperation, which are in the best interests of people in both countries.
All four solar radiometers retrieve CWV by measuring total solar transmittance in the 0.94-gm water vapor absorption band and subtracting contributions due to Rayleigh, ozone and aerosol transmittances.
In a first round of comparison no attempt was made to standardize on the same radiative transfer model and its underlying water vapor spectroscopy.
In the second round of comparison we used the same line-by-line code to retrieve CAN from all four suntracking radiometers.
The spread of 8% in the solar radiometer results found when using the same model is an indication of the other-than-model uncertainties involved in determining CWV from solar transmittance measurements with current instrumentation.

PubMed Rabbani, D; Miranzadeh, M B; Motlagh, A Ahmadi 2008-01-01 This research was carried out in Kashan Fajre Sepahan Galvanizing mills for evaluation of water corrosivity during 2005-2006.
This research showed that in raw water LI were positive as well as RI and PI were lower than 7 which means that mentioned water is not corrosive.
Also LI in treated water by reverse osmosis process was negative and RI and PI were higher than 7, so, this water has corrosive properties.
Finally, calculated indexes indicate that according to LI, conditioned water is not corrosive but based on RI and P this water tend to corrosivity which this findings is compatible with literature review statement.
So it is recommended that, for water conditioning addition of preservative chemicals to be continued but at the same time another alternatives such as pH adjustment, air stripping and deoxygenating, control of carbonate concentration and split flow treatment should be studied.
The Verde Valley is a portion of central Arizona wherein concerns have been raised about water availability, particularly perennial base flow of the Verde River.
The Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater Flow Model was used to generate the water budgets and was run in several configurations for the 1910–2005 and 2005–2110 time periods.
The resultant water budgets were subtracted from one another in order to quantify the relative changes that were attributable solely to human stresses; human stresses included groundwater withdrawals and incidental and artificial recharge but did not include, for example, human effects on the global climate.
Three hypothetical and varied conditions of human stresses were developed and applied to the model for the 2005–2110 period.
On the basis of this analysis, human stresses during 1910–2005 were found to have already affected the hydrologic system of the Verde Valley, and human stresses will continue to affect the hydrologic system during 2005–2110.
Riparian evapotranspiration decreased and underflow into the Verde Valley increased because of human stresses, and net groundwater discharge to the Verde River in the Verde Valley decreased for the 1910–2005 model runs.
The model also showed that base flow at the upstream end of the study area, as of 2005, was about 4,900 acre-feet per year less than it would have been in the absence of human stresses.
At the downstream end of the Verde Valley, base flow had been reduced by about 10,000 acre-feet per year by the year 2005 because of human stresses.
The middle confining unit and the Lower Floridan aquifer in west-central Florida generally contain highly mineralized water.
The water-bearing units containing freshwater are herein referred to as the Upper Floridan aquifer.
This map report shows the potentiometric surface of the Upper Floridan aquifer measured in May 2005.
This map represents water-level conditions near the end of the dry season, when ground-water levels usually are at an annual low and withdrawals for agricultural use typically are high.
The above average precipitation is attributed to the active hurrican season for Florida in 2004.
This report, prepared by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the SWFWMD, is part of a semiannual series of Upper Floridan aquifer potentiometric-surface map reports for west-central Florida.
Potentiometric-surface maps have been prepared for January 1964, May 1969, May 1971, May 1973, May 1974, and for each May and September since 1975.
ERIC Educational Resources Information Center Tegnell, Geoffrey; Ladenburg, Thomas This unit for United States history courses examines a number of questions raised by U.S.-Cuban relations beginning with the Spanish-American War of 1898 and ending with the missile crisis 64 years later.

Two-structure thermodynamics for the TIP4P/2005 model of water covering supercooled and deeply stretched regions.
PubMed Biddle, John W; Singh, Rakesh S; Sparano, Evan M; Ricci, Francesco; González, Miguel A; Valeriani, Chantal; Abascal, José L F; Debenedetti, Pablo G; Anisimov, Mikhail A; Caupin, Frédéric 2017-01-21 One of the most promising frameworks for understanding the anomalies of cold and supercooled water postulates the existence of two competing, interconvertible local structures.
If the non-ideality in the Gibbs energy of mixing overcomes the ideal entropy of mixing of these two structures, a liquid-liquid phase transition, terminated at a liquid-liquid critical point, is predicted.
Various versions of the ""two-structure equation of state"" based on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data for metastable, deeply supercooled water and simulations of molecular water models.
However, existing TSEOSs were not designed to describe the negative pressure region and do not account for the stability limit of the liquid state with respect to the vapor.
While experimental data on supercooled water at negative pressures may shed additional light on the source of the anomalies of water, such data are very limited.
To fill this gap, we have analyzed simulation results for TIP4P/2005, one of the most accurate classical water models available.
We have used recently published simulation data, and performed additional simulations, over a broad range of positive and negative pressures, from ambient temperature to deeply supercooled conditions.
We show that, by explicitly incorporating the liquid-vapor spinodal into a TSEOS, we are able to match the simulation data for TIP4P/2005 with remarkable accuracy.
In particular, this equation of state quantitatively reproduces the lines of extrema in density, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity.
Contrary to an explanation of the thermodynamic anomalies of water based on a ""retracing spinodal,"" the liquid-vapor spinodal in the present TSEOS continues monotonically to lower pressures upon cooling, influencing but not giving rise to density extrema and other thermodynamic anomalies.
The results of this assessment were used to determine the current water-quality conditions in this subregion of the High Plains aquifer and to relate ground-water quality to natural and human factors affecting water quality.
Water-quality analyses indicated that water samples rarely exceeded established United States Environmental Protection Agency public drinking-water standards for those constituents sampled; 13 of the constituents measured or analyzed exceeded their respective standards in at least one sample.
Nitrate, uranium, iron, and manganese concentrations were larger than drinking-water standards in 6 percent of the samples.
Wells sampled in the Platte River Valley and Eastern Nebraska units exceeded water-quality standards more often than the Ogallala Formation and Sand Hills units.
These system state variables include the distribution of heads within an aquifer, streamflow rates within a hydraulically connected stream, and flow rates into or out of aquifer storage.
The new package provides a means to explicitly represent heads, streamflows, and changes in aquifer storage as state variables in a GWM-2005 simulation.
The availability of these state variables makes it possible to include system state in the objective function and enhances existing capabilities for constructing constraint sets for a groundwater-management formulation.
The new package can be used to address groundwater-management problems such as the determination of withdrawal strategies that meet water-supply demands while simultaneously maximizing heads or streamflows, or minimizing changes in aquifer storage.
Four sample problems are provided to demonstrate use of the new package for typical groundwater-management applications.
Assessing bottled water nitrate concentrations to evaluate total drinking water nitrate exposure and risk of birth defects.
PubMed Weyer, Peter J; Brender, Jean D; Romitti, Paul A; Kantamneni, Jiji R; Crawford, David; Sharkey, Joseph R; Shinde, Mayura; Horel, Scott A; Vuong, Ann M; Langlois, Peter H 2014-12-01 Previous epidemiologic studies of maternal exposure to drinking water nitrate did not account for bottled water consumption.
The objective of this National Birth Defects Prevention Study analysis was to assess the impact of bottled water use on the relation between maternal exposure to drinking water nitrate and selected birth defects in infants born during 1997-2005.
Median bottled water nitrate concentrations were assigned by community; mothers' overall intake of nitrate in mg/day from drinking water was calculated.
Odds ratios for neural tube defects, limb deficiencies, oral cleft defects, and heart defects were estimated using mixed-effects models for logistic regression.
PubMed Lambe, Jennifer Lynn 2017-01-01 This article traces the battle over Freud within Cuban psychiatry from its pre-1959 origins through the ""disappearance"" of Freud by the early 1970s.
It devotes particular attention to the visit of two Soviet psychiatrists to Cuba in the early 1960s as part of a broader campaign to promote Pavlov.
The decade-long controversy over Freud responded to both theoretical and political concerns.
If for some Freud represented political conservatism and theoretical mystification, Pavlov held out the promise of a dialectical materialist future.
Meanwhile, other psychiatrists clung to psychodynamic perspectives, or at least the possibility of heterogeneity.
The Freudians would end up on the losing side of this battle, with many departing Cuba over the course of the 1960s.
But banishing Freud did not necessarily make for stalwart Pavlovians-or vanguard revolutionaries.
Psychiatry would find itself relegated to a handmaiden position in the work of revolutionary mental engineering, with the government itself occupying the vanguard.
The lake is the primary drinking-water supply for the City of Shreveport, Louisiana.
In addition, the land use of the watershed contributing runoff to Cross Lake has changed.
Changes in land use and urbanization could affect the water chemistry and biology of the Lake.
Water-quality data were collected at 10 sites on Cross Lake from February 1997 to February 1999.
These samples included physical and chemical-related properties such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance; selected major inorganic ions; nutrients; minor elements; organic chemical constituents; and bacteria.
Suspended-sediment samples were collected seven times during the sampling period.
The bottom-material samples, which were collected once during the sampling period, were analyzed for selected minor elements and inorganic carbon.
Aside from the nutrient-enriched condition of Cross Lake, the overall water-quality of Cross Lake is good.
No primary Federal or State water-quality criteria were exceeded by any of the water-quality constituents analyzed for this report.
Concentrations of major inorganic constituents, except iron and manganese, were low.
Minor elements and organic compounds were present in low concentrations, many below detection limits.
Nitrogen and phosphorus were the nutrients occurring in the highest concentrations.
Nutrients were evenly distributed across the lake with no particular water-quality site indicating consistently higher or lower nutrient concentrations.
More than half of fresh groundwater withdrawals in the United States in 2005 occurred in six States.
In California, Texas, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Idaho, most of the fresh groundwater withdrawals were for irrigation.
In Florida, 52 percent of all fresh groundwater withdrawals were for public supply, and 34 percent were for irrigation.
Monitoring activities include continuous and periodic measurements of ground-water pumpage from the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer, ground-water levels in the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer, surface-water discharge, flowmeter tests, and ground-water and surface-water chemistry.
In 1998, ground-water withdrawals for industrial and municipal use totaled about 7,060 acre-feet, which is less than a 1 percent decrease from 1997.
Pumpage from the confined part of the aquifer decreased by less than 1 percent to 5,470 acre-feet, and pumpage from the unconfined part of the aquifer increased by less than 1 percent to 1,590 acre-feet.
Water-level declines in the confined part of the aquifer were recorded in 10 of 14 wells during 1998, and the median change from 1997 was a decline of 3. feet as opposed to a rise of 0. feet for the change from 1996 to 1997.
Water-level declines in the unconfined part of the aquifer were recorded in 9 of 16 wells, and the median change from 1997 was 0. feet, which is the same as the median change from 1996 to 1997.
Of the 35 pumpage meters on municipal wells that were tested, the difference between metered and tested discharge ranged from +6. to -19. percent.
Five of the meters exceeded the allowable difference and should be repaired or replaced.
The low-flow discharge ranged from 0.41 to 5. cubic feet Sex and sentiment in Cuban tourism.

Here I present work I conducted in Cuba that was guided, like my work in Peru, Nicaragua, and southern Mexico by the writings of Safa and others who saw the critical need to bring gender into meaningful discussion in the field of Latin American and Caribbean studies.
In what follows, drawn from my broader research on tourism in four nations, I explore and reflect on the contemporary dynamics of sex and romance tourism in Cuba.
I suggest that the allure of this domain of tourism may be enhanced by Cuba's global political identity, and that Cuban women participating in commodified and intimate exchanges reveal an ability to get along in a market economy that generally excludes them.
Radical-scavenging activity, protective effect against lipid peroxidation and mineral contents of monofloral Cuban honeys.
PubMed Alvarez-Suarez, José M; Giampieri, Francesca; Damiani, Elisabetta; Astolfi, Paola; Fattorini, Daniele; Regoli, Francesco; Quiles, José L; Battino, Maurizio 2012-03-01 Several monofloral Cuban honeys were analyzed to determine their free radical-scavenging activity and from this the total antioxidant content was estimated.
The protective effect against lipid peroxidation in an in vitro model of rat liver homogenates was evaluated and, lastly, the mineral content of the honeys, which can be related to the maintenance of intracellular oxidative balance, was determined.
The scavenging capacities against hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were determined using the spin-trapping technique and the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assay, respectively.
Lipid peroxidation was evaluated through the production of TBARS and hydroperoxides.
All honeys tested showed potential antioxidant activity with Linen vine displaying the highest scavenging capacity towards the DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, while the least efficient was Christmas vine honey.
Honeys also inhibited, in a concentration-dependent mode, lipid peroxidation in rat liver homogenates, with Linen vine resulting the best while the least effective was Christmas vine honey.
The ability to scavenge free radicals and protect against lipid peroxidation may contribute to the ability of certain Cuban honeys to help in preventing/reducing some inflammatory diseases in which oxidative stress is involved.
Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, an ongoing multisite population-based case–control study, the association between selected non-genetic factors and non-syndromic AVSDs was examined.
Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from logistic regression models.
The association was strongest in mothers who smoked more than 25 cigarettes/day.
No associations were observed between AVSDs and maternal history of a urinary tract infection or pelvic inflammatory disease, maternal use of a wide variety of medications, maternal occupational exposure, parental drug use, or maternal alcohol consumption.
If the results of this preliminary study can be replicated, minimizing maternal active and passive smoke exposure may decrease the incidence of AVSDs.

This surveillance system is the primary source of data concerning the scope and effects of waterborne disease in the United States.
Data presented summarize 28 WBDOs that occurred during January 2005--December 2006 and four previously unreported WBDOs that occurred during 1979--2002.
The surveillance system includes data on WBDOs associated with recreational water, drinking water, water not intended for drinking , and water use of unknown intent.
Public health departments in the states, territories, localities, and Freely Associated States are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC by a standard form.

More specifically, in subjects having a hypothetical 'atopic genotype', HT could boost preexistent allergy symptoms.
We tested the latter hypothesis in Cuba, a country where both asthma and HT are prevalent.
In a group of Cuban school-aged children , we investigated the association of Toxocara seropositivity and atopic status with asthma.
Toxocara seropositivity was diagnosed with ELISA and atopy by allergen skin prick test.
Both physician-diagnosed asthma and current wheeze, as determined by International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, were considered.
Associations were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses, with either 'physician-diagnosed asthma' or 'current wheeze' as outcome variable..1% of the children were Toxocara seropositive.
Prevalences were 21.7% for current wheeze and 32.7% for physician-diagnosed asthma.
Our data confirm previous observations of higher Toxocara seropositivity rates in asthmatic children.
Toxocara seropositivity appeared to abrogate the apparent association between atopy and asthma in Cuban children.
Although this observation was limited to physician-diagnosed asthma, it challenges the hypothesis that HT stimulates the onset of allergic diseases such as asthma in atopic individuals.
PubMed Estrada-MartÃ­nez, Lorena M; Padilla, Mark B; Caldwell, Cleopatra Howard; Schulz, Amy Jo 2011-08-01 Existing research rarely considers important ethnic subgroup variations in violent behaviors among Latino youth.
Thus, their risk for severe violent behaviors is not well understood in light of the immense ethnic and generational diversity of the Latino population in the United States.
Grounded in social control theory and cultural analyses of familism, we examine differences in the risk for severe youth violence, as well its associations with family cohesion, parental engagement, adolescent autonomy, household composition, and immigrant generation among Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , and non-Latino Black , and White adolescents with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.
Results indicate a gradient of risk; White youth had the lowest risk for severe violence and Puerto Rican youth had the highest risk compared to all other racial/ethnic subgroups.
Within-group analysis indicates that family factors are not universally protective or risk-inducing.
While family cohesion decreased the risk of severe violence among all groups, parental engagement was associated with increased risk among Blacks and Whites, and adolescent autonomy was associated with increased risk among Puerto Ricans and Cubans.
In addition, Cuban and White adolescents who lived in single parent households or who did not live with their parents, had higher risk for severe violent behaviors than their counterparts who lived in two parent households.
Among Latinos, the association of immigrant generation was in opposite directions among Mexicans and Cubans.
We conclude that family and immigration factors differentially influence risk for violence among Latino subgroups and highlight the significance of examining subgroup differences and developing intervention strategies that are tailored to the needs of each ethnic subgroup.
A pilot study was conducted during 2005 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Chester County Health Department and the Chester County Water Resources Authority to determine if wastewater components, including inorganic constituents and selected organic wastewater compounds, such as detergents, considered to be emerging contaminants, were present in ground water and stream base flow in areas with on-site wastewater disposal.
The study area was a small watershed of mixed land use drained by Broad Run in central Chester County, Pa.
The area is underlain by fractured metamorphic rocks that form aquifers recharged by precipitation.
Surfaceand ground-water sampling was done in areas with and without on-site wastewater disposal for comparison, including a relatively densely populated village with cesspools and septic systems, a residential area with septic systems, a residential area served by sewers, and agricultural land.
Samples were collected in May-June and September 2005 from eight headwater stream sites under base-flow conditions and in June 2005 from eight wells and two springs.
Samples were analyzed for major ions, nutrients, boron, bacteria, and a suite of organic wastewater compounds.
Several emerging contaminant wastewater compounds, including detergent components, insect repellents, and flame retardants, were detected in base-flow and ground-water samples.
Stream base-flow samples generally contained more compounds and higher concentrations of those compounds than did ground-water samples, and of the ground-water samples, samples from springs contained more compounds and higher concentrations than samples from wells.

Scant information exists on the extent of the decline, as this bay was not investigated for water quality concerns before the die-offs and limited areas were sampled after the primary die-off.
We use imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to examine water clarity in Florida Bay for the period 1985 to 1997.
The AVHRR provides data on nominal water reflectance and estimated fight attenuation, which are used here to describe turbidity conditions in the bay on a seasonal basis.
In situ observations on changes in seagrass abundance within the bay, combined with the satellite data, provide additional insights into losses of seagrass.
The imagery shows an extensive region to the west of Florida Bay having increased reflectance and fight attenuation in both winter and summer beginning in winter of 1988.
These increases are consistent with a change from dense seagrass to sparse or negligible cover.
The decline in water clarity has continued in the northwestern bay since 1991.
The area west of the Everglades National Park boundaries has shown decreases in both winter turbidity and summer reflectances, suggestive of partial seagrass recovery.
Water samples were collected during base-flow conditions and storms in the subbasins of the Cambridge Reservoir and Stony Brook Reservoir drainage areas and analyzed for dissolved calcium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate; total nitrogen and phosphorus; and polar pesticides and metabolites.
These data were collected to assist watershed administrators in managing the drinking-water source area and to identify potential sources of contaminants and trends in contaminant loading to the water supply.
Monthly reservoir contents for the Cambridge Reservoir varied from about 59 to 98 percent of capacity during water year 2006, while monthly reservoir contents for the Stony Brook Reservoir and the Fresh Pond Reservoir was maintained at greater than 83 and 94 percent of capacity, respectively.
The monthly mean specific-conductance values for all continuously monitored stations within the drinking-water source area were generally within the range of historical data collected since water year 1997, and in many cases were less than the historical medians.

Four wells were drilled north of the property adjacent to Area A, three wells along strike located on Lewis Drive, and three wells directly down dip on Ivyland Road.
Borehole television surveys were obtained at the four monitor wells adjacent to Area A.Caliper and borehole television surveys were used to locate fractures, inflections on fluidtemperature and fluid-resistivity logs were used to locate possible water-bearing fractures, and heatpulseflowmeter measurements verified these locations.
After interpretation of geophysical logs, borehole television surveys, and driller's logs, all wells were screened such that water-level fluctuations could be monitored and water samples collected from discrete water-bearing zones in each borehole.
The purpose of the study was to assess the shallow ground-water quality and to determine whether any effects on water quality could be related to human activities and particularly rice agriculture.
The wells installed and sampled were between 8. and 15. meters deep, and water levels were between 0. and 8. meters below land surface.
Ground-water samples were analyzed for 6 field measurements, 29 inorganic constituents, 6 nutrient constituents, dissolved organic carbon, 86 pesticides, tritium , deuterium , and oxygen-18.
At least one health-related state or federal drinking-water standard was exceeded in 25 percent of the wells for barium, boron, cadmium, molybdenum, or sulfate.
At least one state or federal secondary maximum contaminant level was exceeded in 79 percent of the wells for chloride, iron, manganese, specific conductance, or dissolved solids.
Nitrate and nitrite were detected at concentrations below state and federal 2000 drinking-water standards; three wells had nitrate concentrations greater than 3 milligrams per liter, a level that may indicate impact from human activities.
Eleven pesticides and one pesticide degradation product were detected in ground-water samples.
Pesticides were detected in 89 percent of the wells sampled, and rice pesticides were detected in 82 percent of the wells sampled.
The investigation included a review of all water resources but centered on the Newark basin aquifer, a fractured-bedrock aquifer over which nearly 300,000 people reside.
Most concern has been focused on this aquifer because of high summer pumping rates, with occasional entrained-air problems and an unexplained water-level decline at a monitoring well, annual withdrawals that have approached or even exceeded previous estimates of aquifer recharge, and numerous contamination problems that have caused temporary or long-term shutdown of production wells.
Water withdrawals from the alluvial aquifer in the Ramapo River valley and the Lake DeForest Reservoir are subject to water-supply application permits that stipulate minimum flows that must be maintained downstream into New Jersey.
There is a need, therefore, at a minimum, to prevent any loss of the bedrock-aquifer resource--to maintain it in terms of both sustainable use and water-quality protection.
The framework of the Newark basin bedrock aquifer included characterization of the structure and fracture occurrence associated with the Newark basin strata, the texture and thickness of overlying glacial and alluvial deposits, the presence of the Palisades sill and associated basaltic units on or within the Newark basin strata, and the streams that drain the aquifer system.
Information about amounts of water withdrawn, sources of wa ter, how the water was used, and how much water was returned is available to those involved in establishing water-resource policy and to those managing water resources.
In 1978, the USGS entered into a cooperative program with the Wisconsin De partment of Natural Resources to inventory water use in Wisconsin.

At the end of the winters of 1997 and 1998, a 50-m mixed layer was detected, with higher average temperatures of 2.3Â°C in winter 1998.
The increase of temperature observed in the study area during the periods affected by El NiÃ±o 1997-1998 resulted in a sinking of the thermocline and isotherms, showing the strongest effect of this warming in the surface layer to 70 m during summer 1997.
In this work, heterometallic manganeseâoxido cubane clusters structurally relevant to the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II were prepared and characterized.
The reduction potentials of these clusters and other related mixed metal manganeseâtetraoxido complexes are correlated with the Lewis acidity of the apical redox-inactive metal in a manner similar to a related series of heterometallic manganeseâdioxido clusters.
The redox potentials of the and clusters are close, which is consistent with the observation that the OEC is functional only with one of these two metals.
Considering our previous studies of moieties, the present results with more structurally accurate models of the OEC suggest a general relationship between the reduction potentials of heterometallic oxido clusters and the Lewis acidities of incorporated cations that applies to diverse structural motifs.
These findings support proposals that one function of calcium in the OEC is to modulate the reduction potential of the cluster to allow electron transfer.
A draft Total Maximum Daily Load was proposed for various parameters and is expected to be adopted in full in 2006.
Diamond Lake has supported potentially toxic blue-green algae blooms since 2001 that have resulted in closures to recreational water contact and impacts to the local economy.
Increased populations of the invasive tui chub fish are reportedly responsible, because they feed on zooplankton that would otherwise control the algal blooms.
The Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Diamond Lake Restoration Project advocates reduced fish biomass in Diamond Lake in 2006 as the preferred alternative.
A restoration project scheduled to reduce fish biomass for the lake includes a significant water-level drawdown that began in January 2006.
After the drawdown of Diamond Lake, the fish toxicant rotenone was applied to eradicate the tui chub.
Winter exports of nutrients from Diamond Lake during the restoration project could affect the summer trophic status of the North Umpqua River if retention and recycling in Lemolo Lake are significant.
The FEIS includes comprehensive monitoring to assess the water quality of the restored Diamond Lake and the effects of that restoration downstream.
One component of the monitoring is the collection of baseline data, in order to observe changes in the river's water quality and algal conditions resulting from the restoration of Diamond Lake.
Forty-four United States Geological Survey sites were examined for trends in pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen, and in concentrations of dissolved solids, suspended sediment, chloride, sodium, sulfate, silica, potassium, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, total ammonia, total ammonia plus organic nitrogen, dissolved nitrite plus nitrate, and total phosphorus.
The seasonal Kendall test or Tobit regression was used to detect trends.
Concentrations of dissolved constituents have increased in the Southeast during the last 30 years.
Specific conductance increased at 62 percent and decreased at 3 percent of the sites, and pH increased at 31 percent and decreased at 11 percent of the sites.
Decreasing trends in total nitrogen were detected at 49 percent of the sites, and increasing trends were detected at 10 percent of the sites.
Ammonia concentrations decreased at 27 percent of the sites and increased at 6 percent of the sites.
Nitrite plus nitrate concentrations increased at 29 percent of the sites and decreased at 10 percent of the sites.
These results indicate that the changes in stream nitrogen concentrations generally coincided with improved municipal wastewater-treatment methods.
Long-term decreasing trends in total phosphorus were detected at 56 percent of the sites, and increasing trends were detected at 8 percent of the sites.
Concentrations of phosphorus have decreased over the last 35 years, which coincided with phosphate-detergent bans and improvements in wastewater treatment that were implemented beginning in 1972.
Nutrient concentrations were generally low, rarely exceeding concentrations found in agricultural streams or water-quality criteria.
Seventeen pesticides and five pesticide metabolites were detected, with atrazine being the only pesticide detected at all 13 streams.
Instream fish habitat was sparse with little woody debris and few boulders, cobble, or other suitable fish habitat.
Fish communities were characterized by high percentages of omnivores and tolerant species with few intolerant species.
Index of Biotic Integrity scores were low, with most streams rating fair to very poor.
Percent impervious surface was positively correlated with sodium and chloride concentrations and human population density, but was negatively correlated with fish species richness and diversity.
Urban land use and human population density influence fish communities and water quality in Twin Cities metropolitan area streams.
Other factors that may influence fish community composition include percent impervious cover, water chemistry, water temperature, geomorphology, substrate, instream habitat, and migration barriers.
As shown in CMIP5, different ESMs usually use different LSMs and represent various land surface status.
All of three models were driven by CRUNCEP data and simulation results from 1980 to 2010 were used in this study.
Diagnostic data provided by NCAR, global latent and sensible heat flux map estimated by Jung, net radiation from SRB, and in situ observation collected from FluxNet were used as reference data.
Two variables, surface runoff and snow depth, were used for evaluating the model performance in water budget simulation, while three variables including net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat were used for assessing energy budget simulation.
For 30 years averaged runoff, global average value of Colm2014 is 0.44mm/day and close to the diagnostic value of 0.75 mm/day, while that of Colm2005 is 0.44mm/day and that of CLM is 0.20mm/day.
For snow depth simulation, three models all have overestimation in the Northern Hemisphere and underestimation in the Southern Hemisphere compare to diagnostic data.
In addition it has been available as many recreational usages especially in the warm months.
As a result of being located near one of the crowded cities of the world, a variety of microbial pollutions is commonly perceived in the Jajrood River.
Among them, there are strong concerns about fecal coliform bacteria concentration.
This article aimed to model fate and transport of fecal coliform bacteria in Jajrood River watershed using Soil and Water Assessment Tool model version 2005.
Potential pollutant sources in the study area were detected and quantified for modeling purposes.
In spite of being lack of knowledge about bacteria die-off rate in small river bodies, as well as in other watershed-based forms, fecal coliform bacteria die-off rates were estimated using both laboratory and field data investigations with some simplifications.
The SWAT model was calibrated over an extended time period for this watershed.
This research illustrates SWAT 2005 capability to model fecal coliform bacteria in a populated watershed, and deals with most of watershed microbial pollution sources that are usually observed in developing countries.
Fecal coliform concentration simulation results were mostly in the same order in comparison with real data.
In this article different aspects of SWAT capabilities for modeling of fecal coliform bacteria concentration will be reviewed and it will present new insights in bacteria modeling procedures especially for mountainous, high populated and small sized watersheds.
Changes in agricultural practices and land use in the Salinas alluvial fan have also caused changes in the geographic distribution of ground-water withdrawals from the alluvial aquifer.
As a result, the ground-water balance and ground-water flow pattern have changed throughout the years and may explain the presence of saline ground water along parts of the coast at present.
By providing a reconstruction of historical ground-water development in the Salinas alluvial fan area, from the initial years of aquifer development at about 1900 to the most recent conditions existing in 2005, water resources managers and planners can use the results of the analysis for a more complete understanding of aquifer conditions especially pertaining to water quality.
This study effort was conducted by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources as a contribution in the management of the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.
The study area is bounded to the north by foothills of the Cordillera Central mountain chain, to the south by the Caribbean Sea, and to the east and west by the Rio Nigua de Salinas and the Quebrada Aguas Verdes, respectively.
Fan-delta and alluvial deposits contain the principal aquifers in the study area.

GWM can solve a broad range of groundwater-management problems by combined use of simulationand optimization-modeling techniques.
These problems include limiting groundwater-level declines or streamflow depletions, managing groundwater withdrawals, and conjunctively using groundwater and surface-water resources.
Several modifications and enhancements have been made to GWM since its initial release to increase the scope of the program's capabilities and to improve its operation and reporting of results.
The new code, which is called GWM-2005, also was designed to support the local grid refinement capability of MODFLOW-2005.
Local grid refinement allows for the simulation of one or more higher resolution local grids within a coarser grid parent model.
Local grid refinement is often needed to improve simulation accuracy in regions where hydraulic gradients change substantially over short distances or in areas requiring detailed representation of aquifer heterogeneity.
GWM-2005 can be used to formulate and solve groundwater-management problems that include components in both parent and child models.
Although local grid refinement increases simulation accuracy, it can also substantially increase simulation run times.
We have undertaken to explore this specific assemblage of literature with the intention of identifying commonly reported procedures in terms of data integration methods, modelling techniques, approaches to stakeholder participation, means of communication of model results, and other elements of the model development and application life cycle.
Initial results from this effort will be presented including a summary of commonly used practices, and their evolution over the past two decades.
We anticipate that results will show a pattern of movement toward greater use of both stakeholder/participatory modelling methods as well as increased use of automated methods for data integration and model preparation.
Interestingly, such results could be interpreted to show that the availability of better, faster, and more integrated software tools and technologies free the modeler to take a less technocratic and more human approach to water resources modelling.
Structural and magnetic characterization of a tetranuclear copper cubane stabilized by intramolecular metal cation-Ï interactions.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that complex 1 consists of a Cu44 cubane core, where the four copper centers are linked by Î¼3-hydroxo bridges.
X-ray analysis also evidenced an unusual metal cation-Ï interaction between the copper ions and phenyl substituents of the ligand.
Calculations based on the density functional theory method were used to quantify the strength of this metal-Ï interaction, which appears as an important stabilizing parameter of the cubane core, possibly acting as a driving parameter in the self-aggregation process.
The magnetic properties of complexes 1 and 2 are reported and discussed.
These data, accumulated during many water years, constitute a valuable data base for developing an improved understanding of the water resources of the State.
This series of annual reports for Maryland and Delaware began with the 1961 water year with a report that contained only data relating to the quantities of surface water.
For the 1964 water year, a similar report was introduced that contained only data relating to water quality.
Beginning with the l975 water year, the report format was changed to present, in one volume, data on quantities of surface water, quality of surface and ground water, and ground-water levels.
Both volumes contained data on quantities of surface water, quality of surface and ground water, and ground-water levels.
Volume 1 contained data on the Atlantic Slope Basins and Volume 2 contained data on the Monongahela and Potomac River basins.
Beginning with the 1991 water year, Volume 1 contains all information on quantities of surface water and surfacewater-quality data and Volume 2 contains ground-water levels and ground-water-quality data.
This report is Volume 2 in our 1998 series and includes records of water levels and water quality of ground-water wells and springs.
Ground-water flow is simulated using a block-centered finite-difference approach.
Flow associated with external stresses, such as wells, areal recharge, evapotranspiration, drains, and rivers, also can be simulated.
The report includes detailed explanations of physical and mathematical concepts on which the model is based, an explanation of how those concepts are incorporated in the modular structure of the computer program, instructions for using the model, and details of the computer code.
The modular structure consists of a MAIN Program and a series of highly independent subroutines.
Each package deals with a specific feature of the hydrologic system that is to be simulated, such as flow from rivers or flow into drains, or with a specific method of solving the set of simultaneous equations resulting from the finite-difference method.
Several solution methods are incorporated, including the Preconditioned Conjugate-Gradient method.
The division of the program into packages permits the user to examine specific hydrologic features of the model independently.
This also facilitates development of additional capabilities because new packages can be added to the program without modifying the existing packages.
The input and output systems of the computer program also are designed to permit maximum flexibility.
The program is designed to allow other capabilities, such as transport and optimization, to be incorporated, but this report is limited to describing the ground-water flow capability.
The program is written in Fortran 90 and will run without modification on most computers that have a Fortran 90 compiler.
The data were obtained to characterize the nucleus prior to the Deep Impact 2005 encounter, and to enable us to understand the rotation state in order to make a time of arrival adjustment in February 2010 that would allow us to image at least 25% of the nucleus seen by the Deep Impact spacecraft to better than 80 m/pixel, and to image the crater made during the encounter, if possible.

Maximum positive discharge from Barron River and Faka Union River was 6,000 and 3,200 ft3/s, respectively; no other tributary exceeded 2,600 ft3/s.
Salinity variation was greatest at Barron River and Faka Union River, ranging from 2 to 37 ppt, and from 3 to 34 ppt, respectively.
Salinity maximums were greatest at Wood River and Little Wood River, each exceeding 40 ppt.
All data were collected prior to the commencement of the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, which is designed to establish a more natural flow regime to the tributaries of the Ten Thousand Islands area.

All members of the 3d-block 8family have spin ground states, ST, of zero, with the higher ST levels just a few reciprocal centimeters away in energy.
Fifty-two organic compounds were commonly detected in source water and finished water.
The diversity of compounds detected suggests a variety of sources and uses, including wastewater discharges, industrial, agricultural, domestic, and others.
A human-health benchmark is a chemical concentration specific to water above which there is a risk to humans, however, benchmarks were available for only 18 of the 42 compounds with detected concentrations greater than 0. micrograms per liter.
On the basis of this assessment, adverse effects to human health are assumed to be negligible.
The seasonal forcing over Saturnâs 30 years period influences the production/loss of the major atmospheric absorbers and coolants through photochemistry, and influences therefore Saturnâs stratospheric temperatures.
We have developed a 2D time-dependent photochemical model of Saturnâs atmosphere , coupled to a radiative-climate model to study seasonal effects on its atmospheric composition.
Differences between the observed distribution of hydrocarbons and 2D-photochemical predictions are likely to be an indicator of dynamical forcing.Disentangling the origin of water in the stratosphere of this planet has been a long-term issue.
Due to Saturnâs cold tropopause trap, which acts as a transport barrier, the water vapor observed by the Infrared Space Observatory has an external origin.
Previous observations of Saturn with Herschelâs Hsso program led to the detection of a water torus around Saturn , fed by Enceladusâ geysers.
Reports in this series, published cooperatively by the United States Geological Survey and the Utah Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water Resources, provide data to enable interested parties to keep aware of changing ground-water conditions.This report, like the others in the series, contains information on well construction, ground-water withdrawal from wells, water-level changes, precipitation, streamflow, and chemical quality of water.
Supplementary data are included in reports of this series only for those years or areas for which applicable data are available and are important to a discussion of changing ground-water conditions.This report includes individual discussions of selected significant areas of ground-water development in the State for calendar year 1996.
Most of the reported data were collected by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Utah Department of Natural Resources, Divisions of Water Rights and Water Resources.
For generations, tribal members of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community have hunted and fished in the watershed.
Tribal government and members of Keweenaw Bay Indian Community are concerned about the effect of any development within the watershed, which is rural, isolated, and lightly populated.
Since 2004, several mineral-exploration firms have been actively investigating areas within the watershed; property acquisition, road construction, and subsurface drilling have taken place close to tributary streams of the Silver River.
The United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, conducted a multi-year water-resources investigation of the Silver River Watershed during 2005-08.
Methods of investigation included analyses of streamflow, water-quality sampling, and ecology at eight discrete sites located throughout the watershed.
In addition, three continuous-record streamgages located within the watershed provided stage, discharge, specific conductance, and water-temperature data on an hourly basis.
Water quality of the Silver River Watershed is typical of many streams in undeveloped areas of Upper Michigan.
Concentrations of most analytes typically were low, although several exceeded applicable surface-water-quality standards.
Seven samples had concentrations of copper that exceeded the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality standards for wildlife, and one sample had concentrations of cyanide that exceeded the same standards.
Concentrations of total mercury at all eight sampling sites exceeded the Great Lakes Basin water-quality standard, but the ratio of methylmercury to total mercury was similar to the 5 to 10 percent found in most natural waters.
Concentrations of arsenic and chromium in bed sediments were near the threshold-effect concentration.
Data collected by the United States Geological Survey and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality, from April 2005 through September 2008 are presented in this report.
Data presented include well-construction characteristics and periodic groundwater-level measurements for 29 wells, borehole geophysical logs for 8 wells, hourly groundwater-level measurements for 5 wells, continuous water-quality measurements for 3 wells, periodic water-quality samples for 12 wells and 1 surface-water station, slug-test results for 11 wells, and shallow groundwater-flow maps.
The results show that ground water used for drinking water is generally of good quality in the Genesee River Basin, although concentrations of seven constituents exceeded drinking water standards.
The cations that were detected in the highest concentrations were calcium, magnesium, and sodium; the anions that were detected in the greatest concentrations were bicarbonate, chloride, and sulfate.
The predominant nutrient was nitrate, and nitrate concentrations were greater in samples from sand and gravel aquifers than in samples from bedrock aquifers.
The trace elements barium, boron, cobalt, copper, and nickel were detected in every sample; the highest concentrations were barium, boron, chromium, iron, manganese, strontium, and lithium.
Eight volatile organic compounds were detected in six samples, but none of the concentrations exceeded MCLs.
United States SciTech Connect Smith, C A; Belles, R D; Simon, A J 2011-03-16 Flow charts depicting water use in the United States have been constructed from publicly available data and estimates of water use patterns.
Approximately 410,500 million gallons per day of water are managed throughout the United States for use in farming, power production, residential, commercial, and industrial applications.
Water that is not consumed or evaporated during its use is returned to surface bodies of water.
These types of wells can be represented in numerical simulations of groundwater flow by use of the Multi-Node Well Packages developed for the United States Geological Surveyâs MODFLOW model.
However, previous versions of the Groundwater-Management Process for MODFLOW did not allow the use of multi-node wells in groundwater-management formulations.
This report describes modifications to the MODFLOWâ2005 version of the GWM Process to provide for such use with the MNW2 Package.
Multi-node wells can be incorporated into a management formulation as flow-rate decision variables for which optimal withdrawal or injection rates will be determined as part of the GWMâ2005 solution process.
In addition, the heads within multi-node wells can be used as head-type state variables, and, in that capacity, be included in the objective function or constraint set of a management formulation.
Simple head bounds also can be defined to constrain water levels at multi-node wells.
The report provides instructions for including multi-node wells in the GWMâ2005 data-input files and a sample problem that demonstrates use of multi-node wells in a typical groundwater-management problem.
Coincident with a public education campaign, a population survey for these species was conducted in the northern part of the Isla de la Juventud on 17 December 1995, from 06hoo to 10hoo.
Residents from throughout the island participated, manning 98 stations, with 1-4 observers per station.
Parrots were observed at 60 of the stations with a total of 1320, maximum , and 1100, minimum , individuals counted.
Some contours are inferred from previous potentiometric-surface maps with larger well networks.
The potentiometric surface of the carbonate upper Floridan aquifer responds mainly to rainfall, and more locally, to ground water withdrawals.
Potentiometric-surface highs generally correspond to topographic highs where the aquifer is recharged.
Springs and areas of diffuse upward leakage naturally discharge water from the aquifer and are most prevalent along the St.
Areas of discharge are reflected by depressions in the potentiometric surface.
Ground water withdrawals locally have lowered the potentiometric surface.
Ground water in the upper Floridan aquifer generally flows from potentiometric highs to potentiometric lows in a direction perpendicular to the contours.
The potentiometric surface of the carbonate Upper Floridan aquifer responds mainly to rainfall, and more locally, to ground-water withdrawals and springflow.
Little is known about the occurrence, fate, or transport of these compounds and the possible health effects in humans and aquatic life.
The United States Geological Survey, in cooperation with the City of Columbus, Division of Power and Water, did a study to provide a synoptic view of the occurrence of antibiotics in source and finished waters in the upper Scioto River Basin.
Of the 49 targeted antibiotic compounds, 12 were detected at least one time for a total of 61 detections overall.
These compounds were azithromycin, tylosin, erythromycin-H2O, erythromycin, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, iso-chlorotetracycline, lincomycin, and trimethoprim.
Hap Cremean WTP had the fewest detections, with two source-water detections of sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin and no detections in the finished water.
Sulfamethoxazale and azithromycin detections represent 41 percent of all antibiotic detections.
Some antibiotics, such as those in the quinoline and tetracycline families, dissipate more quickly in warm water, which may explain why they were detected in the cool months and not in the summer.
Because of ongoing development in the drinking-water source area, the Cambridge water supply has the potential to be affected by a wide variety of contaminants.
The United States Geological Survey has monitored surface-water quality in the Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook Basins, which compose the drinking-water source area, since 1997 through continuous monitoring and discrete sample collection and, since 2004, through systematic collection of streamwater samples during base-flow and stormflow conditions at five primary sampling stations in the drinking-water source area.
Four primary sampling stations are on small tributaries in the Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook Basins; the fifth primary sampling station is on the main stem of Stony Brook and drains about 93 percent of the Cambridge drinking-water source area.
Water samples also were collected at six secondary sampling stations, including Fresh Pond Reservoir, the final storage reservoir for the raw water supply.
Storm runoff and base-flow concentrations of calcium , chloride , sodium , and sulfate were estimated from continuous records of streamflow and specific conductance for six monitoring stations, which include the five primary sampling stations.
These data were used to characterize current water-quality conditions, estimate loads and yields, and describe trends in Cl and Na in the tributaries and main-stem streams in the Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook Basins.
These data also were used to describe how streamwater quality is affected by various watershed characteristics and provide information to guide future watershed management.

A better understanding is needed about water-use patterns, particularly about the amount of water used, where and how this water is used and disposed, and how human activities impact water resources.
Irrigation practices, indoor and outdoor household uses, industrial uses, and commercial and mining withdrawals affect reservoirs, streams, and aquifers.
Accurate and accessible water information for Puerto Rico is critical to ensure that water managers have the ability to protect and conserve this natural resource.
The population of Puerto Rico increased 15 percent, from 3. million in 1985 to 3. million people 2005 and resulted in an increased demand for freshwater, mostly for the public-supply water use category.
Almost 99 percent of the residents in Puerto Rico were served by public-supply water systems in 2005.
One of the major challenges that water managers confront is the need to provide sufficient freshwater availability in the densely populated areas.
Public-supply water is provided by the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority and by non-PRASA systems.
The prevalence of the organism was determined by a quantitative PCR assay targeting the P jirovecii mitochondrial large subunit rRNA gene.
Genotypes were identified by direct sequencing of mtLSU ribosomal DNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the dihydropteroate synthase gene amplicons. qPCR detected P jirovecii DNA in 48/163 samples. mtLSU rDNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of three different genotypes in the population.
Genotype 2 was most common , followed in prevalence by genotypes 1 and 3 ; mixed-genotype infections were seen in 10% of the cases.
RFLP analysis of DHPS PCR products revealed four genotypes, 18% of which were associated with resistance to sulfa drugs.
Only contact with coughers and exposure to tobacco smoke were statistically associated with being colonized by P jirovecii.
The prevalence of P jirovecii in infants and toddlers with WC and the genotyping results provide evidence that this population represents a potential reservoir and transmission source of P jirovecii.

Restoring Anadromous Fish Habitat in Big Canyon Creek Watershed, 2004-2005 Annual Report.
SciTech Connect Rasmussen, Lynn 2006-07-01 The ''Restoring Anadromous Fish Habitat in the Big Canyon Creek Watershed'' is a multi-phase project to enhance steelhead trout in the Big Canyon Creek watershed by improving salmonid spawning and rearing habitat.
Habitat is limited by extreme high runoff events, low summer flows, high water temperatures, poor instream cover, spawning gravel siltation, and sediment, nutrient and bacteria loading.
Funded by the Bonneville Power Administration as part of the Northwest Power Planning Council's Fish and Wildlife Program, the project assists in mitigating damage to steelhead runs caused by the Columbia River hydroelectric dams.
The project is sponsored by the NezmoreÂ Â» Perce Soil and Water Conservation District.
Steelhead trout within the Snake River Basin were listed in 1997 as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Results include species composition, timing of migration, and habitat use.
Healthy functioning stream ecosystems provide society with many benefits, including water purification, flood control, nutrient recycling, waste decomposition, fisheries, and aesthetics.
Continued monitoring and assessment of the Nationâs streams is needed to support informed decisions that will safeguard this important natural and economic resource.
The quality of streams and rivers is often assessed with measures of the chemical or physical properties of water.
However, a more comprehensive perspective is obtained if resident biological communities are also assessed.
Guidelines to protect human health and aquatic life have been established for specific physical and chemical properties of water and have become useful yardsticks with which to assess water quality.
Biological communities provide additional crucial information because they live within streams for weeks to years and therefore integrate through time the effects of changes to their chemical or physical environment.
In addition, biological communities are a direct measure of stream healthâan indicator of the ability of a stream to support aquatic life.
Thus, the condition of biological communities, integrated with key physical and chemical properties, provides a comprehensive assessment of stream health.
A content analysis of interviews with three cohorts of risk managers in the water sector was undertaken.
The coding frequency of strategic risk terms from 18 structured interviews and 28 semi-structured interviews was used to appraise changes in the perceived importance of strategic risks within the sector.
Extended interviews with three utility risk managers from the UK, Canada and the United States were then used to contextualise the findings.
This research supports the ongoing focus on infrastructure resilience and the increasing prevalence of extrinsic risk within the water sector, as reported by the insurance sector and by water research organisations.
The extended interviews provided insight into how strategic risks are now driving the implementation agenda within utilities, and into how utilities can secure tangible business value from proactive risk governance.
Strategic external risks affecting the sector are on the rise, involve more players and are less controllable from within a utility's own organisational boundaries.

We aimed to describe the changing patterns among the most common bacterial causes in the USA after conjugate vaccination and to assess the association between adjunctive dexamethasone and mortality.
For this population-based observational study, we searched information available from hospital discharges about incidence and inpatient mortality for the most important causes of community and nosocomial bacterial meningitis based on International Classification of Diseases coding across all hospitals in the USA between 1997 and 2010 with the HealthCare Cost Utilization Project network database.
We calculated incidences according to United States Census Bureau data and used a negative binomial regression model to evaluate the significance of changes over time.
The incidence of Neisseria meningitidis infection decreased from 0Â·721 per 100â000 people in 1997, to 0Â·123 per 100â000 people in 2010 , which has placed this pathogen close to common bacterial causes of nosocomial meningitis such as staphylococcus and Gram-negative bacteria and to Haemophilus influenzae.
Water samples were collected for the current study during two synoptic surveys in 2014 and 2015.
Water samples were analyzed for fecal and total coliform bacteria, nitrate plus nitrite as nitrogen, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate, and human health and pharmaceutical products.
Water sampling occurred at 39 stream locations used during the 1997â99 study by the USGS and at 11 additional sites.
The poorest sanitary quality was within the urban area of the Municipality of Caguas, particularly in urban stream reaches of RÃ­o Caguitas and in rural and suburban reaches bordered by houses in high density that either have inadequate septic tanks or discharge domestic wastewater directly into the stream channels.
The best sanitary quality occurred in areas having little or no human development, such as in the wards of San Salvador and Beatriz to the south and southwest of Caguas, respectively.
The concentration of nitrate plus nitrite as nitrogen ranged from 0.02 to 9. milligrams per liter, and did not exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standard for nitrate as nitrogen of 10 milligrams per liter.

Molecular clock analysis revealed that clade 1 emerged in October 1997.
A total of 41 lineages of S suis emerged by the end of 2004 and rapidly expanded to 68 genome types through single base mutations when the outbreak occurred in June 2005.
We identified 32 identical isolates and classified them into 8 groups, which were distributed in a large geographic area with no transmission link.
These findings suggest that persons were infected in parallel in respective geographic sites.
This program is designed to assess the effects of highway runoff and urban runoff on Halawa Stream.
For this program, rainfall data were collected at two stations, continuous discharge data at one station, continuous streamflow data at two stations, and water-quality data at five stations, which include the continuous discharge and streamflow stations.
This report summarizes rainfall, discharge, streamflow, and water-quality data collected between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2006.
A total of 23 samples was collected over five storms during July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006.
The goal was to collect grab samples nearly simultaneously at all five stations, and flow-weighted time-composite samples at the three stations equipped with automatic samplers; however, all five storms were partially sampled owing to lack of flow at the time of sampling at some sites, or because some samples collected by the automatic sampler did not represent water from the storm.
Additionally, grab samples were analyzed for oil and grease, total petroleum hydrocarbons, fecal coliform, and biological oxygen demand.
Quality-assurance/quality-control samples were also collected during storms and during routine maintenance to verify analytical procedures and check the effectiveness of equipment-cleaning procedures.
Municipal wells are completed in the alluvial aquifer at approximately 40 to 80 feet deep.
The City of Cedar Rapids and the United States Geological Survey have been conducting a cooperative study of the groundwater-flow system and water quality near the well fields since 1992.
Previous cooperative studies between the City of Cedar Rapids and the United States Geological Survey have documented hydrologic and water-quality data, geochemistry, and groundwater models.
Water-quality samples were collected for studies involving well field monitoring, trends, source-water protection, groundwater geochemistry, evaluation of surface and ground-water interaction, assessment of pesticides in groundwater and surface water, and to evaluate water quality near a wetland area in the Seminole well field.
Typical water-quality analyses included major ions , nutrients , dissolved organic carbon, and selected pesticides including two degradates of the herbicide atrazine.
In addition, two synoptic samplings included analyses of additional pesticide degradates in water samples.
Physical field parameters were recorded with each water sample collected.
This report presents the results of water quality data-collection activities from January 1999 through December 2005.
Methods of data collection, quality-assurance samples, water-quality analyses, and statistical summaries are presented.
Data include the results of water-quality analyses from quarterly and synoptic sampling from monitoring wells, municipal wells, and the Cedar River.
A ground-water land-use study conducted in 1996 focused on areas with burley tobacco production in northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia.
Land-use studies are designed to focus on specific land uses and to examine natural and human factors that affect the quality of shallow ground water underlying specific types of land use.
Thirty wells were drilled in shallow regolith adjacent to and downgradient of tobacco fields in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province of the upper Tennessee River Basin.
Ground-water samples were collected between June 4 and July 9, 1997, to coincide with the application of the majority of pesticides and fertilizers used in tobacco production.
Ground-water samples were analyzed for nutrients, major ions, 79 pesticides, 7 pesticide degradation products, 86 volatile organic compounds, and dissolved organic carbon.
Nutrient concentrations were lower than the levels found in similar NAWQA studies across the United States during 1993-95.
Median nutrient concentrations were equal to or less than national median concentrations.
All pesticide concentrations in the basin were less than established drinking water standards, and pesticides were detected less frequently than average for other NAWQA study units.
Atrazine was detected at 8 of 30 of the wells, and deethylatrazine was found in 9 of the wells.
Volatile organic compounds Plain water consumption in relation to energy intake and diet quality among United States adults, 2005-2012.
PubMed An, R; McCaffrey, J 2016-10-01 The present study examined plain water consumption in relation to energy intake and diet quality among United States adults.
The first-difference estimator approach addressed confounding bias from time-invariant unobservables by using within-individual variations in diet and plain water consumption between two nonconsecutive 24-h dietary recalls.
Daily overall diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 was not found to be associated with the proportion of daily plain water in total dietary water consumption.
Promoting plain water intake could be a useful public health strategy for reducing energy and targeted nutrient consumption in United States adults, which warrants confirmation in future controlled interventions.
The amended rules require users of wells that divert tributary ground water to annually report the water pumped monthly by each well.
Opinions by representatives of the State of Kansas, presented before the Special Master hearing a court case concerning post-Compact well pumping, stated that the PCC approach does not provide the same level of accuracy and reliability as a TFM when used to determine pumpage.
In 1997, the United States Geological Survey , in cooperation with the CDWR, began a 2-year study to compare ground-water pumpage estimates made using the TFM and the PCC approaches.
The TFM approach uses an inline flowmeter to directly measure instantaneous discharge and the total volume of water pumped at a well.
The PCC approach uses electrical power consumption records and a power conversion coefficient to estimate the pumpage at ground-water wells.This executive summary describes the results of the comparison of the two approaches.
Specifically, the differences in instantaneous discharge measured with three portable flowmeters and measured with an inline TFM are evaluated, and the statistical differences in paired Virtual water and water self-sufficiency in agricultural and livestock products in Brazil.

Brazil is the world leader in the production and export of various agricultural and livestock products.
The country is either a strong net importer or a strong net exporter of these products.
The objective of this study is to determine the volume of virtual water contained in agricultural and livestock products imported/exported by Brazil from 1997 to 2012, and to define the water self-sufficiency index of agricultural and livestock products in Brazil.
The indexes of water scarcity , water dependency and water self-sufficiency were calculated for each Brazilian state.
Brazil is either a strong net importer or a strong net exporter of agricultural and livestock products among the Mercosur countries.
The indexes used in this study reveal that Brazil is self-sufficient in food production, except for a few products such as wheat and rice.
Horticultural products make up a unique product group with negative virtual water balance in Brazil.
Not even one of the most simple and important aqueous solutions, NaCl, escapes this assertion.
A requisite for the development of a force field for any water solution is the availability of a good model for water.
Despite the fact that TIP4P/2005 seems to fulfill the requirement, little work has been devoted to build a force field based on TIP4P/2005.
After unsuccessful attempts to produce accurate predictions for a wide range of properties using unity ionic charges, we decided to follow recent suggestions indicating that the charges should be scaled in the ionic solution.
In this way, we have been able to develop a satisfactory non-polarizable force field for NaCl.
An important achievement of our model is that it also accounts for the dynamical properties of the solution, a test for which the force fields so far proposed failed.
The same is true for the solubility and for the maximum in density where the model describes the experimental results almost quantitatively.
The price to pay is that the model is not so good at describing NaCl in the solid phase, although the results for several properties are still acceptable.
We conclude that the scaling of the charges improves the overall description of NaCl aqueous solutions when the polarization is not included.
T We find that two exchange bonds are antiferromagnetic and two are ferromagnetic , with an accuracy of approximately 1 K The determination of the four exchange constants is greatly facilitated using the exact high-temperature expansion of the weak-field susceptibility, effectively reducing the number of unknown parameters to two.
We have calculated the thermodynamic properties of the system and these can be compared with the results of future experiments.
K sharp increases are expected in the magnetization versus external magnetic field at approximately 6 and 12 T and higher fields due to level crossings.
Inelastic neutron scattering could check our predictions for the low-lying magnetic energy levels.

The ankle-brachial index was computed as the higher of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis systolic blood pressures for each leg divided by the higher brachial artery systolic blood pressure.
Overall, the prevalence of an ABI â¤0.90 , 0.90 to 0.99 , 1. to 1.39 , and â¥1.40 was 5.7%, 19.3%, 72.5%, and 2.6%, respectively.
The odds of PAD for the other Hispanic/Latino groups ranged from 1. to 1.8.
Although men had a more than threefold higher odds of an ABI â¥1.40 , the odds did not differ significantly by Hispanic/Latino background.
Compared with Mexican Americans, all other Hispanic/Latino background groups have a significantly higher odds of having PAD, with the odds being nearly threefold higher among Cubans.
The drainage ditch, which is a potential receptor for ground-water contaminants from Installation Restoration Site 4, intermittently discharges water to Corpus Christi Bay.
This report evaluates a new type of pore-water sampler developed for this investigation to examine the subsurface contamination beneath the drainage ditch.
The new type of pore-water sampler appears to be an effective approach for long-term monitoring of ground water in the sand and organic-rich mud beneath the drainage ditch.
Rain and snowmelt at land surface are partitioned into different pathways including runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, unsaturated-zone storage, and recharge.
A new package for MODFLOW-2005 called the Unsaturated-Zone Flow Package was developed to simulate water flow and storage in the unsaturated zone and to partition flow into evapotranspiration and recharge.
The package also accounts for land surface runoff to streams and lakes.
The approach assumes that unsaturated flow occurs in response to gravity potential gradients only and ignores negative potential gradients; the approach further assumes uniform hydraulic properties in the unsaturated zone for each vertical column of model cells.
The Brooks-Corey function is used to define the relation between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content.
Variables used by the UZF1 Package include initial and saturated water contents, saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity, and an exponent in the Brooks-Corey function.
Residual water content is calculated internally by the UZF1 Package on the basis of the difference between saturated water content and specific yield.
The UZF1 Package is a substitution for the Recharge and Evapotranspiration Packages of MODFLOW-2005.
The UZF1 Package differs from the Recharge Package in that an infiltration rate is applied at land surface instead of a specified recharge rate directly to ground water.
The applied infiltration rate is further limited by the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity.
The UZF1 Package differs from the Evapotranspiration Package in that evapotranspiration losses are first removed from the unsaturated zone above the evapotranspiration extinction depth, and if the demand is not met, water can be removed Trends in health care expenditures, utilization, and health status among United States adults with spine problems, 1997-2006.
PubMed Martin, Brook I; Turner, Judith A; Mirza, Sohail K; Lee, Michael J; Comstock, Bryan A; Deyo, Richard A 2009-09-01 Analysis of nationally representative survey data for spine-related health care expenditures, utilization and self-reported health status.
To study trends from 1997 to 2006 in per-user expenditures for spine-related inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and emergency services; and to compare these trends to changes in health status.
Although prior work has shown overall spine-related expenditures accounted for $86 billion in 2005, increasing 65% since 1997, the study did not report per-user expenditures.
Understanding population-level per-user expenditure for specific services relative to changes in the health status may help assess the value of these services.
We analyzed data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a multistage survey sample designed to produce unbiased national estimates of health care utilization and expenditure.
Spine-related hospitalizations, outpatient visits, prescription medications and emergency department visits were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.
Regression analyses controlling for age, sex, comorbidity, and time were used to examine trends from 1997 to 2006 in inflation-adjusted per-user expenditures, and utilization, and self-reported health status.
An average of 1774 respondents with spine problems was surveyed per year; the proportion suggested an increase in the number of people who sought treatment for spine problems in the United States from 14. million in 1997 to 21. million in 2006.
From 1997 to 2006, the mean adjusted per-user expenditures were the largest component of increasing total costs for inpatient hospitalizations, prescription medications, andemergency department visits, increasing 37% , 139% , and 84% , respectively.
A 49% increase in the number of patients seeking spine-related care was the largest contributing factor to increased outpatient expenditures.
The main purpose of this work is to assess the prevailing synoptic conditions as well as detailing the mesoscale effects by means of moisture sources and dynamic and thermodynamic instability analysis involved in the November 1997 Spanish severe weather episode.
In order to achieve the above, this flood event is described in terms of moisture content evolution by means of individual particle simulation along 3-day back-trajectories.
A Lagrangian model is applied in order to characterize the atmospheric particles involved in the focused case which give rise to sudden precipitation stream.
Geopotential height and temperature fields were used to describe the synoptic situation.
The results of this work suggest this flood event was due mainly to strong dynamic instability along with large amounts of moisture advected by a trough, while the thermodynamic instability played a secondary role.
Finally, a new methodology based on a technique proposed by Tremblay has been developed in order to separate the precipitation into stratiform and convective components.
It is evident that the event was associated with a predominant convective regime.
Samples were collected and analyzed from 17 ground-water monitoring wells located within the study area from September through December 2005.
Samples were analyzed for a variety of constituents including major ions, nutrients, volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, pesticides and degradates, oil and grease, phenols, total polychlorinated biphenyls, and other selected constituents.
Concentrations of nitrogen were generally less than 1 milligram per liter, and concentrations of phosphorus were generally less than 0. milligrams per liter.
Twelve of 79 pesticides and degradates were detected at 6 out of 17 wells.
Two semivolatile organic compounds, phthalate and total phenols), out of the 51 analyzed, were detected in the study area.

The maximum luminosity reached during this outburst was 1. times higher than in the previous outburst.
However, the spectral behavior during the two outbursts was very similar.
In particular, L disk was 4 proportional to Tin up to the same critical luminosity and in both outbursts there were periods during which the energy spectra were very soft, but could not be fit with standard disk models.
The four reservoirs, Rob Roy, Lake Owen, Granite Springs, and Crystal Lake, provide approximately 75 percent of the public water supply for Cheyenne, Wyoming.
Samples of water and bottom sediment were collected and analyzed for selected physical, chemical, and biological characteristics to provide data about the reservoirs.
Water flows between the reservoirs through a series of pipelines and stream channels.
The reservoirs differ in physical characteristics such as elevation, volume, and depth.Profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, and pH were examined.
Three of the four reservoirs exhibited stratification during the summer.
The profiles indicate that stratification develops in all reservoirs except Lake Owen.
Stratification developed in Rob Roy, Granite Springs, and Crystal Lake Reservoirs by mid-July in 1998 and continued until September, with the thickness of the epilimnion increasing during that time.
Secchi disk readings indicated Rob Roy Reservoir had the clearest water of the four reservoirs studied.The composition of the phytoplankton community was different in the upper two reservoirs from that in the lower two reservoirs.
Many of the species found in Rob Roy Reservoir and Lake Owen are associated with oligotrophic, nutrient-poor conditions.
In contrast, many of the species found in Granite Springs and Crystal Lake Reservoirs are associated with mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions.
The total number of taxa identified also increased downstream.The chemical water type in the reservoirs was similar, but dissolved-solids concentrations were greater in the downstream reservoirs.
These data were collected as a part of an ongoing cooperative study between the United States Geological Survey and the City of Independence Water Pollution Control Department to characterize the water quality and ecological condition of Independence streams.
The quantities, sources of selected constituents, and processes affecting water quality and aquatic life were evaluated to determine the resulting ecological condition of streams within Independence.
Data collected for this study fulfill the municipal separate sewer system permit requirements for the City of Independence and can be used to provide a baseline with which city managers can determine the effectiveness of current and future best management practices within Independence.
Continuous streamflow and water-quality data, collected during base flow and stormflow, included physical and chemical properties, inorganic constituents, common organic micro-constituents, pesticides in streambed sediment and surface water, fecal indicator bacteria and microbial source tracking data, and suspended sediment.
Dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, water temperature, and turbidity data were measured continuously at seven sites within Independence.
Base-flow and stormflow samples were collected at eight gaged and two ungaged sites.
Fecal sources samples were collected for reference for microbial source tracking, and sewage influent samples were collected as additional source samples.
Dry-weather screening was done on 11 basins within Independence to identify potential contaminant sources to the streams.
Benthic macroinvertebrate community surveys and habitat assessments were done on 10 stream sites and 2 comparison sites outside the city.
Two-thirds of sediment input to Detroit Lake originated in the upper North Santiam River subbasin.
Two-thirds of the sediment transported past Geren Island originated in the Little North Santiam River subbasin.
The highest annual suspended-sediment load at any of the monitoring stations was the result of a debris flow on November 6, 2006, on Mount Jefferson.
About 86 percent of the total sediment input to Detroit Lake was trapped in the lake, whereas 14 percent was transported farther downstream.
More than 80 percent of the sediment transport in the basin was in November, December, and January.
The variance in the annual suspended-sediment loads was better explained by the magnitude of the annual peak streamflow than by the annual mean streamflow.

Data recorded at two continuous water quality monitors in Agency Lake showed similar temperature patterns throughout the field season, but data recorded at the northern site showed more day-to-day variability for dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation after late June and more day-to-day variability for pH and specific conductance values after mid-July.
Data recorded from the northern and southern parts of Agency Lake showed more comparable day-to-day variability in dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH from September through the end of the monitoring period.
For Upper Klamath Lake, seasonal lows of dissolved oxygen concentrations and saturation were coincident with a seasonal low of pH values and seasonal highs of ammonia and orthophosphate concentrations, specific conductance values, and water temperatures.
Patterns in these parameters, excluding water temperature, were associated with bloom dynamics of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in Upper Klamath Lake.
In Upper Klamath Lake, water temperature in excess of 28 degrees Celsius was recorded only once at one site during the field season.
Large areas of Upper Klamath Lake had periods of dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 4 milligrams per liter and pH value greater than 9.7, but these conditions were not persistent throughout days at most sites.
Dissolved oxygen concentrations in Upper Klamath Lake on time scales of days and months appeared to be influenced, in part, by bathymetry and prevailing current flow patterns.
Diel patterns of water column stratification were evident, even at the deepest sites.
This map report shows the potentiometric surface of the Upper Floridan aquifer measured in September 2005.
This map represents water-level conditions near the end of the wet season, when ground-water levels usually are at an annual high and withdrawals for agricultural use typically are low.
Historical cumulative averages are calculated from regional rainfall summary reports and are updated monthly by the Southwest Florida Water Management District.This report, prepared by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Southwest Florida Water Management District, is part of a semi-annual series of Upper Floridan aquifer potentiometric-surface map reports for west-central Florida.
Four of the sampling periods took place during relatively low-flow conditions and two sampling periods took place during high-flow and flooding conditions; respectively.
Tangential-flow ultrafiltration with 10,000 nominal molecular weight limit, or daltons , pore-size membranes was used to separate metals in streamwater into ultrafiltrate and retentate components, respectively.
Conventional filtration with capsule filters and membrane filters and total-recoverable analysis of unfiltered samples were done for comparison at all sites.
Because the total-recoverable analysis involves an incomplete digestion of particulate matter, a more reliable measurement of whole-water concentrations is derived from the sum of the dissolved component that is based on the ultrafiltrate plus the suspended component that is based on a total digestion of colloid concentrates from the ultra-filtration retentate.
Metals in caddisfly larvae were determined for whole-body samples and cytosol extracts, which are intercellular solutions that provide a more sensitive indication of the metals that have been bioaccumulated.
Trace metals in acidic, metal-rich drainage from abandoned and inactive sulfide mines were observed to enter the Sacramento River system in predominantly dissolved form, as operationally defined using ultrafiltrates.
