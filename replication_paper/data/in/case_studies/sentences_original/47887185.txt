As we mark this anniversary, I certainly urge people to read Douglass&#39; book.

It&#39;s the structures, institutions and spirit of violence, war and evil that run rampant across the globe.
By punishing, silencing, and killing off the voices of truth, this Unspeakable evil pursued its warpath in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and Colombia and then the war on terrorism and the United States killings in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through meticulous research, Douglass argues that JFK began to understand our systemic commitment to war and nuclear weapons and decided to confront it.

The emptiness of the void, the vacuum of responsibility and compassion, is in ourselves.
As a growing precedent to JFK&#39;s assassination by his own national security state, we United States citizens supported our government when it destroyed whole cities , when it protected our Cold War security by world-destructive weapons, and when it carried out the covert murders of foreign leaders with &#39;plausible deniability&#39; in a way that was obvious to critical observers.
By bearing that witness of martyrdom, he taught, we will come to know what humanity really is in its glory, on earth as it is in heaven.
Blog | On the Road to Peace The assassination of John F Kennedy and 'Project Unspeakable' Nov 19, 2013 by John Dear This weekend, thousands will converge on Columbus, Ga., for the annual protest at the School of the Americas, a United States military training institution for Latin American militaries and death squads, officially called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.
Once again, we will mourn the dead, march for peace and call for the closing of this terrorist training camp.
But Friday, Nov., marks the 50th anniversary of President John F Kennedy's assassination.
Like with ""The Laramie Project,"" the ""Project Unspeakable"" script can be read by a dozen people and the production staged by activist groups around the country as a tool for political education and discussion.
The goal is to use live political theater to break the silence and propaganda around the assassinations of the Kennedys, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. and -as Douglass' book does -to show how and why United States government and military forces systemically killed our best leaders.
On Friday, Douglass, Randy Kehler, Kathy Kelly and I will be among the readers.
It's the best book on the assassination, perhaps the best book on a United States president and one of the best books that explains these last 50 years of war and corruption.
Douglass uses the writings of his friend Trappist monk Thomas Merton as a sounding board of faith and reason throughout the story.
The Unspeakable, Merton wrote, ""is the void that contradicts everything that is spoken even before the words are said, the void that gets into the language of public and official declarations at the very moment when they are pronounced, and makes them ring dead with the hollowness of the abyss.
Put another way, Merton's term ""the Unspeakable"" refers to the systemic evil and its darkness and shadow that surrounds us today.
If we open our eyes, we see it everywhere -the Snowden revelations that our government is spying and tracking possibly every human being on the planet, our secret wars and extrajudicial assassinations, the drone bombings, the loss of civil liberties, the total sellout to corporations and weapons manufacturers, the ongoing preparations for nuclear war, the failure to serve the poor at home and abroad -not to mention our destruction of the environment and active pursuit of catastrophic climate change.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the Unspeakable meant the war on communism, the active pursuit of global nuclear war, and war with Cuba, the Soviet Union and Vietnam.
By punishing, silencing, and killing off the voices of truth, this Unspeakable evil pursued its warpath in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama and Colombia and then the war on terrorism and the United States killings in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and elsewhere.
Through meticulous research, Douglass argues that JFK began to understand our systemic commitment to war and nuclear weapons and decided to confront it.
Then he began to take small steps to reverse our nuclear buildup and pull our troops out of Vietnam.
Indeed, Douglass argues that because of JFKâ€™s ongoing bad health, near-death experience on PT 109, and convictions about the flawed founding of the League of Nations, JFK had always been determined to give his life for peace, to help prevent another world war.
He paid for his pursuit of peace with his very life. googletag.cmd.push { googletag.display; }); Advertisement ""The Unspeakable is not far away,"" Douglass writes in a quote we will cite in Friday's performance.
Kennedy's assassination is rooted in our denial of our nation's crimes in World War II that began the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.
By avoiding our responsibility for the escalating crimes of state done for our security, we who failed to confront the Unspeakable opened the door to JFK's assassination and its cover-up.
If we pursue the truth, he insists we will find hope even in the darkness.
What Jesus was all about, what we as human beings are all about in our deepest nature, is giving our lives for one another.
But if we enter the story of the nonviolent Jesus and see with the eyes of truth as Merton and Douglass do, we can find the good fruit that comes from their lives and new courage to ""seek out the way of peace"" today.
That's what ""Project Unspeakable"" attempts to do -to look deep into the Unspeakable darkness of 50 years ago, a darkness that still grips our land, and in a spirit of truth and compassion, find the wisdom and strength to renew our journey to peace and truth.
I hope this 50th anniversary will inspire us to pursue the truth and deepen the struggle to close the SOA as well as the struggles to end drone warfare, government surveillance, systemic injustice, United States war-making, and environmental destruction, so that one day, future generations might be freed of violence and live in the light of justice, peace and nonviolence.
