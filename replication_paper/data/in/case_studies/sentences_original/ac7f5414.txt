Kennedy's strategy of flexible response, managed by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, was aimed to reduce the possibility of war by miscalculation.
However, Kennedy's policies also led to implementing the Bay of Pigs invasion and escalation of the Vietnam War.
Kennedy was committed to the rapid economic development of the newly organized nations in Africa and Asia.
Leadership team From election day until late December 1960, John F Kennedy, aided especially by his brother Robert F Kennedy, selected his foreign policy leaders.
He kept a few prominent holdovers, including J Edgar Hoover at the FBI and Allen Dulles as Director of Central Intelligence.
C Douglas Dillon, a Republican who had served as Eisenhower's Undersecretary of State was named Secretary of the Treasury.
Robert McNamara, who was well known as one of Ford Motor Company's ""Whiz Kids"", was appointed Secretary of Defense.
Rejecting liberal pressure to choose Adlai Stevenson as Secretary of State, and ignoring the powerful senator from Arkansas J William Fulbright, the president instead turned to Dean Rusk, a restrained former Truman official.
Stevenson accepted the mostly honorific appointment as the ambassador to the United Nations.
Robert Kennedy was selected as Attorney General, and the younger Kennedy was often referred to as the ""assistant president"" in reference to his wide range of influence.
President John F Kennedy with members of his White House staff Kennedy generally assigned the State Department to handle routine issues while major foreign policy decisions were handled in the White House.
The President's own reputation was built largely on his knowledge of world affairs, going back to his senior thesis at Harvard on British foreign policy in the 1930s.
Kennedy found it very difficult to get domestic legislation through a Democratic Congress, but discovered that he could make significant decisions on foreign policy without consulting Congress.
He set up the Peace Corps by Executive Order, and put his brother-in-law in charge.
The national security council staff, which did not need Senate approval, became a little State Department, and was headed by National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, a Harvard professor.
Other key White House aides included speechwriter Ted Sorensen, and advisers Arthur M Schlesinger Jr., press secretary Pierre Salinger, military expert General Maxwell D Taylor, and party leader W Averell Harriman.
Vice President Johnson had a minimal role in foreign policy; instead he was sent abroad on many ceremonial visits.
History of the Central Intelligence Agency and History of espionage The credibility of the CIA was wounded at the Bay of Pigs.
As a result, director Allen Dulles was replaced in September 1961 by John A McCone, another conservative Republican, after a brief battle in the Senate.
Communist states The communist world under Soviet leadership split up in the Kennedy era, with the Soviet Union and China increasingly at swords point.
The American strategy was to strongly oppose China, fearing that it had the greater potential to win support in the Third World.
Flexible response Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War.
Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which purported to stop the spread of Communism.
President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of nuclear weapons to deter the threat of Soviet aggression.
Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response.
As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts.
Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the United States to counter Soviet influence without resorting to war.
At the same time, he ordered a massive build-up of the nuclear arsenal to establish superiority over the Soviet Union.
In pursuing this military build-up, Kennedy shifted away from Eisenhower's deep concern for budget deficits caused by military spending.
In his 1960 presidential race, Kennedy strongly criticized Eisenhower's inadequate spending on defense.
In his inaugural address he promised “to bear any burden” in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems.
From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.
The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424.
He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles.
In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military–industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament.
Kennedy used the military as a political instrument more often than any other postwar president, with 13 episodes a year compared to four a year under Truman; seven per year for Eisenhower; nine per year for Johnson; and five per year for Nixon and Ford.
On November 29, 1961, American officials declared that the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union allegedly distributed a distorted, editorialized version of the Kennedy interview, given to Izvestiya employee Alexei Adzhubey.
According to United States officials, the omissions included Kennedy's charges that the Soviets had violated the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, as well as the moratorium on nuclear tests and his claim that the issue of divided Berlin largely stems from the Soviet refusal to agree to German reunification.
Adzhubey promised to publish the full text in Izvestiya and Kennedy publicly expressed his appreciation for that.
In January 1961, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev declared his support for wars of national liberation.
On February 15, 1961, the President asked Soviets to avoid interfering with United Nations pacification of the Congo Crisis.
On September 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United Nations General Assembly, revealing his commitment to veto the Troyka plan.
On February 27 of that year, in his letter to Khrushchev, the President offered an early summit meeting.
Khrushchev, however, tended to attribute the responsibility for the invasion not to Kennedy, but to his subordinates.
During his meeting with Khrushchev, Kennedy's main goal was to suggest a retraction from the Cold War.
Nonetheless, he did not believe that it would be feasible to change something either in divided Europe or in the Far East.
However, Kennedy did take the novel step of emphasizing the importance of Allied access to West Berlin.
The evidence suggests that Kennedy essentially accepted the permanent division of Berlin into East and West and implied that an East Berlin border closure would not bring a United States response as long as West Berlin was left alone.
Since he was already thinking about putting up a wall in Berlin, Khrushchev was encouraged to continue down this path.
The United States State Department prepared several papers for Kennedy on how to approach Khrushchev.
In spring 1963, Kennedy started to seek a further conciliation with the Soviet Union.
In the summer of that year, he sought to wind down the confrontational mentality that dominated American–Soviet relations and to replace standard anticommunist rhetoric with a conciliatory one.
It helped avoid a nuclear holocaust, since the nuclear confrontation was not then a stable balance of terror, but rather a highly unstable situation that was prone to accidents, misjudgements and escalating disaster.
The result was peace diplomacy that led to his collaboration with Khrushchev that succeeded in pulling the superpowers back from the brink.
China Before the Cuban missile crisis, policymakers in Washington were uncertain whether or not China would break with the Soviet Union on the basis of ideology, national ambitions, and readiness for a role in guiding communist activities in many countries.
Kennedy administration officials concluded that China was more militant and more dangerous than the Soviet Union, making better relations with Moscow desirable, with both nations trying to contain Chinese ambitions.
Diplomatic recognition of China remained out of the question, as a crucial veto power on the UN Security Council was held by America's ally on Taiwan.
Tensions escalated between the Moscow and Beijing, as Chinese leader Mao Zedong castigated Khrushchev's ""capitulation"" in the Cuban crisis.
With a partial thaw in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, China emerged as the biggest Cold War enemy in Kennedy's rhetoric.
To rally support at home for his ""Great Leap Forward"", Mao deliberately made the United States a highly visible enemy, and focused even more hostility against India, to the point of low-level 33-day war along their long border in late 1962.
The United States supported India, ignoring India's long-standing commitment to Moscow.
India realized it needed American financial help and munitions so Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in August 1963, wrote Kennedy explaining the challenges India faced from China and Pakistan.
The Chinese want people in Afro-Asian and Latin American countries to adopt militant, aggressive and revolutionary attitudes and are against democratic evolutionary practices and stable regimes.
After the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion, in late July 1962, the Soviet Union began sending its weaponry and military personnel to Cuba, citing the intents to protect Cuba from further invasions.
He postponed a military solution of the crisis strenuously advocated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and decided to impose a naval quarantine on Cuba.
On October 22, 1962 Kennedy informed the nation of the crisis, announcing the quarantine and demanding the removal of Soviet missiles.
Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a United States Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.
On October 27, in a letter to Nikita Khrushchev, Kennedy offered a noninvasion pledge for the removal of missiles from Cuba.
By that time, the fifteen Jupiter missiles were considered obsolete and had been supplanted by missile-equipped United States Navy Polaris subs.
During the crisis Kennedy showed his leadership talents, decision-making abilities and crisis management skills.
It contained Soviet expansion to the west, and kept the United States involved in European affairs while preventing West Germany or France from becoming too powerful.
Multipolarity In Europe The United States and the Soviet Union had retained firm leadership of their respective coalitions throughout the 1950s, but both blocs began to fracture during Kennedy's term.
President Charles de Gaulle vetoed Britain's application to join the Common Market in January 1963 after appearing receptive to the idea just months earlier.
De Gaulle pointed to the risk of a loss of cohesion in Common Market and the need to Maintain independence from the United States.
His chief reason was Britain's deal with the United States through NATO involving Polaris nuclear missile technology.
De Gaulle wanted a strong Europe free of any dependence on the United States, while Harold Macmillan and other British leaders considered their country's ""special relationship"" with the United States more important to its future.
In 1963, France and West Germany signed the Élysée Treaty, marking even closer relations between the two countries.
De Gaulle also rejected Kennedy's proposed Multilateral Force in favor of an independent nuclear weapons program.
Kennedy with The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace in 1961 By 1960, the United Kingdom had ceased their work on a national missile system and Eisenhower offered to make the American GAM-87 Skybolt available to the British as soon as it was improved.
The United Kingdom accepted the offer as the GAM-87 Skybolt would have ensured it a nuclear deterrent through most of the 1960s.
By mid-1962, however, United States Defense Secretary Robert McNamara had deemed the Skybolt project ""excessively expensive... with serious technical flaws"" and decided to cancel it.
Due to informational mishaps, President Kennedy was not informed that McNamara's decision would have serious political consequences for Harold Macmillan's government.
At a meeting with Macmillan, the President attempted to save the situation and offered the United Kingdom the UGM27 Polaris in lieu of Skybolt.
The related agreement dissatisfied French President Charles De Gaulle, who resented American preference toward Great Britain.
France Kennedy at a White House dinner in honor of the French Minister of Cultural Affairs André Malraux, 1962.
French President Charles De Gaulle, known for his preference to speak French to foreign guests, greeted Kennedy in English.
The French nuclear program was pivotal in De Gaulle's aim of restoring France's international reputation.
Kennedy administration had a firm commitment to the nuclear nonproliferation.
Kennedy was particularly dissatisfied with De Gaulle's intentions to assist West Germany in developing nuclear weapons.
On August 13, 1961, the East Germans, backed by Moscow, suddenly erected a temporary barbed wire barricade and then a concrete barrier, dividing Berlin.
Kennedy with the Chancellor of West Germany Konrad Adenauer in Bonn, 1963.
Two months later, a US-Soviet war nearly occurred as United States and Soviet tanks faced off across Checkpoint Charlie.
The crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov.
As a result of the Berlin crisis, Kennedy's government faced a dramatic increase in the defense budget.
The negative balance of payments with the European allies had aggravated American fiscal problems.
In late-1961, United States Defense Secretary McNamara concluded an arrangement with West Germany whereby the latter was to annually purchase some American military hardware.
On June 26, 1963, the President arrived in West Berlin and visited Checkpoint Charlie.
That day, he delivered his famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech in front of 150,000 West Germans.
In late October 1961, a dispute over the right of one United States diplomat to cross East Berlin flared into conflict.
Soviet and American tanks faced one another at Checkpoint Charlie, but Kennedy through an intermediary offered Khrushchev a conciliatory formula and both superpowers withdrew their tanks.
Kennedy's Asian initiatives particularly targeted India, as it followed a noncommunist model of economic development and was a member of the Nonaligned Movement.
Israel and Arab states Kennedy greets Golda Meir at the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1961 Kennedy firmly believed in the United States commitment to Israeli security, but his Middle Eastern policy saw ambitious Pan-Arabic initiatives of Gamal Abdel Nasser.
Kennedy ended the arms embargo that both the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel.
Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the United States and Israel.
Kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962.
Beginning in 1963, Kennedy allowed the sale to Israel of advanced United States weaponry , as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies which were opposed by Arab neighbours, such as its water project on the Jordan River.
In summer 1960, the United States embassy in Tel Aviv learned that Israel was assisted by France in the construction of what United States intelligence called ""a significant atomic installation"" in Dimona.
Even though David Ben-Gurion had publicly assured the United States that Israel did not plan to develop nuclear weapons, Kennedy tried unsuccessfully to persuade Israel to permit some qualified expert (either American or from some other friendly nation) to visit Dimona.
Nonetheless, Kennedy wished to work more closely with the modernizing forces of the Arab world.
In June 1962, Nasser wrote Kennedy a letter, noting that even though Egypt and the United States had differences, they could still cooperate.
Following the outburst of the North Yemen Civil War Kennedy, fearing that it would lead to a larger conflict between Egypt and Saudi Arabia , decided to recognize the revolutionary regime.
Under Eisenhower and Kennedy, policymakers were deeply divided between a hard-line interventionist faction and a more accommodating anti-interventionist faction.
By 1962, the Kennedy administration embraced regime change as the American goal.
The reason was the threat to Iraqi oil installations—not fear of a communist takeover.
Relations between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim.
Qasim undertook numerous repressive measures against the communists throughout 1960, and this—combined with the Kennedy administration's belief that Iraq was not important to the broader Cold War—resulted in the disestablishment of the SCI within days of Kennedy's inauguration as president.
However, subsequent events would return Iraq to the attention of American officials.
The United Kingdom, which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19 and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil supplies, responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter any Iraqi invasion.
At the same time, Kennedy briefly dispatched a United States Navy task force to Bahrain, and the U.K. brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union.
The situation was finally resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong Arab League force.
The Kennedy administration's initially ""low-key"" response to the stand-off was motivated by the desire to project an image of the United States as ""a progressive anti-colonial power trying to work productively with Arab nationalism"" as well as the preference of United States officials to defer to the U.K. on issues related to the Persian Gulf.
Following Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani's 1958 return to Iraq from exile in the Soviet Union, Qasim had promised to permit autonomous rule in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, but by 1961 Qasim had made no progress towards achieving this goal.
In July 1961, following months of violence between feuding Kurdish tribes, Barzani returned to northern Iraq and began retaking territory from his Kurdish rivals.
For the next month, United States officials in Iran and Iraq predicted that a war was imminent.
Faced with the loss of northern Iraq after non-Barzani Kurds seized control of a key road leading to the Iranian border in early September, Qasim finally ordered the systematic bombing of Kurdish villages on September 14, which caused Barzani to join the rebellion on September 19.
As part of a strategy devised by Alexander Shelepin in July 1961 to distract the United States and its allies from the Soviet Union's aggressive posture in Berlin, the Soviet KGB revived its connections with Barzani and encouraged him to revolt, although Barzani had no intention to act as a Soviet proxy.
The United States repeatedly refused Kurdish requests for assistance, but Qasim nevertheless castigated the Kurds as ""American stooges"" while absolving the Soviets of any responsibility for the unrest.
In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the Britishand American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company 's concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession.
United States officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as a UN member state, which they believed to be connected.
In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence in the country.
Around the same time, Kennedy instructed the Central Intelligence Agency —under the direction of Archie Roosevelt, Jr.—to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.
On June 2, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hashim Jawad ordered Jernegan to leave the country, stating that Iraq was also withdrawing its ambassador from Washington in retaliation for the United States accepting the credentials of a new Kuwaiti ambassador on June 1, which Iraq had warned would result in a downgrading of diplomatic relations.
Despite repeated Iraqi warnings, senior United States officials were stunned by the downgrade; Kennedy had not been informed of the likely consequences of accepting the Kuwaiti ambassador.
By the end of 1962, a series of defeats at the hands of Kurdish rebels had severely damaged both the Iraqi army's morale and Qasim's popular support.
From September 1962 through February 1963, Qasim repeatedly blamed the ""criminal activities"" of the United States for the battlefield successes of the Kurds, but the State Department rejected requests from the United States Chargé d'Affaires in Baghdad, Roy Melbourne, to publicly respond to Qasim's allegations out of fear that doing so would jeopardize the remaining United States presence in Iraq.
The CIA had earlier penetrated a top-secret Iraqi-Soviet surface-to-air missile project, which yielded intelligence on the Soviet Union's ballistic missile program.
Qasim's non-Ba'athist former deputy Abdul Salam Arif was given the largely ceremonial title of President, while prominent Ba'athist general Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was named Prime Minister.
The Kennedy administration viewed the prospect of an Iraqi shift in the Cold War with cautious optimism.
However, United States officials were worried that a renewal of conflict with the Kurds could threaten the Iraqi government's survival.
While Barzani had released 1,500 Arab prisoners of war as a gesture of good faith, Iraqi Foreign Minister Talib El-Shibib told Melbourne on March 3 that the government was unwilling to consider any concessions beyond cultural autonomy and was prepared to use anti-Barzani Kurds and Arab tribes in northern Iraq to co-opt the Kurds' guerrilla methods.
The fighting resumed on June 10, when the Iraqi government—which had amassed 45,000 troops in Iraqi Kurdistan—arrested members of the Kurdish negotiating delegation and declared martial law throughout northern Iraq.
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union actively worked to undermine the Ba'athist government, suspending military shipments to Iraq in May, convincing its ally Mongolia to sponsor charges of genocide against Iraq at the UN General Assembly from July to September, and sponsoring a failed communist coup attempt on July 3.
The Kennedy administration responded by approving a $55 million arms deal for Iraq.
The new United States ambassador to Iraq, Robert C Strong, informed al-Bakr of a Barzani peace proposal delivered to the U.S. consul in Tabriz on August 25; in response, al-Bakr ""expressed astonishment"" over American contacts with the Kurds, asking why the message had not been delivered through the Soviets.
Wolfe-Hunnicutt argues that the Kennedy administration's provision of military aid to the Ba'athist government, including napalm weapons, emboldened Iraqi hardliners and was counter-productive to the administration's stated preference for a diplomatic settlement to the First Iraqi–Kurdish War.
The Ba'athist government collapsed in November 1963 over the question of unification with Syria and the extremist and uncontrollable behavior of al-Sa'di's National Guard.
On November 21, 1963, the Kennedy administration determined that because Arif remained the Iraqi head of state, diplomatic relations with Iraq would continue unimpeded.
Laos After the election, Eisenhower emphasized to Kennedy that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be ""the cork in the bottle"" in regards to the regional threat.
As Pathet Lao received Soviet support, Kennedy ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to move into the South China Sea and drew marines with helicopters into Thailand.
He also instructed the American military advisers in Laos to wear military uniforms instead of the civilian clothes as a symbol of American resolve.
Nonetheless Kennedy believed that if both superpowers could convince their respective allies to move toward neutrality in Laos, that country might provide a pattern for settlement of future Third World conflicts.
In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a ""free"" Laos to a ""neutral"" Laos as a solution.
In April, 1961 the Soviet Union endorsed Kennedy's appeal for the cease fire in Laos.
Eventually an agreement was signed in July 1962, proclaiming Laos neutral.
The CIA had agents in the field and produced a steady stream of intelligence estimates for the White House and State Department.
In retrospect, the assessments and forecasts were clear, reliable, and mostly accurate.
However the White House decision-makers gave more credence to alternative forecasts which derived not from on-the-scene investigations but primarily from old assumptions about Communist objectives in Laos.
Turkey When Kennedy came to power, the American–Turkish relations were solidly based on the containment doctrine.
In April 1961 Kennedy asked for a review of the PGM-19 Jupiter deployment in Turkey.
The response, drafted in June by George McGhee, indicated that cancellation of the deployment might be seen as a sign of weakness in the aftermath of Nikita Khrushchev's hard-line position at the Vienna summit.
In January 1961, Kennedy, who also advocated for United States involvement in Vietnam when he was a United States Senator in 1956, assigned 28. million dollars to the enlargement of the South Vietnamese army and 12. million dollars to enhance the civil guard.
In May, he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnam's President Ngo Dinh Diem.
Johnson assured Diem of more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists.
Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem to defeat of communism in South Vietnam.
In October of the same year Kennedy dispatched General Maxwell D Taylor and Walt Rostow to South Vietnam to study the situation there.
They recommended sending 8,000 troops, but Kennedy authorized only a much smaller increase in the American advisers.
During his administration, Kennedy continued policies that provided political and economic support, and military advice and support, to the South Vietnamese government.
Late in 1961, the Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh.
By the end of 1961 the American advisers in Vietnam numbered 3,205 and that number increased from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but Kennedy was reluctant to order a fullscale deployment of troops.
Before his assassination, Kennedy used military advisors and special forces in Vietnam almost exclusively.
A year and three months later on March 8, 1965, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, committed the first combat troops to Vietnam and greatly escalated United States involvement, with forces reaching 184,000 that year and 536,000 in 1968.
In late 1961, President Kennedy sent Roger Hilsman, then director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to assess the situation in Vietnam.
There, Hilsman met Sir Robert Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam and the Strategic Hamlet Program was formed.
It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents.
It was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government.
Depending on which assessment Kennedy accepted (Department of Defense or State) there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded United States involvement.
Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam by July; despite increased United States support, the South Vietnamese military was only marginally effective against pro-communist Viet Cong forces.
On August 21, just as the new United States Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. arrived, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations.
The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'état to remove Diem with his brother, Nhu.
Lodge was instructed to try to get Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country.
Lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu, as originally planned.
At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by United States clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.
Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any United States influence.
The president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.
In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Taylor to a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy.
In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.
Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho , who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.
The final report declared that the military was making progress, that the increasingly unpopular Diem-led government was not vulnerable to a coup, and that an assassination of Diem or Nhu was a possibility.
In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot.
The source, Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh , wanted to know the United States position.
Later that month, as the coup became imminent, Kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him.
A policy of ""control and cut out"" was initiated to ensure presidential control of United States responses, while cutting him out of the paper trail.
On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by ""Big Minh"", overthrew the Diem government, arresting and then killing Diem and Nhu.
He found out afterwards that Minh had asked the CIA field office to secure safe-passage out of the country for Diem and Nhu, but was told that 24 hours were needed to procure a plane.
News of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in America and in South Vietnam—that the war might be won.
McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas.
It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia.
Historians disagree on whether Vietnam would have escalated if Kennedy not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964.
The film ""The Fog of War"" contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position with which Johnson disagreed.
Kennedy's interview with journalist Walter Cronkite on September 2, 1963, did not give a clear indication.
According to historian Dallek, Kennedy used this TV interview and a second one on NBC to pressure Diem on government reforms and second, to suggest future United States options.
At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam.
United States involvement in the region escalated until his successor Lyndon Johnson directly deployed regular United States military forces for fighting the Vietnam War.
Operation Mongoose, Kennedy Doctrine, and Brazil–United States relations during the João Goulart administration Play media Official motion picture on Kennedy's tour of Latin America in December 1961.
Its goals included long-term permanent improvement in living conditions.
The methods included advancing industrialization, increasing their exports and diversifying the products exported, reducing trade barriers between Latin American countries, and improving their communications systems.
The primary tactics were loans from the United States government and cash grants.
At a theoretical level, Kennedy's planners hoped to reverse the under-development of the region and its dependency on North America.
There was a fear that if the United States neglected the region, Castro's Cuba would introduce anti-American political and economic changes.
The Kennedy administration came to power in wake of the radicalization of Fidel Castro's Cuba, and saw the region as a Cold War battleground.
Kennedy believed communism could be thwarted by economic modernization through the Alliance for Progress.
Although it achieved far less than Kennedy had hoped, its ideals, together with Kennedy's personal qualities, gave him an unusual and lasting degree of popularity in Latin America.
Kennedy's sanguine welcome stood in sharp contrast to then-Vice President Richard Nixon's Latin America tour of May 1958.
His 1962 trip to Mexico evoked an enthusiastic response to his Alliance for Progress vision.
In that year Mexican President Adolfo López Mateos told Kennedy that for the sake of improvement of the Mexican–American relations the Chamizal dispute should be solved.
The United States and Mexican joint efforts in that field ultimately produced the Chamizal Convention.
New Nations Kennedy with Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of an independent Ghana, March 1961.
Between 1960 and 1963, twenty-four countries gained independence as the process of decolonization continued.
Many sought to avoid close alignment with either the United States or the Soviet Union.
In 1961, the leaders of India, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Ghana created the Non-Aligned Movement.
Instead of encouraging this development Kennedy wanted them to look to the United States as a role model.
He wooed their leaders, expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors.
He placed a special emphasis on Africa, and he forged close relationships with several African leaders.
Kennedy considered the Congo Crisis to be one of the most important foreign policy issues facing his presidency, and he supported a UN operation that prevented the secession of the State of Katanga.
Kennedy sought closer relations with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru through increased economic and a tilt away from Pakistan, but made little progress in bringing India closer to the United States.
Kennedy also hoped to minimize Soviet influence in Egypt through good relations with President Gamal Abdel Nasser, but Nasser's hostility towards Saudi Arabia and Jordan closed off the possibility of closer relations.
In Southeast Asia, Kennedy helped mediate the West New Guinea dispute, convincing Indonesia and the Netherlands to agree to a plebiscite to determine the status of Dutch New Guinea.
His administration established the Food for Peace program and the Peace Corps to provide aid to developing countries in various ways.
Together with the Alliance for Progress in Latin America they promoted modernization and development in poor nations.
Food for Peace program became a central element in American foreign policy.
It eventually helped many countries to develop their economies and become commercial import customers.
The Peace Corps grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the following year.
Africa G Mennen Williams with President of Tanganyika Julius Nyerere and President Kennedy in 1963 Kennedy had a special interest in Africa.
In 1959 he chaired the new subcommittee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
He named G Mennen Williams as his Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, directing him to tell African leaders that we wanted friendship with them and we wanted to recognize their independence.
Kennedy named young appointees to several embassies, such as William Attwood to Guinea and William P Mahoney to Ghana.
The Kennedy administration believed that the British African colonies would soon achieve independence.
According to Nigerian diplomat Samuel Ibe, ""with Kennedy there were sparks""; the Prime Minister of Sudan Ibrahim Abboud, cherishing a hunting rifle Kennedy gave him, expressed the wish to go out on safari with Kennedy.
Congo Crisis President Kennedy with Congolese Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula in 1962 Of all of the Africa-related issues confronting Kennedy upon assuming the presidency, none were handled very well.
According to White House aide Roger Hilsman, ""history could have hardly devised a more baffling and frustrating test"" for the administration than the situation in the Congo.
The Republic of the Congo was given its independence from Belgian colonial rule on June 30, 1960, but quickly fell into chaos five days later when the army mutinied.
On July 11, the breakaway State of Katanga under Moïse Tshombe declared independence from the Congo, followed the next month by South Kasai.
On July 13 the United Nations Security Council authorized the formation of the United Nations Operation in the Congo to help restore order in the country.
The Eisenhower administration hoped to reach a diplomatic solution before the Soviet Union intervened.
Attempts to exert influence on Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba failed, who alternatively brought in Soviet assistance to aid in suppressing the secessionist states.
Plans were drawn up by the United States government to depose Lumumba, including an assassination plot.
However, on September 5 the prime minister was dismissed by Congolese President Joseph Kasa-Vubu.
Lumumba contested the action, and on September 14 Colonel Joseph Mobutu launched a coup which definitively removed him from power and ordered the Soviets to leave the country.
On 27 November Lumumba fled the capital to form his own government in east with his deputy, Antoine Gizenga.
With technical support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu's troops managed to arrest him before he could succeed in reaching Stanleyville.
On 17 January 1961 discipline at the army base where Lumumba was detained faltered and he was flown to Élisabethville, Katanga.
Once there, he was brutally tortured at the hands of Tshombe and subsequently executed via firing squad.
Kennedy and his incoming advisers were apparently unaware of the CIA's involvement in Lumumba's death.
In fact, Kennedy wasn't even aware Lumumba had been killed until 13 February.
He had been of the opinion that Lumumba, though not to resume power, was to be released from prison.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State J Wayne Fredericks of the Bureau of African Affairs, the Kennedy administration's leading specialist on Africa, played a major role in constructing American policy for the suppression of Katanga.
On October 2, 1962 Kennedy signed United Nations bond issue bill to ensure American assistance in financing United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Congo and elsewhere.
Around this time, the Kennedy Administration was making private attempts to convince Tshombe to reunite the breakaway Katanga that he led with the Congo, in advance of UN intervention.
Peace Corps An agency to enable Americans to volunteer in developing countries appealed to Kennedy because it fit in with his campaign themes of self-sacrifice and volunteerism, while also providing a way to redefine American relations with the Third World.
Upon taking office, Kennedy issued an executive order establishing the Peace Corps, and he named his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as the agency's first director.
Kennedy proudly took the credit, and ensured that it remained free of CIA influence.
To avoid the appearance of favoritism to the Catholic Church, the Corps did not place its volunteers with any religious agencies.
In the first twenty-five years, more than 100,000 Americans served in 44 countries as part of the program.
Most volunteers taught English in local schools, but many became involved in activities like construction and food delivery.
Shriver practiced affirmative action, and women comprised about 40 percent of the first 7000 volunteers.
However given the paucity of black college graduates, racial minorities never reached five percent.
The Corps developed its own training program, based on nine weeks at an American university, with a focus on conversational language, world affairs, and desired job skills.
That was followed by three weeks at a Peace Corps camp in Puerto Rico, and week or two of orientation the home and the host country.
They promoted modernization models in order to reorient American aid to Asia, Africa and Latin America.
In the Rostow version in his The Stages of Economic Growth progress must pass through five stages, and for underdeveloped world the critical stages were the second one, the transition, the third stage, the takeoff into self-sustaining growth.
Rostow argued that American intervention could propel a country from the second to the third stage he expected that once it reached maturity, it would have a large energized middle class that would establish democracy and civil liberties and institutionalize human rights.
The result was a comprehensive theory that could be used to challenge Marxist ideologies, and thereby repel communist advances.
The model provided the foundation for the Alliance for Progress in Latin America, the Peace Corps, Food for Peace, and the Agency for International Development , and numerous programs in South Vietnam, especially building strategic hamlets against the communist threat.
Kennedy proclaimed the 1960s the ""Development Decade"" and substantially increased the budget for foreign assistance.
Modernization theory supplied the design, rationale, and justification for these programs.
The goals proved much too ambitious, and the economists in a few years abandoned the European-based modernization model as inappropriate to the cultures they were trying to impact.
Kennedy and his top advisers were working from implicit ideological assumptions regarding modernization.
They firmly believed modernity was not only good for the target populations, but was essential to avoid communism on the one hand or extreme control of traditional rural society by the very rich landowners on the other.
They believed America had a duty, as the most modern country in the world, to promulgate this ideal to the poor nations of the Third World.
They wanted programs that were altruistic, and benevolent—and also tough, energetic, and determined.
Michael Latham has identified how this ideology worked out in three major programs the Alliance for Progress, the Peace Corps, and the strategic hamlet program in South Vietnam.
Kennedy Round Europe had started to integrate economically and American policy was to encourage this, and to become more engaged with Europe.
The creation of the European Economic Community in 1957 lowered tariffs inside Europe.
It posed a challenge to Washington, warned Under Secretary of State George Ball, himself a committed Europeanist who had represented foreign steel producers as a trade lawyer.
The fear was that the United States with its higher standard of living, higher labor costs, and its insular political tradition would see American products losing markets in Europe.
Furthermore, there was a nagging fear that the Soviet economic growth was catching up with the United States.
The solution was reducing the tariffs between the United States and Europe.
However powerful business groups, especially chemicals, steel, machine tools, and electronics.
They had succeeded in 1958 in blocking Eisenhower's request for authority to negotiate reduced tariffs.
Nevertheless, Kennedy pressed for the passage of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gave the president authority to decrease duties up to 50% from their 1962 levels or increase them up to 50% from their 1934 levels.
After the act was passed, the administration pressed for a new round of multilateral trade talks to utilize its new authority, which would become known as the Kennedy Round as a memorial after Kennedy's death.
Legacy In terms of evaluating Kennedy's foreign policy, historians and biographers have been deeply split between highly favorable and quite negative.
One group praised Kennedy as a consummate pragmatist, skilled crisis manager, and, indeed, a great world leader.
They included Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Theodore Sorensen, and Roger Hilsman.
The opposition, angered and animated by the Vietnam War, launched their attack in the 1970s, focusing mostly on his responsibility for escalating the Vietnam War, his imperialism regarding Latin America and Africa, and his repeated promises to be the aggressive cold warrior who would challenge the Soviets more vigorously than Eisenhower did.
They included David Halberstam, Louise Fitzsimons, Richard J Walton, and Henry Fairlie.
Vietnam and the Cold War are the two major issues that faced the Kennedy presidency.
However, there is general scholarly agreement that his presidency was successful on a number of lesser issues.
Thomas Paterson finds that the Kennedy administration helped quiet the crisis over Laos; was suitably cautious about the Congo; liberalized trade; took the lead in humanitarianism especially with the Peace Corps; helped solve a nasty dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands; achieve the Limited Test Ban Treaty; created a new Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; defended Berlin; and strengthened European defenses.
His willingness to negotiate with Khrushchev smoothed the Berlin crisis, and Kennedy's personal diplomacy earned him the respect of Third World leaders.
Fifty-some years after his assassination, John F Kennedy remains an enigma.
Various studies portray him as a Cold War liberal, or a liberal Cold Warrior, or come up with pithy phrases to summarize the man and his foreign policy.
Barzani envoys called on United States officials in Baghdad and Washington, requesting arms supply and political support and offering to help defeat communism in Iraq, return Iraq to the Baghdad Pact, and provide intelligence about neighboring states.
State Department officials refused these requests on the grounds that the Kurdish problem was an internal matter for Iraq, Iran, and Turkey to handle.
King Hussein of Jordan later alleged that United States intelligence supplied the Baath with the names and addresses of those Communists, and an Iraqi Baathist leader confirmed to the scholar Hanna Batatu that the Baath had maintained contacts with American officials during the Qassim era.
Scholars remain divided in their interpretations of American foreign policy toward the February 1963 coup in Iraq.
Washington wanted to see Qasim and his Communist supporters removed, but that is a far cry from Batatu's inference that the United States had somehow engineered the coup.
The United States lacked the operational capability to organize and carry out the coup, but certainly after it had occurred the United States government preferred the Nasserists and Ba'athists in power, and provided encouragement and probably some peripheral assistance.
