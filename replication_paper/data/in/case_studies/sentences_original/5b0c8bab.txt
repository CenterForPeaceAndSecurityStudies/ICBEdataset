This, is also the point when there could have been another World War at our doorstep.
This also marks the most heightened movement in the Cold War that could have gone fully nuclear.Cold WarThe origin of the cold war can be seen as a power struggle between the United States and USSR that happened from 1950 to 1991.
It was later followed by a lot of policies and tiny events that forced it to turn into a massive confrontation between the two superpowers.
The building of the Berlin Wall is another reason.Photo by Tomas Val on UnsplashThe United States was following a policy called Marshal Plan which was providing aid to European countries which were devastated by World War 2.
USSR tried to confront this move with Stalin trying to interfere in Europe against the United States increasing influence.
To reciprocate the same USSR created Warsaw Pact with the communist countries.
Cold War is about United States led-NATO and USSR led-Warsaw Pact.Truman Doctrine was a policy created to support countries that were under direct threat from USSR or the communist influence.
The United States never wanted countries of Latin and South America to grow closer with the opposite bloc.
This angered the United States and it tried a policy of containment that is to restrict the growth of the USSR beyond its traditional borders.The most notable of such was Cuba, which is an island nation offshore the United States state of Florida.
This was an area of United States interest as it was strategically located.
The United States has been supporting oil refineries and sugar industries in Cuba under Batista, who had suspended civil liberties in the country.
There was massive anger against the government.It was then a law graduate, Fidel Castro formed his own party and decided to contest the corrupt regime under Batista.
After a long period of struggle, Castro took power through guerrilla military support, with Batista fleeing the nation.
The United States was supplying arms and moral support to Batista to keep him in power.The United States was still in a hope to keep Cuba under its influence, but Castro was too anti-US for its previous interventions.
The most important policy Castro followed was the nationalisation of the resources and economy.
Youth who were influenced by American culture could no longer carry forward the same due to strained relationships.The US, instead of responding with soft diplomacy and restraining itself, tried for economic warfare and embargo.
Deteriorating relations forced the United States to look for options to throw out the Castro govt.
It started to aid rebels and those who opposed his regime.60 saw a French ship exploding at the Havana harbour for which the United States blamed the Castro govt.
This made everything worse between Castro and then-President Eisenhower.
United States tried multiple assassination attempts of Castro within the United States also in Cuba.
The most notable one was the Bay of Pigs Invasion, which was perpetrated by the CIA by training armed rebels in Cuba and trying to overthrow the government.CreditsThe EconomistThe mission name is derived from a region to the south of Cuba which is not at all inhabited.
The entire process turned out to be a massive embarrassment for the Kennedy Administration and thus, they came out with another plan.In order to make up for a failed mission, the CIA initiated Operation Mongoose to hold a coup and assassinate Fidel Castro.
The United States then decided to suspend trade ties between both nations.
In February, the United States declared a complete embargo on the country.Europe similarly saw a tight fight between the East and the West.
The Soviet Union had placed Long and Medium Range missiles on the border with the NATO countries, this raised the threat level in the region.To counter the same, the United States chose to deploy Jupiter MRBM in Turkey which is strategically located close to Russia.
Another important destination for the same was Italy that was located on the Mediterranean coast.
This was part of NATOâs nuclear sharing policy, where NATO will arm non-nuclear states with nuclear weapons.On the other side, in Cuba, Castro was wary of any misadventures by the United States and decided to extend full fletched relations with the Soviets.
USSR, unlike the US, didnât have a proper arsenal of Long Range missiles.
But the funda here was that the entire world never knew about Cuba hosting Soviet missiles.
It was only in September 1962 that United States intelligence found Short and Medium range missiles using Lockheed Martin bombers.The main reason why it was found was because of the growing amount of ice that was being taken away from urban to rural areas for cooling the missile system.The Kenedy government-issued public statement against the same.
This warning was categorically ignored and continued the supply of weapons.
The United States was angered by the move and decided to confront the Soviet ships carrying missiles to Cuba.
The United States called this a naval quarantine and not a blockade.CreditsThe British libraryOn 20th October 1962, we could witness Chinaâs PLA invading Indian borders into Aksai Chin which is also known as China Occupied Kashmir.
But, this was not taken forward; instead, Kennedy wrote a letter to Khrushchev calling the move by USSR unacceptable.
Khrushchev responded by saying that it wonât adhere to the United States instructions and will proceed further.
The United States navy blocked soviet ships, but the majority of them, not having missiles, were allowed to move.
Tensions were raised further to DEFCON 2, which is equivalent to any war preparedness with the involvement of airpower.
Nothing could progress from either side and thus, the situation was almost a stalemate.On October 26, an ABC News reporter John Scali approached the White House claiming that he was asked by a Soviet agent to solve the stalemate.
He said that USSR was ready to missiles from Cuba if the United States promised not to invade Cuba anymore.
On the same night, Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy, as an indication of toning down of the tense situation.The very next day, Khrushchev sent a letter to the White House indicating a deal which said that the United States should remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey although this was directly hidden from the public.
The same day, there was an unfortunate incident of the USâ U-2 reconnaissance jet being shot down close to Cuba.
Despite that diplomatic moves went on one hand while the war on the other hand.The United States administration was forced to keep everything secret, and also the United States kept the idea of withdrawing Jupiter from Turkey out of the missile crisis.
The crisis was over on paper but it took time for USSR to withdraw its IL-28 bombers.
The United States moved Jupiter missiles from Turkey only in April 1963.
Despite all the noise, this was one of the tipping points in the history of the Cold War.
No one understanding the Cold War cannot ignore this tiny chapter.The lessons learntBoth United States and USSR kept distrusting each other and trying to contain each otherâs influence.
They both tried to interfere across the globe to exert their influence and also as part of the rivalry.
Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Cuba, Egypt, Libya, only to name a few.
USâs policy of treating its foes brutally is still harming many countries.Disputed Regions of the WorldLooking into states, wars, and conflicts.
The causes for theâ¦historyofyesterday.comThe United States could have easily avoided the Bay of Pigs invasion and its assassination attempts of Fidel Castro.
Similarly, USSR could not have given missiles to Cuba, which is highly dangerous.
Similarly, USSR was also able to muster strength amidst the distress at home.
Also, it's commendable that both Heads of State put humanity ahead of their selfish interests and power.
It also proves that humanity is way beyond national borders, which divide us artificially.
The policy of expansion and containment, followed by using developing countries for their geopolitical gains.
Today, it's not about the military might but also economics, trade, technology, cyber-warfare and a lot more.Rome was never built in a day.
Similarly, Cold War also didnât happen of a sudden, it was a collection of events that led to it.
History is not just about events but the process of reaching that events.
Each event has a lot of underlying truths, sometimes one or two or even a hundred.History shouldnât be the tool to divide people today but a lesson for us to correct the mistakes which someone else did.
No country needs to fight like hell to prove its presence or exert influence.
