Good riddance to a dead dictator Written By Steven M Lopez | Nov 27, 2016 WASHINGTON, November 27, 2016 â In October 1962, President John F Kennedy narrowly avoided World War III with the Soviet Union.
The conflict centered on Russiaâs stationing short-range nuclear weapons on Cuban soil, a mere 90 miles off the United States mainland.
Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove his missiles from Cuba after Kennedy assured the Russians the United States would remove its short-range nukes from Turkey and promised not to invade Cuba.
Grateful Americans said grace with a renewed sense of earnestness the following November before digging into their thanksgiving dinners.
What Castroâs death means for Cuba But one man was fuming mad â Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
During the height of the nuclear crisis, Castro wrote Khrushchev, begging him to launch a nuclear first strike against the United States âto eliminate this danger forever, in an act of the most legitimate self-defense.
However harsh and terrible the solution, there would be no other.â Khrushchev later wrote back, âWe have lived through a very grave moment, a global thermonuclear war could have broken out.
It is even difficult to say how things would have ended for the Cuban people.â But as was always the case, the Cuban people were the least of Castroâs concerns.
Here in the land of the free, there is no statute of limitations for murder.
But justice is a malleable concept to those sympathetic to totalitarian, communist dictators.
In spite of the Cuban dictator and his supporters, the nation he so hated, the one âconceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,â endures.
