Kennedy and his advisers were stunned to learn that the Soviet Union was, without provocation, installing nuclear-armed mediumand intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba.
Kennedy Library for 23 years and the first scholar to evaluate the ExComm tapes—is among the numerous historians who have tried to set the record straight.
Nikita Khrushchev was acutely aware of America’s huge advantage not just in the number of weapons but in their quality and deployment as well.Kennedy and his civilian advisers understood that the missiles in Cuba did not alter the strategic nuclear balance.Moreover, despite America’s overwhelming nuclear preponderance, JFK, in keeping with his avowed aim to pursue a foreign policy characterized by “vigor,” had ordered the largest peacetime expansion of America’s military power, and specifically the colossal growth of its strategic nuclear forces.
The Soviets were entirely justified in their belief that Kennedy wanted to destroy the Castro regime.Kennedy and his civilian advisers understood that the missiles in Cuba did not alter the strategic nuclear balance.
A missile is a missile,” Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara asserted.
In light of the extreme measures they executed or earnestly entertained to resolve a crisis they had largely created, the American reaction to the missiles requires, in retrospect, as much explanation as the Soviet decision to deploy them—or more.The Soviets suspected that the United States viewed a nuclear first strike as an attractive option.
The second risk was that America’s friends would suddenly doubt that a country given to appeasement could be relied on to fulfill its obligations.In fact, America’s allies, as Bundy acknowledged, were aghast that the United States was threatening nuclear war over a strategically insignificant condition—the presence of intermediate-range missiles in a neighboring country—that those allies had been living with for years.
It seems never to have occurred to Kennedy and the ExComm that whatever Washington gained by demonstrating the steadfastness of its commitments, it lost in an erosion of confidence in its judgment.This approach to foreign policy was guided—and remains guided—by an elaborate theorizing rooted in a school-playground view of world politics rather than the cool appraisal of strategic realities.
According to the version of events propagated by the Kennedy administration , Washington unequivocally rebuffed Moscow’s offer and instead, thanks to Kennedy’s resolve, forced a unilateral Soviet withdrawal.Beginning in the late 1980s, however, the opening of previously classified archives and the decision by a number of participants to finally tell the truth revealed that the crisis was indeed resolved by an explicit but concealed deal to remove both the Jupiter and the Cuban missiles.
He explained that “if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by either friend or foe,” then the United States could not tolerate such conduct by the Soviets—even though, again, he had privately acknowledged that the deployment of the missiles did not change the nuclear balance.This notion that standing up to aggression will deter future aggression fails to weather historical scrutiny.
Just as Kennedy and his advisers perceived a threat in Soviet efforts to offset what was in fact a destabilizing United States nuclear hegemony, so today, both liberals and conservatives oxymoronically assert that the safety of the United States demands that the country must “balance” China by maintaining its strategically dominant position in East Asia and the western Pacific—that is, in China’s backyard.
Certainly America’s security wouldn’t be jeopardized if other great powers enjoy their own spheres of influence.This esoteric strategizing—this misplaced obsession with credibility, this dangerously expansive concept of what constitutes security—which has afflicted both Democratic and Republican administrations, and both liberals and conservatives, is the antithesis of statecraft, which requires discernment based on power, interest, and circumstance.

In the midst of that crisis, the sanest and most sensible observers—among them diplomats at the United Nations and in Europe, the editorial writers for the \u003ci\u003eManchester Guardian\u003c/i\u003e, Walter Lippmann, and Adlai Stevenson—saw a missile trade as a fairly simple solution.

A declassified Soviet cable reveals that Robert Kennedy—whom the president assigned to work out the secret swap with the U.S.S.R.’s ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin—insisted on returning to Dobrynin the formal Soviet letter affirming the agreement, explaining that the letter “could cause irreparable harm to my political career in the future.”\""},{\""__typename\"":\""ArticleParagraphContent\"",\""idAttr\"":\""\"",\""subtype\"":null,\""innerHtml\"":\""Only a handful of administration officials knew about the trade; most members of the ExComm, including Vice President Lyndon Johnson, did not.
