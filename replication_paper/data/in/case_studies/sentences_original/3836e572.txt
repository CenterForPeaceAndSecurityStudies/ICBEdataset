Sam Cooke, Lou Adler, Herb Alpert, performed by Sam Cooke : Don’t know much about history, Why I’m here’s a mystery, Never opened any science books, I was hired strictly for my looks.
Though my answers make your hair curl,It’s not nice to beat up on a girl,And that’s why I’m press sec-re-tar-y.
Don’t know much about geography,I’m like Chimpy, ‘cept I wear a bra,As I shit upon the rule of law.
Really don’t know very much at all,So I stammer and dodge and stallThat’s my job as press sec-re-tar-y.
Latatatatatatahuwaah Oehwoewoe Latatatatatatahuwaah Oehwoewoe Really don’t know very much at all,So I stammer and dodge and stallThat’s my job as press sec-re-tar-y.
Everytime I hear a reference to, “The Pet Goat”, the line about, “…looked at the pictures and I turned the pages…”, comes to mind.
Or maybe you prefer that special brand of plastic people that republicans are always so taken with.

Don’t know about James Taylor, but I do remember the Paul Simon version.
No wonder you get so cranky… nonnie9999 December 13, 2007 at 2:48 pm the only thing i have to hold is my breath. i hold my breath wondering if the money pit crew is going to show up and finish, and i hold my breath so i am not constantly inhaling chunks of wallboard and insulation. of course, you never have to hold your breath waiting for them to cash the checks. they seem to always be on time for that part of the job.
