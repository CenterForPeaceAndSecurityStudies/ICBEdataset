At the time, his initial reaction to the Soviet missile emplacement was that the United States should reply with tremendous force, even though he acknowledges it would have been a little presumptuous to think the Soviets would not have launched missiles in retaliation.
Even so, he contends that it was necessary to balance the inability to neutralize every Soviet missile with the consequences of subsequent events, by which he means Cuban activities in the hemisphere and in Africa.
If the United States had invaded and straightened the whole mess in Cuba out, it would have avoided a lot of subsequent difficulties.
Admiral Anderson explains the decision-making process that led to the Cuba blockade.
He also gives a sense of what Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings were like and describes the Navys operations in carrying out the blockade.
One of the lessons he draws from the crisis is the need to keep civilian authorities informed of the action but without letting them interfere with military operations.
Repeatedly expressing pride in the Navys performance, he notes for example its success in forcing Soviet subs to the surface during the quarantine.
Denying that those actions were provocative, he adds that if they had been nuclear subs ... it would have been more complicated.
He briefly mentions the circumstances surrounding his own removal as CNO, which he attributes to McNamara.
Reflecting on the crisis, he concludes that Khrushchev backed down solely because he knew he faced superior force.
Although he reports that the Air Force was ready to deploy nuclear weapons provided the Soviets chose to use them first, he notes that the world would be a lot better off if we ... scrapped them all.

Nuclear Age highlights the profound changes in contemporary thinking imposed by the advent of nuclear weapons.
I remember leaving the White House at the end of that Saturday and thinking that might well be the last sunset I ever saw,” recalls former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara of Black Saturday, the day the Cuban missile crisis pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war.
The United States effort to overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs was an expression of President Kennedy’s disbelief about the missiles in Cuba while it surprised Soviet leader Khrushchev according to his speechwriter,Feodor Burlatsky.
