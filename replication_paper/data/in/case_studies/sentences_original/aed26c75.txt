It makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear weapon contains almost 10 times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War.
There are better ways to peace than simply building up one’s nuclear stockpile. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“We must, therefore, persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communist bloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us.
We must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the Communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace.
Nuclear crisis management is too dangerous; we must therefore avoid confrontations that could force an adversary to choose between humiliating retreat or nuclear war. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved.
Are there ways to resolve your differences? -------------------------------------------------------------------------“ have also been talking in Geneva about our first-step measures of arm controls designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and reduce the risk of accidental war.
Our primary long-range interest in Geneva, however, is general and complete disarmament, designed to take place by stages, permitting parallel political developments to build the new institutions of peace which would take the place of arms.
The pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this government since the 1920s.
States must eliminate nuclear weapons. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“I'm taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two important decisions in this regard.
First, Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, and I have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in Moscow looking towards early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty.
Our hope must be tempered -Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history; but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind.
When we talked about this later, he said we had to remember that they were trained to fight and to wage warthat was their life.
It is important for civilians to hold reins of power during crisis and to challenge the military.
America did not win the crisis as a result of its toughness towards the Soviets. -------------------------------------------------------------------------“Kennedy believed his policy had worked for three reasons.
Later Nixon used the Missile Crisis to justify his failure to consult Congress over Cambodia.
I trust we don’t have another situation like Cambodia, but I do know that in the modern world, there are times when the Commander-in-Chief…will have to act quickly.
I can assure the American people that this president is going to bend over backward to consult the Senate and consult the House whenever he feels it can be done without jeopardizing the lives of American men.
Crises necessitate quick action that, at times, may mean acting quickly without input of other influential individuals.
Where the Soviet Union threatened to move nuclear weapons into Cuba and President Kennedy recognized that that was totally unacceptable to the United States and he communicated that very forcefully to the head of the Soviet Union, and the net result was any Soviet actions that put nuclear weapons into Cuba was stopped.
But if there hadn't been a negotiation on ending that action, by the Soviet Union, you could have had a serious military exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Crisis management requires a combination of strength and diplomacy during negotiations with an adversary.
Engagement with adversaries and honoring past promises are necessary for crisis management.
Our nuclear weapons outnumbered theirs almost 10 to one; the Soviets took their missiles out of Cuba and Khrushchev backed down.
Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof -the smoking gun -that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.
As President Kennedy said in October of 1962, 'Neither the United States of America, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small.
It is necessary to negotiate in crises, but only from a position of strength.
Ben Rhodes says that Obama also often cites the successful resolution of the crisis as an example of what can come from negotiations, even if there is no immediate resolution.
Only five months before, JFK held a summit in Vienna with Nikita Khrushchev.
Access to wide and varied opinions is necessary in formulating a crisis response.
