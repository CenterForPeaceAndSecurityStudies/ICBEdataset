President John F Kennedy's continuous patience and willingness to settle the conflict peacefully helped keep the Cold War from becoming a nuclear nightmare, and helped progress towards the end of a political dogfight.
The Cold War was escalating in hostility and the Soviet's communist regime was moving westward closer to the United States when Cuba fell into communism.
Kennedy had exceptional patience when negotiating with the Soviets, and it was his willingness to try an unorthodox strategy that was the main reason this threatening issue was settled.
The Crisis in Cuba was the climax of the Cold War, and after it was settled by Kennedy, the Cold War began its decline.
Since the end of World War Two the Soviet Union has had a strong communist control over a large part of Eastern Europe.
The Soviet Union had missiles set up in Cuba for some time before the Crisis occurred, however the Soviets claimed that they were only for defensive purposes.
It was in October of 1962 that the Soviet Union aimed many different types of missiles, including nuclear, directly at the United States emulating an offensive attack.
The Cold War caused distrust amongst the two nations; this caused the United States and the Soviet Union to fear nuclear annihilation.
The Soviets built a missile base in Cuba, which proved to be extremely treacherous to America's safety.
This is when the Soviets, under the order of Nikita Khrushchev, attempted to gain some leverage in the war by placing several medium range nuclear missiles on the communist island of Cuba.
With the Soviet Union right behind the United States in the arms race for the Cold War, the Soviet Union needed an extra boost to guarantee its defenses.
