The most dramatic moments of that crisis—the famed “thirteen days—lasted from October 16, 1962, when President Kennedy first learned that the Soviet Union was constructing missile launch sites in Cuba, to October 28, when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev publicly announced he was removing the missiles from the island.
Tensions continued, however, until November 20, when Kennedy lifted the blockade he had placed around Cuba after confirming that all offensive weapons systems had been dismantled, and that Soviet nuclear-capable bombers were to be removed from the island.
The potential for a nuclear war was real, and the following Miller Center exhibits from our Kennedy collection capture the president's thoughts and the advice he was receiving.
