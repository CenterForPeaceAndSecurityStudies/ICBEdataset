In a TV address on October 22, 1962, President John F Kennedy notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact a naval blockade around Cuba and made it clear the United States was prepared to use military force if necessary.
Disaster was avoided when the United States agreed to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchevâ€™s offer to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for the United States promising not to invade Cuba.
