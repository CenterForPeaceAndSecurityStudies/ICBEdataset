The tense 13-day affair between the United States and Soviet Union nearly led to nuclear war.
On 15 October 1962 United States President John F Kennedy received air recon photos of medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles under construction in Cuba.
Kennedy and his advisors debated how to respond, with many officials arguing for an invasion of Cuba.
Kennedy decided to institute a naval quarantine to prevent the delivery of more missiles, and he sent a letter to Khrushchev demanding that the missiles already in Cuba be dismantled and removed.
After a series of communications between Soviet and United States leaders, United States attorney general Robert Kennedy met secretly with Soviet ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin on 27 October.
Robert Kennedy said that the United States had already been planning to remove missiles of its own from Turkey, something the Soviet Union wanted, but would not publicly make that part of a resolution to the crisis.
Finally, on 28 October, Khrushchev publicly agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba.
