LJ ndennining Castro's political autho;'ity by removing his beard also occurred to the CIA, who planned to introduce depilatory powder into his shoes so that his beard would fall out.
According to Henry Brandon the idea was originally that of the novelist and erstwhile British naval intelligence officer, Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond.
For a different version of the plot against Castro's beard, see Beschloss, Ke/l/ler(v 11.
A further irony was that some of the 12 Sea Furies eventually sold to Batista, helped in Castro's military victory over the emigres at t he Bay of Pigs.
Dulles also imparted his view that, 'Castro was not only a bad man but had a streak of lunacy in his make-up which might have incalculable results.
This proved both the high point for British exports, and the last trade surplus.

No such ridicule, or course, attached itself to the unilateral declarations of an American President in 1823.
Kennedy's anger at Gromyko's behaviour was viewed sympathetically within the Foreign Oflicc.
Roberts also alluded to the long tradition of deception in Russian foreign policy dating back to Peter the Great.
Eisenhower's initial denials concerning U-2 flights over the USSR and Kennedy administration statements over the Bay of Pigs invasion, were examples of American disregard for the injunctions of Sir Harold Nicholson.
Kennedy himself, was less prosaic, referring to Mr Gromyko as that 'lying bastard', Brugioni, E)'eball to E.~eball, 287.
For details of the U-2 missions see Brugioni, Eyeball to Eve/Jall, passIm.
A receptionist at CIA headquarters was \'erheard speculating about the numbel's of 'methodists' visiting the agency.
Macmillan suggests that the source for this was the President who had spoken to Ormsby-Gore in guarded terms.
Ormsby-(;ore explained that Sir Hugh Stephenson would provide the Foreign Secretary with a lilll report on his return.
This same account states that Kennedy briefed Macmillan on the phone later that evening.
No other evidence supports this suggestion, and as Macmillan was at Chequers on Saturday, which lacked a secure telephone facility, it seems unlikely.

The CIA knew, presumably assisted by Penkovsky's material. that the SS-:~ was a liquid-fuelled missilc requiring radar guidance.
The SS-4 had inertial guidance and storable propellant; the absence of fuel tankers and radar equipment was an indicator that the SS4 was being deployed, see May and Zelikow, The Kl'llnpd)' Tajles.
