The background to the crisis was the establishment in Cuba of a revolutionary government led by Fidel Castro.
Castro's left wing policies led to conflict with the United States and alliance with the Soviet Union.
In April 1961, the United States backed an invasion of Cuba by anti-Castro Cuban exiles.
However, the United States was expected to try again.Castro asked Soviet leader Khrushchev to provide forces to defend Cuba.
The Soviet Union knew the the United States not only had far more long-range missiles but also had shorter range missiles stationed close to the Soviet border in Turkey.
By installing its own nuclear missiles in Cuba, the Soviet Union could defend the Cuban revolutionaries and redress the nuclear balance.Using photographs taken by a U2 spy-plane, the United States discovered that Soviet missile bases were being established in Cuba.
After a week of intense debate within the United States leadership, on October 22, 1962, President Kennedy made a public statement revealing the existence the missile bases and calling for the missiles' immediate withdrawal.
He announced a naval blockade of Cuba to stop delivery of any further Soviet military supplies.Last-Minute SolutionFortunately, both Kennedy and Khrushchev wanted to avoid a nuclear war.
The two sides came perilously close to conflict at sea, and one United States aircraft was shot down over Cuba but in private a face-saving solution was found.
The Soviet Union would withdraw its missiles from Cuba; the United States would promise not to invade Cuba and would withdraw missiles from Turkey.After the missile crisis, a ""hotline"" was set up for emergency communication between the White House and the Kremlin.
Khrushchev was harshly criticized within the Soviet leadership for having taken such risks.
