Almost one-half century ago a series of events occurred, which came as close to causing a nuclear war between the United States of America and the Soviet Union than at any other time since the end of WWII and probably right up to the present.
Our president at the time was John F Kennedy and the Soviet leader was Nikita Khrushchev.
Kennedy had taken office in 1961 and was immediately faced with a crucial decision concerning what was to become an abortive attempt to invade Cuba, and which ultimately led to debacle on the beaches of Cuba.
The relations between the United States and Cuba, never to clubby since Fidel Castro had taken over, worsened.
As the warm summer days of 1962 segued into the cool early fall, the situation between the United States and the U.S.S.R. began heating up.
What occurred between early September and November will forever be remembered as the moment in time when the two powers came close to a nuclear war.
In early September 1962, Mr Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would be providing arms and personnel to Cuba for defensive purposes.
However, in October, a USAF reconnaissance aircraft flying over Cuba took photos that revealed that the Soviets were installing offensive ballistic missile sites in Cuba which would have the capability of reaching major cities of the United States Additionally, other United States military aircraft, flying over the Atlantic to the east of Cuba, had sighted Soviet vessels loaded with military hardware steaming towards Cuba.
The missiles already in place plus the cargo ships heading toward Cuba constituted an unacceptable threat to the United States and required immediate action by the administration.
President Kennedy and his advisers discussed a number of options, all of which contained elements of dire consequences, no matter the outcome.
