Cuba Almost Became a Nuclear Power in 1962 The scariest moment in history was even scarier than we thought.
By Svetlana Savranskaya Sergo Mikoyan Collection, National Security Archive.
October 10, 2012, 10:40 PM Cuba would have become the first nuclear power in Latin America 50 years ago, if not for the dynamics captured in this remarkable verbatim transcript -published here for the first time -of Fidel Castro's excruciating meeting with Soviet deputy prime minister Anastas Mikoyan, on November 22, 1962.
The final straw apparently came on November 20, when Castro sent instructions to Cuba’s representative at the United Nations, Carlos Lechuga, to mention “we have tactical nuclear weapons, which we should keep” — partly as leverage in negotiations over inspections, also to establish the fact that the weapons were in Cuban possession.
Even with the pullout of the strategic missiles, the tacticals would stay, and Soviet documentation reveals the intention of training the Cubans to use them.\r\n\r\nBut Fidel Castro was livid.
Anastas Mikoyan.\r\n\r\nMikoyan arrived in Cuba on November 2, 1962, and over 20 days of often-bitter conversations with Cuban leaders -culminating in this tense meeting -Mikoyan began to appreciate the danger tactical nuclear weapons posed if they were left on the island, especially in Cuban hands.
On one day, Castro would refuse to see Mikoyan; on another, Fidel would order his anti-aircraft crews to shoot at the American surveillance planes.\r\n\r\nThe final straw apparently came on November 20, when Castro sent instructions to Cuba's representative at the United Nations, Carlos Lechuga, to mention \""we have tactical nuclear weapons, which we should keep\"" -partly as leverage in negotiations over inspections, also to establish the fact that the weapons were in Cuban possession.
Mikoyan had to break this unpleasant news to his hosts, and he had to do it in such a way that they would remain Soviet allies.\r\n\r\nThis four-hour conversation on November 22 provided the final blow to the Cuban revolutionaries, now that the Soviet Union was removing all the weapons for which Cuba had to suffer so much.
He went back to the initial offer of missiles and stated that the Cubans did not want the missiles, they only accepted the weapons as part of \""fulfilling their duty to the socialist camp.
We tried to help the Soviet Union to get out of a difficult situation.\""\r\n\r\nIn desperation, Castro almost begged Mikoyan to leave the tactical warheads in Cuba, especially because the Americans were not aware of them and they were not part of the agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev.
It is our right .\""\r\n\r\nThis ended Cuba's hope to become a Latin American nuclear power.\r\n\r\nIronically, if the Cubans were a little more pliant, and a little less independent, if they were more willing to be Soviet pawns, they would have kept the tactical nuclear weapons on the island.
