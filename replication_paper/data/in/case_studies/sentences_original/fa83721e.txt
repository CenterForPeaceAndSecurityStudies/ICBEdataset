The Agricultural Revolution Farming developed in a number of different parts of the ancient world, before the beginning of recorded history.
That means it’s very difficult for historians to describe early agricultural societies in as much detail as we’d like.
Also, because there are none of the written records historians typically use to understand the past, we rely to a much greater extent on archaeologists, anthropologists, and other specialists for the data that informs our histories.
And because the science supporting these fields has advanced rapidly in recent years, our understanding of this prehistoric period has also changed — sometimes abruptly.
Farming was once believed to have developed in the Middle East at sites such as Jericho and Mesopotamia six or seven thousand years ago, where the ancestors of modern Europeans were usually credited with the invention of agriculture.
More recently, responding to evidence of prehistoric farming in Africa, India, and China, some scholars suggested agriculture may have developed more or less independently in several regions of the world.
But it was difficult to imagine how such parallel development could have occurred, with people in different parts of the world not only making the same basic discoveries but making them pretty much simultaneously.
Even more recently, scientists have begun to suspect this confusion may reflect the difficulty of finding archaeological evidence, since plant materials decay in the ground much more quickly than arrowheads and stone spear points.
And some have suggested we may have been thinking about agriculture wrong.
It now seems likely that agriculture began in a very gradual process that goes back much farther than we had imagined.
Humans as a species began in southern Africa some 300,000 years ago and after a population crisis about 150,000 years ago, modern humans seem to have left Africa between 80,000 and 100,000 years ago.
In the early millennia of their spread across the connected continents of Africa, Europe, and Asia, modern humans lived mobile lives as hunter-gatherers.
According to archaeologists, many left traces of their presence in the area north of the Black Sea from about 80,000 to about 50,000 years ago.
Although they may have favored certain locations for long periods of time, ancient people were forced to follow the herds they hunted and to seek new food sources when conditions changed.
Climate changed very slowly, but the cycle of glaciation was a factor in human development; especially the most recent ice age which began about 36,000 years ago and lasted until about 11,000 years ago.
This ice age displaced both animal and human populations, and also allowed some people to migrate to the Americas, as we will see.
At some point, people discovered that seeds dropped into rubbish heaps sprouted into new plants.
People probably began planting or transplanting their favorites closer to home, so they would not always have to go far, looking for food.
This horticulture or part-time farming may have begun before these ancient humans began to spread from the Black Sea area westward into Europe and east into Asia, which would explain the seemingly coincidental parallel development of farming across much of the globe.
Various regions may have each developed their distinctive versions of what we now recognize as agriculture from a deep pool of common techniques.
Wheat was discovered in a region we call the fertile crescent, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean.
As cultivation spread and surpluses of grain were produced, civilizations like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia rose between 6,000 and 5,000 years ago.
About the same time residents of the Pearl River estuary in what is now China began cultivating rice in flooded fields called paddies.
The three other staple crops of the modern world were developed between 9,000 and 7,000 years ago by natives of the Americas, as we will discuss below.
The transition from nomadic hunt-and-gather groups to more complex societies based on agriculture (and the specialization and segmentation of work) allowed for the development of sedentary cultures which _ established governments, writing and number systems, and _ hierarchal social systems able to build impressive structures, defend (and sometimes expand) their borders, and create art and music.
Let’s look briefly at the ancient societies of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas to prepare for our coverage of them in the early modern period in the opening chapters.
Ancient Kingdoms of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean The ancient dynasties of the Egyptian empire developed along the Nile beginning around 3100 BCE, built on the wheat surpluses made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile River.
Among the most visible and lasting achievements of the Egyptian empires are the pyramids of Giza, built between 2600-2400 BCE to serve as burial tombs for several emperors.
The societies of ancient Greece, particularly in Athens, directly influenced culture and intellectual life in Europe and the Middle East to the present day.
Greek dramas and tragedies continue to be studied and performed; Pythagoras’ mathematical discoveries are still taught in schools; and the thinking of 6 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are the basis for Western philosophy and political science today.
Greek ideas and culture were adopted by the Romans and _ spread throughout their empire—indeed, many Greek gods became Roman gods under different names.
The Romans spread their language and their Latin alphabet to western Europe in particular.
The Hebrew prophet Moses, influenced by spiritual ideas from the various societies, developed the concept of only one god for his people.
Moses’ monotheism was an unusual innovation in an era when most societies worshipped several gods and many honored the gods of other cultures.
The Ten Commandments and the laws and regulations attributed to Moses in the Torah not only formed the basis of Judaism, but also Christianity and later Islam—all religions which only worship a single god.
Shortly after the Romans conquered the region of Israel, Jesus of Nazareth, a Jewish thinker, began preaching a new more peaceful and inclusive religion of salvation.
His followers, led especially by Paul (said to have never met Jesus), preached that Jesus was the Son of God and invited Gentiles to join the faith.
The new religion was especially embraced by slaves in the Roman Empire who were attracted to the promise of forgiveness, of a single, all-powerful God’s unending love, and of eternal life after death.
The Romans, who saw the new religion as a challenge to state religious authority, sometimes persecuted Christians.
Because Constantine embraced the new faith, the Roman Catholic Church is the most direct descendent of the Roman Empire.
The Pope, leader of the Catholic Church, still lives in Rome, and the vestments of Catholic priests (and the clergy of some other liturgical Christian denominations) are similar to those worn by fourthcentury Roman officials.
Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople, was a powerful fortress controlling the Bosphorus Strait which connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
The city of Byzantium, already a thousand years old when Constantine moved there, served as the eastern administrative center of the empire and continued using Greek, rather than Latin, as its official language.
A somewhat separate Christian church developed in this Greek part of the empire, based on the idea that the different archbishops controlled spiritual matters as a group, and that the Pope in Rome was only another archbishop, equal to the others.
After 1000 CE, Catholics in the west and the Greek Orthodox in the east split from one another.
During the fifth century CE, Germanic tribes from northern Europe invaded the Roman Empire.
They, in turn, were fleeing from Attila the Hun and other invaders from Asia.
But although the empire had ended the Roman Catholic Church remained strong.
The Church preserved much of the culture of the Roman Modern World History 9 Empire, including its language, Latin, which was used in liturgies and ceremonies until 1965.
Germanic languages were transformed through their contact with Latin speakers.
The English language is a good example of both Germanic and Latin influences.
The remaining months are ordinal numbers seven through ten—although in a confusing change, the Catholic Church decided to begin the calendar in January, making “December” the twelfth month instead of the tenth.
Saturday, Sunday, and Monday come from the sacred Roman orbs in the sky—Spanish, French and other more Latin languages continue in this vein for the other four days, but not English, which honors the barbarian gods Tieu, Woden, Thor, and Frija for the remainder of the week.
The Eastern Roman Empire lasted for nearly another 1000 years after the fall of Rome.
You can tell which 10 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford European peoples were converted by Catholic missionaries and which were proselytized by Orthodox preachers by looking at their alphabets—Russia, the Ukraine, and Bulgaria, for example, use the Greek-based “Cyrillic” alphabet, while all western European languages use a version of the Latin alphabet.
The Prophet’s teachings, later gathered in the Holy Quran, built upon Judaism and Christianity.
Mecca itself was long a site of religious pilgrimage honoring the Hebrew patriarch Abraham, and Jesus is considered as an important prophet in Islam.
By the time of Muhammad’s passing in 632, Islam was well-established in the eastern Arabian Peninsula; within the next one hundred years, it became the dominant religion in North Africa, the Middle East, and Persia.
By 1200, Muslim rulers also dominated South Asia and the Iberian Peninsula.
Modern World History 11 Islam brought stability to the region and _ trade, learning, and the exchange of ideas flourished.
The extent of Muslim trade is notable in the establishment of a center of Islamic study in Timbuktu in the middle of northern Sub-Saharan Africa, located across the Sahara Desert from Mecca in today’s Mali.
Indeed, the nation with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia, is a South East Asian archipelago located An 18th-century map of Mecca, showing the Al-Haram Mosque and the Ka’bah, i which millions of Muslims visit on thousands of miles from the pilgrimages every year.
Arabian Peninsula; Arab traders first introduced their religion there in the 1200s.
The Arab world benefitted from relatively stable administrations and commercial links that allowed merchants to bring new technology, science, and mathematics from India and China to the region, which Arab scholars refined in their own centers of learning.
Muslims, like Christians, Jews, and followers of all other world religions, may share common sacred writings and liturgical traditions, but are also divided by different theological interpretations and religious practices.
Sunnis, 90% of Muslims today, stem from the group who believed in the latter, while Shi'ites, some 10% of all Muslims, include the descendants of the Prophet as early principle imams of Islam.
As will be discussed later, the rulers of Persia—today’s Iran—embraced Shi’ism, while most of their neighbors are Sunni.
Asia After thousands of years of hunting and gathering, the ancient people of northern China began cultivating millet and rice at about the same time and in much the same way that people of the Middle East grew wheat and people of the Americas grew maize, potatoes, and cassava.
China’s recorded history began about 2000 BCE, or over four thousand years ago, so historians have a pretty good idea what happened there in the distant past.
Based on irrigated rice agriculture, the population of China grew to 50 to 60 million people as early as 2,000 years ago.
This population was originally divided into several small kingdoms whose ruling families were connected through political marriages.
This empire lasted over two thousand years under a series of over a dozen dynasties until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the establishment of the Republic of China.
In the region that is now Pakistan and India, Indus Valley cities such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, which reached their maturity by about 2600 BCE, each housed 30,000 to 60,000 people.
These cultures grew on an agricultural base focused on wheat, barley, and millet.
The permanent nature of sedentary agricultural societies led thinkers to consider in more complex ways how people Modern World History 13 should live correctly in the world, which led to the establishment of both religious and civil structures that are the ancestors and sources of many of the world governments and religions which still exist today.
During the Vedic period in India, Hinduism took root beginning around 2000 BCE, based on stories of gods and goddesses, and their relationships with one another and the world.
Buddhist ideas inspired the spiritual aspects of Chinese, Japanese, and Southeast Asian thought.
The earliest emperors of China began large public works programs including construction of what they called Long Walls which later formed the basis of the Great Wall, partly to protect from northern tribes and partly to expand their territory northward.
Artifacts from the Roman Empire have been found in China and silk (which China developed before 3000 BCE) became a luxury fabric in Greece and Rome.
The canal allowed rice, wheat, and millet to be 14 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford transported on a protected inland waterway instead of being shipped on the ocean where shipments could be threatened by pirates.
The Isolated Americas The people living in the Americas were separated by climate change from Eurasia for nearly 12,000 years after the end of the ice age that had created Beringia between what is now Alaska and Siberia, and allowed Eurasians to cross over into the Americas.
During this period, which we should remember is twice as long as recorded history, the Native Americans were not idle.
When they had arrived in the Americas, they found very few large animal species available to domesticate.
Like the Europeans, Asians, and Africans, Native Americans experienced their own agricultural revolution after a long period of hunting and gathering; but instead of domesticating cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens, Americans developed certain plants, creating three of the world’s current top five staple crops.
An image depicting Teosinte, a Maize-teosinte hybrid, and Maize, developed 7,000 to 10,000 years ago in central Mexico.
Staple crops produce the foods that provide the greatest percentage of the calories people eat.
It might surprise you that today only about fifteen staple crops account for 90% of the calories people eat every day.
The top five are responsible for nearly three quarters, including feed for the animals whose meat we eat.
They were all discovered/invented by ancient people between six and ten thousand years ago, and three of the five were invented in the Americas.
The world’s five top five staples today are maize , rice, wheat, potatoes, and cassava.
Only rice and wheat were known to Europe, Asia, and Africa before contact with the Americas.
Natives of what is now Mexico developed maize from a native grass called teosinte beginning about nine thousand years ago, and its use spread to nearly every part of the Americas.
Over generations, women selectively bred the grass to produce more and bigger seeds.
Maize is currently the most important staple in the world for both human and animal feed, as well as in industrial uses like High Fructose Corn Syrup, plastics and fuel.
Andean natives in what is now Peru and Bolivia created many varieties of potatoes beginning 10,000 years ago.
Andean women developed different varieties for different growing conditions and learned to freeze dry potatoes for long-term storage.
And the people of the Amazon region not only discovered manioc trees growing in the rainforest, but developed processes to turn the trees’ poisonous roots into cassava between 10,000 and 16 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford 7,000 years ago.
So in addition to domesticating the plant, Amazonian tree farmers had to develop technologies (combinations of boiling, drying, and chemical leaching) to remove the cyanide compounds and make the manioc useful.
Along with rice and wheat developed in Eurasia, maize, potatoes, and manioc are the most important staple crops in the modern world, feeding billions of people.
Cassava roots need to be processed to remove poisons before they can be eaten.
Of course, eating nothing but maize, potatoes, and cassava would be a very bland diet.
The Meso-Americans also ground cocoa beans and added hot water, peppers, and honey to make hot chocolate—even today, millions of Latin Americans begin and end their day with a cup, prepared in a traditional o//eta with a hand-held batidor, using chunks of chocolate.
However, such a delicious drink was originally reserved for the nobility, and cocoa beans themselves were often used as a kind of currency.
We will look more closely in the next several chapters at the cultures of all these regions, as they entered the modern era.
Although the people of each continent and region developed different traditions and customs, their agriculturally-based cultures shared a lot of similarities and their civilizations were all comparably advanced at the beginning of our survey. with that introduction, let’s begin.
This may surprise many who grew up believing that most of the important events of modern history happened in the West.
Don't worry, we'll add Europe, Africa, and the Americas to the story soon enough.
But before we do that, it’s important to understand that the histories of China and India are as old as western history if not older, and Asia has always been the center of world population.
China held a monopoly on _ the creation of silk, which was a closelyheld state secret for millennia, and led the world in iron, copper, and porcelain production as well as a variety of technological inventions including the compass, gunpowder, paper-making, mechanical clocks, and moveable type printing.
The social stability that allowed Chinese culture to produce Modern World History 21 these innovations was based on not only the imperial form of government, but on an elaborate system of professional civil service.
The early establishment of a professional administrative class of “scholar-officials” was a remarkable element of imperial Chinese rule that made it more stable, longer-lasting, and at least potentially less oppressive than empires in other parts of the world.
The imperial courts sent thousands of highly-educated administrators throughout the empire and China was ruled not by hereditary nobles or even elected representatives, but by a class of men who had received rigorous training and had passed very stringent examinations to prove themselves qualified to lead.
Young men who wanted to become civil administrators in China entered training schools that concentrated on calligraphy and the teachings of Confucius.
Chinese language is based on characters rather than on an alphabet, and is said to be the world’s oldest continually-used writing system.
A dictionary published in 1039 CE listed 53,525 characters, and a 2004 Chinese dictionary included 106,230.
For comparison, the English alphabet uses 26 letters and the average American has a practical vocabulary of about 10,000 words.
Kong Fuzi (Master _ Kong—he is’ known as — “Confucius” in the West) taught principles derived from what he described as old Chinese classics.
Confucius was drawn nearly twothousand IW a culture devoted to years after his death. reverence of its ancestors.
He traveled as a teacher and advisor of local rulers, and his practical philosophy spread.
The Chinese, who valued silver higher than gold, called this the silver rule.
Confucian social morality is based on this reciprocity and on empathy and understanding others rather than on divinely ordained rules.
Although Confucius occasionally talked about heaven and an afterlife, his moral system was not based on the idea of supernatural rewards and punishments.
Confucian morality is secular rather than religious, which left room for the Emperor to be a representative of Divinity and claim “the Mandate of Heaven” without the Chinese Empire becoming a theocracy.
Modern World History 23 Ming Dynasty painting of the highest-level Confucian examination at the imperial palace.
Centuries after his death, Confucian ideas became the basis of civil service education in imperial China.
Scholars would travel to testing centers and sit for exams that often took days to complete.
They brought food and a bedroll and remained in their small testing cells until they had completed the exam.
The highest exam was administered by the emperor himself and passing it qualified a scholar for assignments in the imperial court.
The exams were extremely difficult and at each level more people failed than passed.
Over the centuries, the scholars became an upper class in Chinese society, a gentry based on educational merit rather than merely on birth or wealth.
Although there were times when the system was corrupted, for most of its history Chinese society was run by 24 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford educated men rather than by nobles who had inherited their positions.
Confucianism is not a perfect philosophy, since it accepted and even reinforced certain societal injustices.
Confucius incorporated traditional Chinese ancestorworship into his system, which implied a degree of sacredness for ancestral practices.
For this reason, Confucian principles perpetuated and exacerbated the oppression of women, who had no standing in the male-dominated family structure.
Percale Although several Beier governments tried to eliminate footbinding, the practice infanticide has been a persisted in China until the Communist problem throughout Chinese Revolution in 1949.
These girls were among history, as was, until the last se to have their feet bound in the Si century, the practice of footbinding, which rendered generations of Chinese women crippled and semi-mobile for the sake of what amounted to a fetish of Chinese fashion.
The Confucian civil service was a central feature of Chinese imperial culture for centuries.
This time-lapse map of the Mongol Empire shows the expansion of the Khanate after Genghis Khan's 1227 death.
The Chinese Empire did face conquest several times, but Chinese culture and social organization managed to absorb its conquerors.
In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, defeated the Chinese army and established the Yuan dynasty, which that lasted 98 years until 1868.
Although Kublai Khan never completely conquered 26 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford China despite 65 years of struggle, Yuan rule marked the first time the Chinese Empire was controlled by foreigners.
The Khan distrusted Confucian officials, but he did not completely replace them as regional administrators.
Still, through the Yuan dynasty, China was exposed to foreign cultures, especially Islamic cartography, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, food, and clothing, while likewise, the West encountered Chinese culture and technological advances in a serious way.
The Mongol rulers also patronized China’s new printing industry, which helped spread the idea of moveable type printing into Europe.
Along ‘| with exposure to foreign cultures, the Mongols’ reopening of the Silk Road brought foreign diseases to _ China.
Bubonic Plague, the “Black Death” that killed a quarter of the European An illustrated page from the 1298 Travels of Marco Polo depicts Kublai Khan battling population ee the 14th the King of Burma with elephants. century, actually hit China first.
The plague began in central Kyrgystan and killed up to 25 million people in China in the 1880s and 1840s, about 15 years before it first arrived in Constantinople.
As in Europe, famine and social chaos followed Modern World History 27 the plague when agriculture failed to produce enough to feed the survivors.
A young man named Zhu Yuanzhang, born during the plague years, watched his entire family die in famines that swept through southern China in the 1340s.
After taking refuge in a Buddhist monastery, Zhu joined local rebels when the monastery was destroyed by Yuan forces trying to contain a local insurrection.
Zhu joined forces with a rebel army called the Red Turbans and rose quickly through the ranks.
Zhu married the daughter of the founder of the Red Turbans and inherited his leadership position after eliminating several rival generals.
In 1356, the 28-year old general conquered the ancient city of Nanjing and made it his base.
The Mongols retreated to Mongolia and Zhu claimed the Mandate of Heaven and declared himself the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty.
Imperial titles like “Hongwu” relate to the reign of each emperor, in which they declare the nature of their particular rule.
These titles are not the actual name of the emperor, but this is how they are known in Chinese history.
Hongwu ruled for thirty years and tried to return the empire to its ethnic Chinese roots.
Hongwu issued decrees abolishing Mongol dress and requiring people to abandon Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor, their Mongol-influenced reigned from 1368 to 1398. names in favor of traditional Han Chinese names.
Administration of the empire by Confucian scholars was reinstated, along with the elaborate system of civil service examinations.
Remembering the suffering and famines during his youth, partly caused by the flooding of the Yangtze River, Hongwu promoted public works and infrastructure projects including new dikes and irrigation systems to serve an agricultural system dominated by paddy rice.
He organized the building or repair of nearly 41,000 reservoirs and planted over a billion trees in his land reclamation program.
Hongwu distributed land to peasants and forced many to move to less populated areas.
Modern World History 29 Hongwu had fought his way to prominence by eliminating his rivals and trusting only his family.
His uncle Zhu Di, the emperor’s younger son, had been passed Statue of Zhu Di, the Yongle Emperor, athis over for the crown but ema Ar BeIINe, remained prince of a northern territory around Dadu, the previous Yuan capital close to the Mongol border.
In 1402 Zhu Di overthrew his nephew and declared himself the Yongle Emperor.
Yongle tried to erase the memory of his rebellion by purging a large number of Confucian scholars in the capital of Nanjing and moving the government to his home in Dadu, which he renamed Beijing.
Yongle ruled through an extensive network of court eunuchs who formed his palace guard and secret police.
Yongle repaired and reopened China’s Grand Canal, the 1,104-mile waterway that linked the Yellow and Yangxi Rivers and enabled the new capital to receive rice shipments from the south.
Between 1406 and 1420, he also directed 100,000 artisans and | million laborers in building the Forbidden City in Beijing as a permanent imperial residence.
At the age of ten Zheng He was captured, castrated, and sent to serve Prince Zhu Di in Dadu.
Castration was a common practice throughout the ancient and early modern world, used in China to insure loyalty by eliminating conflict between family and duty.
Educated in the prince’s household, Zheng He became a loyal soldier and later a general.
Zheng He helped Zhu Di depose his nephew Statue of Admiral Zheng He located in Melaka, Malaysia. and take control of the empire, and the new Yongle Emperor appointed Zheng He admiral of his fleet and sent him on seven expeditions between 1405 and 1430.
Modern World History 31 Zheng He's flagship compared to the caravel Santa Maria used by Columbus 87 years later.
China’s four-decked, 1,500-ton flagships had shallow drafts to allow them to navigate in river estuaries and watertight bulkheads to protect them from sinking.
Their nine masts were up to two hundred feet tall and fitted with rattan sails.
Zheng He’s fleet was not interested in establishing colonies, but in exacting tribute and opening trade relationships throughout South Asia.
The fleet traded for ivory, spices, ointments, exotic woods, giraffes, zebras, and ostriches; while also demanding tribute from the rulers of nations like Sumatra and Sri Lanka.
Often, when local leaders seemed unwilling to submit, Zheng He seized them and brought them to Beijing where they could be convinced of the overwhelming power of the Chinese Empire.
Among the places Zheng visited were Bangkok, Java, Melaka, Burma, the east and west coasts of India, 32 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, Jedda on the Red Sea, and Mogadishu and Mombasa on the east coast of Africa.
Ninetyfive delegations from Southeast Asia and other more distant nations reached the Yongle Emperor’s court during his 22-year reign, and he established a College of Translators to handle all the correspondence he received from foreign contacts.
Zheng He’s seven expeditions extracted tribute from many neighboring kingdoms, and Yongle trusted him so completely that he sent Zheng He blank scrolls with his imperial seal on them, to use in whatever way he chose.
For many centuries the voyages of Zheng He were not featured in histories of China, even in China itself.
As historians have rediscovered these expeditions, the superiority of Chinese naval technology has challenged the belief that western nations were the first to establish maritime power.
China did not establish offshore colonies, perhaps partly because there was so much territory available on the empire’s northern and western frontiers.
China’s rapidlygrowing population was a ready market for most of the empire’s Modern World History 33 farm products and manufactures, and the international trade that interested China already found its way to the empire without much effort on China’s part.
And unlike European kings, the Yongle emperor was not interested in evangelizing Confucianism or Buddhism to the rest of the world—the Spanish and Portuguese, in particular, wanted to convert the world to Catholic Christianity, which became not only a goal but a justification for conquest and colonization.
When the Yongle Emperor’s son and grandson inherited the throne, Zheng He’s expeditions gradually became less of a priority.
After a final voyage in 1433, expeditions were halted and the fleet was retired and ultimately burned.
Ending China’s navy was one of the major changes made by Yongle’s descendants.
The burning of the Chinese fleet left a power vacuum in the South China Sea, which in the sixteenth century was filled by Japanese and Chinese coastal pirates.
Finally, shortly after Yongle and Zheng He’s deaths, China was challenged from the north again.
The Long Walls had existed since the beginning of the Chinese Empire, but had failed to hold off Mongol invaders.
Under the Mings the Great Wall was improved and extended, especially around the capital of Beijing and the agricultural heartland in the Liaodong Province north of the Korean Peninsula.
However, the threat of a Manchurian land invasion from the north was taken very seriously, to the detriment of authorizing further naval expeditions.
China’s turning away from the ocean was a momentous decision in world history, opening the door for Southeast Asians, Muslims, and eventually Europeans to dominate the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.
Modern World History 35 As the generations passed, Ming emperors and_ their courts became increasingly isolated in the Forbidden City the Yongle Emperor had built.
Similar to other new imperial dynasties, the Ming Dynasty began by concentrating political power in the Emperor and in the civil servants chosen through the Confucian examination process.
As time passed, a ruling class grew and power The Forbidden City as depicted in 1500. shifted as the new elite protected their lands and possessions from taxation.
Corrupt officials siphoned funds designated for public works into their own pockets and infrastructure such as dams and dikes crumbled.
Eventually, irrigation systems failed and peasants died in widespread famines.
At the same time, Manchuria was being unified under strong military leaders who had adopted Chinese ways and who even employed Confucian administrators.
In 1644, a Ming government official dealing with a local peasant insurrection that threatened Beijing asked the Manchurians for military aid.
Of course, once the Manchu armies were past the Wall, there was no way to send them back.
For now, the point of beginning modern’ world history with China is that in terms of population and economic power, it was the center of the world in 1500 when our survey of Modern World History begins.
In 1500, the Chinese population was growing rapidly, the Ming Empire had a standing army of over a _ million soldiers and the Chinese navy of Zheng He had recently Qing emperor Qianlong in ceremonial projected the empire’s power Manchurian armor, ca.58. throughout Asia.
The Chinese economy produced one quarter of the world’s gross domestic product in 1500, followed by India which produced nearly another quarter.
In comparison, the fourteen nations of western Europe produced just about half of China’s GDP or only one-eight of the global total production.
The largest European economy, in Italy, produced only about one-sixth of China’s output.
Keep the immense mass of China and the gravity exerted by its economy in mind as we move on to discuss events like the creation of a Spanish colonial empire in the Americas—Spanish-American mines produced the silver that accidentally became the world’s currency, filling not only the treasuries Europe, but also that of China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Modern World History 37 Questions for Discussion Discuss the symbolism of the Great Wall in Chinese culture.
The teachings of Kong Fuzi (Master Kong—known_ as “Confucius” in the West) were the basis of regulating relationships in Chinese society.
For centuries, Painting of Confucius discovered would-be civil servants recently in a Western Han tomb, needed to study Confucian dated approx.
BCE to 9 CE. precepts for the examinations used to choose imperial administrators.
Drawing on ancient Chinese customs of patriarchy, filial piety, and veneration of ancestors, Confucianism was extremely chauvinistic and led to centuries of oppression of women in Chinese culture-when Confucius said “man” or “he”, he actually meant it.
However, that doesn’t mean Confucius didn't make some thought-provoking statements, if we expand them to include all people.
When a person shouldn't be spoken with and you speak to them, you waste your breath.
They contain a wealth of information about Ming China, including twenty-two references to Chinese Admiral Zheng He and his diplomatic voyages, dated from July 1405 to March 1431.
Here are some entries, describing Zheng He's missions and incidents related to them.
In several, Zheng is described as being sent as an emissary to fan countries.
The Mandarin word fan translates roughly as ordinary or mortal, suggesting the attitude of the Chinese emperors toward 44 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford foreign nations and their rulers.
Year 3, Month 6, Day 15 “The Eunuch Director Zheng He who had been sent to the various countries of the Western Ocean, returned, bringing the pirate Chen Zuyi and others in fetters.
Previously, when he had arrived at Old Port, he came across Zuyi and so on and sent people to bring them to negotiated pacification.
Zuyi and the others feigned surrender but secretly plotted to attack the Imperial army.
He and the others found out about this and, marshalling the troops, prepared defenses.
When the forces led by Zuyi attacked, He sent his troops out to do battle.
Over 5,000 of the bandit gang were killed, while ten of the bandit ships were burnt and seven captured.
Further, two false bronze seals were seized and three prisoners, including Zuyi, were taken alive.
Year 5, Month 9, Day 2 “The eunuch Zheng He and others, who had been sent as envoys to the various countries in the Western Ocean, returned and presented Yalie Kunaier, the captured king of the country of Sri Lanka, and his family members.
Previously, He and the others had been sent as envoys to the various fan countries.
However, when they reached Sri Lanka, Yalie Kunaier was insulting and disrespectful.
Yalie Kunaier also acted in an unfriendly way to neighboring countries and Modern World History 45 repeatedly intercepted and robbed their envoys.
When He returned, he again passed Sri Lanka and the king enticed him to the country.
The king then had his son Nayan demand gold, silver and precious objects, but He would not give these to him.
The king then secretly dispatched over 50,000 fan troops to rob He's ships.
They also felled trees to create obstructions and impede He's route of return, so that he could not render assistance.
He and the others found out about this and they gathered their force and set off back to their ships.
Thus, he secretly ordered persons to go to the ships by another route with orders that the government troops were to fight to the death in opposing the attackers.
He then personally led 2,000 of his troops through a by-path and attacked the royal city by surprise.
They took the city and captured alive Yalie Kunaier, his family members and chieftains.
The fan army returned and surrounded the city and several battles were fought, but He greatly defeated them.
The Emperor pitied the king for his stupidity and ignorance and leniently ordered that he and the others be released and given food and clothing.
Year 9, Month 6, Day 16 “As the envoys from the various countries of Calicut, Java, Melaka, Champa, Sri Lanka, Mogadishu, Liushan, Nanboli, Bulawa, Aden, Samudera, Malin, Lasa, Hormuz, Cochin, Nanwuli, Shaliwanni and Pahang, as well as from the Old Port Pacification Superintendency, were departing to return home, suits of clothing made from patterned fine silks were conferred upon all of them.
Everything which is covered and contained has been placed in the charge of the Moulder, who manifests the benevolence of the Creator.
The world does not have two ultimate principles and people do not have two hearts.
They are sorrowful or happy in the same way and have the same feelings and desires.
One who is outstanding in ruling the people should do his best to treat the people as his children.
Those who respond to the influences and move towards culture are not singular.
The country of Cochin is far away in the South-west, on the shore of the vast ocean, further distant than the other fan countries.
It has long inclined towards Chinese culture and been accepting of civilizing influences.
When the Imperial orders arrived, the people there went down on their hands and knees and were greatly excited.
For the last several years, the country has had fertile soil, and the people have had houses in which to live, enough fish and turtles to eat, and enough cloth and silk to make clothes.
Parents have looked after their children and the young have respected their elders.
In the mountains no savage beasts have appeared and in the streams no noxious fishes have been seen.
The sea has brought forth treasures and the forests have produced excellent woods.
Everything has been in bountiful supply, several times more bountiful than in ordinary times.
There have been no destructive winds, and damaging rains have not occurred.
This is all indeed the result of the civilizing influences of the Sage.’ | possess but slight virtuous power.
An engraved tablet is to be erected on this mountain to record these facts forever.
Year 14, Month 12, Day 10 “The envoys from the 16 countries of Hormuz and so on departed on their return to their countries.
In addition, the Eunuch Director Zheng He and others were sent with Imperial orders, together with brocades, fine silks, silk gauzes, 48 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford damasks and thin silks to confer upon the kings of these countries.
Year 19, Month 1, Day 30 “The Eunuch Director Zheng He and others were sent with an Imperial proclamation to go and instruct the various fan countries.
You, the various fan countries far across the ocean, will not yet have heard.
Now | am especially sending the Eunuch Directors Zheng He and Wang Jinghong carrying this proclamation with which to instruct you.
You must all respect and accord with the Way of Heaven, care for your people and keep them in peace.
Variegated silks, as appropriate, were to be conferred upon the rulers or chiefs of all 20 countries through which the eunuchs were to pass, including Hormuz, Sri Lanka, Calicut, Melaka, Cochin, Bulawa, Mogadishu, Nanboli, Samudera, Lasa, Liushan, Aru, Ganbali, Aden, Zuofaer, Zhubu, Jiayile and so on, as well as the Old Port Pacification Superintendency.
Year 5, Month 6, Day 9 “The chieftain Wubaochina and others from the country of Melaka, arrived at the Court.
They advised that the king of their country wanted to personally come to Court and offer tribute, but that he had been obstructed by the king of the country of Siam.
They also said that Siam had long wanted to invade their country and that their country wanted to memorialize but had had no one who could write the memorial.
At this time, the king had ordered that these three ministers secretly attach themselves to a Samuderan tribute ship and come to Court.
They requested that the Court send Modern World History 49 people to instruct the king of Siam to no longer oppress or mistreat their country and that thereby they would be unendingly grateful for the Court's grace.
The Emperor ordered the Auxiliary Ministry of Rites to confer rewards upon Wubaochina and the others and to send them back to their country with the ships of the eunuch director Zheng He.
You have been able to respect the Court and have repeatedly sent envoys to come to Court and offer tribute. | am pleased with your service.
However, recently, it has been heard that the king of the country of Melaka wanted to personally come to Court, but was obstructed by you.
Rather, it must have been some of your attendants, who are unable to think deeply about things, who have obstructed avenues and started strife with neighboring states.
You, king should respect my orders, develop good relations with your neighbors, examine and instruct your subordinates and not act recklessly or aggressively.
Then it will be seen that you are able to respect Heaven and serve the superior, protect the country and the people's peace and maintain good relations with neighboring states.
Accordingly, ramie-silk clothing, biao-li of variegated silks, silks and cotton cloth were conferred upon him in the same quantities as those conferred upon tribute envoys from other countries.
It begins in the 14th century with the Black Death and ends with the American depopulation of the Columbian Exchange, which we'll talk about next time.
One of the major changes in Europe in the early modern period, which we take for granted today, is the beginning of a tendency toward nations rather than empires.
Europe’s nations were identified by factors like ethnicity, language, customs, and religion.
Often these nations fought neighbors that were defined by different identities.
This made European nations unlike the empires of Asia and the near east that typically included wide varieties of cultures and ethnicities within their borders.
The first, oldest, and largest Asian empire was China, as we’ve already discussed.
But there were four additional empires that set the scene for the early modern period, and whose histories helped shape the world today.
These were the Mughal Empire in India, the Safavid Empire in Persia , the Russian Empire on Europe’s eastern border, and the Ottoman Empire in the 54 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford Middle East.
The Ottomans were a Muslim dynasty that rose on the borders of the Byzantine Empire in the 1800s and became a world power when Sultan Mehmed II (called Mehmed the Conqueror) overwhelmed the defenders of Constantinople in 1453.
The city was strategically important because it controlled the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that connected the Mediterranean Sea with the Black Sea.
The Sultan allowed Christians and Jews to continue living in Istanbul and granted the Eastern Orthodox Church autonomy as long as they accepted Ottoman authority.
But many Christian refugees fled the city and found their ways to cities like Venice and Florence, where they helped ignite the period known as the Renaissance.
Ottoman Empire HB Ottoman Turks, 1300-1359 HBB Expansion under Murat tt, 1421-1451 [HBB Expansion under Mehmet it and Selim 1, 1451-1520 HBB Expansion under Suleiman the Magnificent, 1520-1566 [Ge Expansion, 1566-1683 Arabs.
Peripheral peoples — Present international boundary Istanbul quickly became the largest Eurasian city outside China.
Under Sultans like Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520-1566), the Ottomans expanded into Europe and nearly captured Vienna in 1529 and again in 1683.
They controlled shipping in the western Mediterranean and the trade routes and major markets connecting to the Silk Road such as Cairo and Baghdad.
The high cost of doing business in the Ottomancontrolled Middle East created an incentive for European Modern World History 55 merchants to seek other ways of reaching Asia.
The Ottomans were actually quite tolerant of ethnic, language, and religious diversity, and their empire was multi-ethnic and multicultural.
Local languages, religions, and even self-government were allowed as long as people remained loyal to the empire and paid their taxes.
In regions that were too poor to pay in money or produce, the Ottomans often took a tax in the form of people.
For example, young boys were taken as tribute captives from villages in the Balkans.
They were converted to Islam, educated, and trained into an elite fighting force called the Janissaries who reported directly to the Emperor.
Because they were personally loyal to one man, the Janissaries became politically powerful.
Fear that the private army would betray him and name another heir Sultan caused new rulers to assassinate all their brothers as soon as they took the throne.
The Janissaries were the Ottomans’ most effective weapon from 1868 to 1826, when the sultan decided to disband them in favor of a modern military.
The Janissaries mutinied and marched on the Sultan’s palace, but several thousand were wiped out by modern artillery and the survivors executed.
The Ottoman Empire tried to modernize in other ways as well, but fell behind its European neighbors in the nineteenth century and finally met its end during the First World War.
The Safavid Empire of Persia was a Shiite Muslim dynasty that controlled the region from the eastern border of the Ottoman Empire, through Iran, and into what is now Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, and Pakistan.
The Safavid’s greatest ruler, Shah Abbas the Great, moved his capital to Isfahan in central Iran.
Shah Abbas continued the tradition of settling refugees in Isfahan, welcoming hundreds of thousands of Armenians in the early 1600s from the disputed border region separating the Shiite Safavid Empire from the Sunni Ottoman Empire.
After the Armenian genocide in 1915, during World War One, the Armenian quarter of Isfahan became one of the oldest and largest Armenian centers in the world.
Modern World History 57 Safavid Empire 1501-1736 The maximum extent of the Safavid Empire under Shah Abbas The Mughal Empire of India was established in 1526 by a Persian-speaking dynasty that traced its authority back to Genghis Khan’s second son, Chagatai.
The empire formed in a region that had been conquered by Tamerlane, a Mongol leader who consolidated the remains of several khanates.
He died in 1405 on his way to a planned invasion of Ming China which his successor immediately called off.
Inspired by Tamerlane’s fusion of cultures and religious movements, a new religion called Sikhism developed in the Punjab in the 15thcentury by combining elements of the traditional Hinduism of the region with Islam.
Sikhs opposed India’s caste system, while becoming legendary warriors on the sub-continent.
The Mughals ruled a wealthy empire that included most of the Indian subcontinent and large parts of Afghanistan.
Hinduism, which is still the dominant religion of India, is The Taj Mahal based on ancient traditions and practices originating centuries before the development of Judaism and other religions in the Middle East.
It is a polytheistic religion in which the stories of the relations among the gods and goddesses help explain the human condition.
Unlike Muslims and Christians, differences related to religious practice have rarely divided Hindus.
Akbar’s grandson Shah Jahan was also an accomplished military leader, but his reign is remembered for its architectural achievements.
Among them is the Taj Mahal, built as a tomb for Jahan’s favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal.
The Russian Empire grew out of resistance to Mongol rule and the fall of Constantinople.
A ruler of the Grand Duchy of Moscow named Ivan III refused to pay tribute to the Golden Horde and after the death of the last Greek Orthodox Christian emperor, Ivan decided his kingdom would become the new Rome.
He annexed the khanates of Kazan, Astrakhan, and Siberia and recruited Cossacks from southern Russia and Ukraine to colonize Siberia.
Russia became the largest kingdom in the world, stretching from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean, but much of it was unoccupied and primitive.
Peter I visited Europe in disguise for 18 months to study shipbuilding and new administrative techniques that he used to modernize his realm and establish the Russian Empire.
We'll return to Modern World History 59 Russia later, but let’s explore some of the things that attracted Peter to Europe in the late 1600s.
The Enlightenment and Protestant Reformation 1346 1347 1348 9135191352) 1353» « Approximate border between the Principality Sane Land trade routes ey of Kiev and the Golden Horde passage ue prohibited for Christians.
Even before the bubonic plague arrived, harsh winters and rainy summers beginning around 1310 had caused widespread famine.
Feudal lords squeezed their peasants for crops and labor, and states raised taxes.
Several million died during the famine, and then two thirds of Europe’s population disappeared between the plague’s arrival in 1847 and 1353.
This depopulation threatened the power of the Church and the nobility, as surviving peasants became less patient with the taxes and labor demands of their bishops and lords.
Peasant revolts in France and England in the second half of the 14th century showed the feudal system of the Middle Ages was coming to an end.
Unlike the new eastern Muslim empires and the continuing Chinese Empire, Europe was unable to reunify under a single leader and create its own empire—although Austria’s Hapsburg dynasty did its best to lead an alliance optimistically named the Holy Roman Empire for centuries.
Too many languages and local centers of power competed for dominance, and the Catholic Church was unable to exercise secular as well as spiritual power.
Instead the church found itself pulled into regional contests for power, and in 1809 a French-born Pope moved his residence to Avignon.
Seven popes resided in France under the control of the French king until 1378, when another French-born Pope decided to move back to Rome.
But the French rulers and a growing class of aristocratic French cardinals were unwilling to give up the power that came with having their own Pope.
For another sixty years there were two competing Papal Courts, one in Rome and a rival in Avignon.
Although the Avignon Popes have been called Anti-Popes, it’s important to understand that the conflict was primarily about political power rather than about theology or religious doctrine.
Modern World History 61 Papal Palace in Avignon, France The arrival of the printing press in Europe in the middle of the fifteenth century allowed critics of the church like the friar Martin Luther to publish books and pamphlets calling for reform.
Printing was a Chinese invention that was improved by Johannes Gutenberg’s first complete book was probably this Bible.
Printing spread classical Greek and Roman texts that had been carried to Europe by refugees from Constantinople, helping ignite the Renaissance of Europe.
A new philosophy called Humanism focused scholars on learning that was not contained in Scripture or in church-approved sources, and on skepticism toward the decrees of religious authorities.
Some Renaissance geniuses like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo did not directly challenge the claims of political and religious authorities.
The encounter with the Americas (the topic of the next chapter) also upset a traditional understanding of the world’s origin and history that did not account for the existence of these continents.
And religious reformers like Martin Luther used the 62 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford ability to print books to radically change the way Europeans thought about their Christianity and the Catholic Church.
Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk who began the Protestant Reformation as a_ reaction against what he perceived as a betrayal of Christian ideals by the wealthy and __ selfindulgent Catholic Church.
Among Among _ Luther’s radical ideas was that the A portrait of Martin Luther as an Catholic Church and _ the Augistinian monk, before his break from Papacy were so corrupt and the Catholic Church far away from the teachings of Jesus that Christianity needed to be reestablished, rather than reformed.
In 1516 the Catholic Church began selling indulgences to raise money for the construction of St.
Indulgences Modern World History 63 were basically tickets for “time off” in purgatory (the place souls went to purify before entering heaven), and Luther objected on theological grounds; he also criticized the wealthy Pope for taxing the poor to build an unnecessary Vatican monument he could easily afford himself.
Luther did not intend to split from the Catholic Church, but after his 95 Theseswere translated from Latin to German, his criticism of the church and his new approach to theology caught on.
Czech religious reformer Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in 1415) and was excommunicated in 1521.
The church banned Luther’s books, but Luther was a prolific writer who went on to publish scores of works using the new printing press condemning the Roman church.
Printing presses and expanding European literacy helped accelerate the Reformation.
The Reformation was not the only challenge that alarmed religious authorities into reacting with persecution.
When Galileo used a telescope to prove Copernicus’s new theories that extended understanding of planetary motion beyond Galileo's middle finger, preserved in the the second-century theories science museum of Florence, Italy of Ptolemy, it was not the ancient Greeks who put him under house arrest for the rest of his life and nearly burned him as a heretic, but the Catholic Church—Copernicus and Galileo were rejecting a humancentered world founded by God Himself.
Galileo’s challenge to the Church’s outdated description of the natural world was the first of many disputes that science has had (and continues to have) with religious authority.
To be fair, though, the idea that new data should challenge centuries of intellectual and theological tradition was as radical as the idea that the Earth orbits around the Sun and not vice versa.
The Church, and European society in general, sought to have eternal and unchanging answers for social and personal conditions.
Although today we are accustomed to the idea that new information that can reorganize the ways we understand the world is always becoming available, this was not part of the early modern worldview—which makes Galileo and Luther such radical figures in European and Western history.
As challenges became more frequent, some people tried to Modern World History 65 resist them by force.
The Inquisition and persecution of witches flourished because authorities felt threatened.
The development of science in Europe during the Renaissance would not have been possible without the contributions made by Muslim scholars.
During the period when Europe was suffering an intellectual “Dark Age” in the — centuries following the fall of Rome, the embrace of Islam in North Africa, the Middle East, and beyond created stability that encouraged the establishment of trade routes to China, which was accompanied by an exchange of ideas and technology.
Arab mathematicians were also impressed with the Indian number system, which included the concept of zero—in the 1200s, western Europeans began to change from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals.
There would be no computers without this revolutionary change in mathematics..try dividing using Roman numerals.
Arab scholars helped trigger the Renaissance which led to both the European Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution that produced the modern world we live in today.
The introduction of ideas in astronomy, navigation, and mathematics in Iberia soon spread to other parts of Europe.
In 1492, Christopher Columbus was able to sail to the New World partly because of Arab naval and navigation technology.
The European philosophers and scientists who led the Enlightenment were dominated by Isaac Newton , who co-invented calculus and produced the first unified theory of nature.
Newton’s Principia Mathematica (first published in 1687) created a foundation for all the physics and engineering that followed it, and his theories were basically undisputed until Einstein and quantum physics took up the challenge of describing the universe at the macroscopic and microscopic levels in the early 2O0thcentury.
Other important Enlightenment thinkers included Emilie du Chatelet, a French aristocrat who studied and translated both Newton and his chief rival, German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
Modern World History 67 Leibniz was the other inventor of Calculus, and the version we now use is actually based a little bit more on his notation system than on Newton’s.
These scholars and their colleagues described their field as “natural science” and they tried to find natural laws for society, politics, and the economy to parallel Newton’s discoveries of gravity and optics.
Kant famously explained that his aufklarung was humanity’s emergence from its selfimposed adolescence. v oe » C ie 5 rT a Fike, S \J The Prague Orloj, or Astronomical Clock, dates back to 1410.
One of the consequences of Newton’s physics and other Enlightenment ideas was a crisis in religion.
Although Newton himself seems to have believed in a God of some type, the universe he described in his theories did not require a personal deity to be actively engaged in making things happen.
Newton’s universe seemed more like one of the new mechanical clocks 68 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford that were just becoming popular.
These complex machines might require a mechanical engineer or a watchmaker to design and build them, but once made and wound they could be left to themselves.
Absorbing this watchmaker metaphor, many Enlightenment thinkers rejected the popular religious vision of an activist God who was involved in the day-to-day operation of the world, who rewarded the righteous and punished sinners, or who chose sides in history.
The Protestant idea of predestination suggested that there was no free will, and that from God’s perspective time and chance did not really exist—Newton and other European scientists challenged that notion.
Many also began to doubt traditional stories of the deity’s interference in history, including the Christian story of Jesus.
For example, Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote an essay on miracles in 1748 that was widely influential and is still a required text for philosophy students.
For Hume, the issue that divided religious believers from skeptics was not actually miracles, but testimony about miracles reported to have happened years, decades, or even centuries ago.
In contrast, Hume argued, laws of nature could be deduced right now because they continued to operate and their effects could be seen every day.
Hume left this essay out of the first edition of his book, An Enquiry into Human Understanding, to avoid antagonizing the faithful.
But it found its way into print and remains an important challenge to traditions that seek to assert their authority based on supernatural claims.
Capitalism, the idea that invested wealth can be an engine for economic, social, and _ technological development, was most famously explained by the English philosopher Adam The old Town Hall where the Bank of Smith.
An agricultural Amsterdam was founded in 1609 revolution contributed to increased crop production and population growth in the 1400s, and that led to a surplus population being able to gather in towns and cities to engage in artisanal activities—metropolises which were once mainly centers of commerce and government and Church administration, began to produce goods for trade as well.
Even before the development of mechanized textile factories in Great Britain, for example, weavers lived and worked in districts like East London for generations.
People began to specialize in particular trades, making products for customers beyond their own families and neighborhoods.
Banks in Europe began forming financial networks that standardized prices across larger regions, such as in Italy, the Low Countries and along the Baltic coast.
As networks improved, these opportunities decreased or at least were pushed farther away.
Although Adam Smith famously described the “Invisible Hand” of market forces in 1776, merchants were heavily involved in government in England and Europe, influencing their nations’ policies and regulations to favor their own goals.
Also, as described in later chapters, imperial expansion and colonial armies were indispensable for the spread of capitalism throughout the world.
Modern World History 71 The Reconquista and Portuguese Trade with Africa Depiction of the Muslim surrender of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella, ending the Reconquista In the next chapter, we will turn to the Americas and their discovery by Europeans.
The backstory for this discovery and colonization is the Reconquista, a centuries-long effort by the Portuguese and Spanish to push the Muslim Moors back to Africa.
The Portuguese Christians “reconquered” more quickly, because Portugal does not extend as far into the south and the Spanish kings and princes had to contend with the fortified cities of Seville and Granada.
However, Portugal also captured Ceuta, a Moroccan fortress in North Africa in 1415, which gave them control over the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
The Portuguese were becoming 72 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford merchants and traders while the Christian Spanish were still fighting Muslims.
Portuguese mariners, following the route established by Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco de Gama in 1488 and 1497, began sailing to Asia around southern Africa.
They conquered coastal east African city-states, established colonies in Angola and Mozambique, and took advantage of a slave-trading network that provided possibly 10 million captives for Muslim slave auctions from the 9th century to the twentieth.
Portuguese control of the African coast was one of the reasons the royal court in Lisbon showed little interest in Columbus’s proposal to sail west across the Atlantic to India; it is also why the Spanish were eager to take Columbus up on his plan in search of a route to Asia.
As mentioned above, in the wake of the Black Death peasants and artisans demanded and received better pay, leading to increased commercial activity in Europe in the late 1800s which included not only the important Mediterranean trade dominated by Italian merchants, but also in the Baltic and across the English Channel.
However, economic expansion was limited by the availability of gold and silver coins, which had been used in exchange since the sixth century BCE in Greece and Persia.
Portuguese merchants were interested in developing a route around Africa to Asia for the trade in spice and silks, but they Modern World History 73 were pleased to find trade in sub-Saharan Africa as well.
The story of the enormous gold reserves of Mansa Musa, Muslim ruler of Mali, were well known to Europeans, especially after he spent enormous amounts of gold in the Middle East during his pilgrimage to Mecca in the 1827.
The Portuguese enquired about the availability of gold in every contact that they made in their explorations, and were not disappointed.
Present-day Ghana in West Africa was known as the “gold coast” by European traders and imperialists until its independence in 1957, and is still second only to South Africa in gold production on the continent. hs sna ab) rae fA TIO) Le Detail from the Catalan Atlas of 1375 showing Mansa Musa sitting on a throne and holding a gold coin African gold certainly aided in economic exchange in Europe, but it was not enough.
The African Slave Trade As in most world societies in the 1400s, the institution of slavery was a traditional element in African kingdoms and chiefdoms.
Captives were usually acquired through war or as for payment of debts, and enslaved for a period of time or even for life.
However, enslaved captives often gained positions in the societies that had captured them, and their children were generally born free.
African traders were willing to include this human cargo in commerce with the Portuguese and other Europeans, who readily accepted them as enslaved laborers and domestic servants.
The trade of enslaved people, especially from eastern Europe, had been important in many parts of that continent even into the 1400s.
We have seen that in the Ottoman Empire, the Janissaries were eastern European captives who were trained as an elite military corps.
The thriving economies of all of the Islamic empires, from Spain through Persia, also created a demand for enslaved people from Europe.
Although the demand for enslaved labor was less in Europe than in the more economically-developed Muslim world, some European slaves certainly served owners in the fiefdoms of the western Europe.
One can easily imagine how this would lead to ideas Modern World History 75 of superior and inferior races—within a few generations, slaveowning “whites” would consider “blacks” to be only suited for enslavement.
However, what made the African slave trade so lucrative by the 1500s and into the beginning of the 1800s was not the demand for labor in Europe, but rather on sugar plantations on the islands of the Atlantic and later in Brazil and the Caribbean.
The vast majority of the enslaved from Africa were used as forced labor in the back-breaking cultivation and processing of sugar cane.
Portuguese trade with sub-Saharan Africa coincided with the discovery that sugar cane grew well on the eastern Atlantic islands off the African coast controlled by the Portuguese and Spanish in the 1400s.
A Portuguese sugar mill, worked by African slaves, 1648 Sugar cane itself was first developed in the archipelagos of Southeast Asia.
Arab traders brought the plant to the Middle East, where Europeans discovered sugar during the crusades and developed a taste for it through their commerce in the region.
Sugar was at first considered an exotic medicinal, but once the Portuguese and Spanish began cultivating cane on the Madeiras and Canary Islands, a European addiction to sugar soon began—replacing honey as the region’s main sweetener.
Eventually, more than two thirds of all enslaved Africans in the Western Hemisphere were involved in cultivating, harvesting, and processing sugar cane in Brazil and the Caribbean.
Sugar was such a lucrative cash crop for plantation 76 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford owners, that they would import enslaved Africans, work them to death in three to five years, and bring in more.
The Portuguese established the first European colony in subSaharan Africa, which they called Angola, in 1575, south of the powerful Kongo kingdom on the West African coast.
The Kongolese royal family had converted to Christianity and the ruler, Afonso I, tried to negotiate as a peer with the rulers of Portugal.
King Afonso was not able to prevent Portuguese slave traders from indiscriminately taking people with high social status in his kingdom as slaves.
Generally only criminals and war captives were sold to foreign slavers, not the sons of noblemen and the king’s relatives.
It is unclear whether King Afonso tried to ban all trade in slaves, or whether he compromised to avoid antagonizing his European allies.
Either way, his ban was ineffective and the Portuguese carried off more and more slaves to their sugar plantations in Brazil.
Occasionally the Iberians tried to claim that they were doing the Africans a favor by Christianizing them.
But conditions on sugar plantations were so harsh that slaves typically only survived a few years.
So their conversions were not so much to prepare them for a life as Christians, but to save their souls when they perished from overwork and malnutrition.
Over the next several centuries, nearly six times more Africans were forcibly sent to the Americas than Europeans who went willingly.
In all, about 16 million Africans were shipped to the Americas in chains.
About 4 million died on the way and were thrown overboard into the Atlantic.
And we cannot reckon how great the damage is, since the mentioned merchants are taking every day our natives, sons of the land and the sons of our noblemen and vassals and our relatives, because the thieves and men of bad conscience grab them wishing to have the things and wares of this kingdom which they are ambitious of; they grab them and get them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the corruption and licentiousness that our country is being completely depopulated, and Your Highness should not agree with this nor accept it as in your service.
And to avoid it we need from those your kingdoms no more than some priests and a few people to reach in schools, and no other goods except wine and flour for the holy sacrament.
That is why we beg of Your Highness to help and assist us in this matter, commanding your factors that they should not send here either merchants or wares, because it is our will that in these kingdoms there should not be any trade of slaves nor outlet for them.
Concerning what is referred above, again we beg of Your Highness to agree with it, since otherwise we cannot remedy such an obvious damage.
Pray Our Lord in His mercy to have Your Highness under His guard and let you do forever the things of His service. | kiss your hands many times.
And as soon as they are taken by the white men they are immediately ironed and branded with fire, and when they are carried to be embarked, if they are caught by our guards’ men the whites allege that they have bought them but they cannot say from whom, so that it is our duty to do justice and to restore to the freemen their freedom, but it cannot be done if your subjects feel offended, as they claim to be.
And to avoid such a great evil we passed a law so that any white man living in our kingdoms and wanting to purchase goods in any way should first inform three of our noblemen and officials of our court whom we rely upon in this matter...who should investigate if the mentioned goods are captives or free men, and if cleared by them there will be no further doubt nor embargo for them to be taken and embarked.
But if the white men do not comply with it they will lose the aforementioned goods.
And us we have got neither dispensaries nor drugs which might help us in this forlornness, many of those who had been already confirmed and instructed in the holy faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ perish and die; and the rest of the people in their majority cure themselves with herbs and breads and other ancient methods, so that they put all their faith in the mentioned herbs and ceremonies if they live, and believe that they are saved if they die; and this is not much in the service of God.
And to avoid such a great error and inconvenience, since it is from God in the first place and then from your kingdoms and from Your Highness that all the good and drugs and medicines have come to save us, we beg of you to be agreeable and kind enough to send us two physicians and two apothecaries and one surgeon, so that they may come with all the necessary things to stay in our kingdoms, because we are in extreme need of them.
We shall do them all good and shall benefit them by all means, since they are sent by Your Highness, whom we thank for your work in their coming.
We beg of Your Highness as a great favor to do this for us, because besides being good in itself it is in the service of God as we have said above.
Excerpts from Luther's Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, 1520.
The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has suffered terribly.
First, if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction 80 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.
Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.
Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they invented the notion that no one may call a council but the Pope.
Thus they have privily stolen from us our three sticks, so that they may not be beaten.
Now may God help us, and give us one of those trumpets that overthrew the walls of Jericho, so that we may blow down these walls of straw and paper, and that we may have a chance to use Christian rods for the chastisement of sin, and expose the craft and deceit of the devil; thus we may amend ourselves by punishment and again obtain God's favor.
As St Paul says , we are all one body, though each member does its own work so as to serve the others.
This is because we have one baptism, one Gospel, one faith, and are all Christians alike; for baptism, Gospel, and faith, these alone make spiritual and Christian people.
As for the unction by a pope or a bishop, tonsure, ordination, consecration, and clothes differing from those of laymen-all this may make a hypocrite or an anointed puppet, but never a Christian or a spiritual man.
For, if we had not a higher consecration in us than pope or bishop can give, no priest Modern World History 81 could ever be made by the consecration of pope or bishop, nor could he say the mass or preach or absolve.
Therefore the bishop's consecration is just as if in the name of the whole congregation he took one person out of the community, each member of which has equal power, and commanded him to exercise this power for the rest; just as if ten brothers, coheirs as king’s sons, were to choose one from among them to rule over their inheritance, they would all of them still remain kings and have equal power, although one is appointed to govern.
And to put the matter more plainly, if a little company of pious Christian laymen were taken prisoners and carried away to a desert, and had not among them a priest consecrated by a bishop, and were there to agree to elect one of them ... and were to order him to baptize, to celebrate the mass, to absolve and to preach, this man would as truly be a priest, as if all the bishops and all the popes had consecrated him.
That is why, in cases of necessity, every man can baptize and absolve, which would not be possible if we were not all priests.
Since then the ‘temporal power’ is as much baptized as we, and has the same faith and Gospel, we must allow it to be a priest and bishop, and account its office an office that is proper and useful to the Christian community.
For whatever has undergone baptism may boast that it has been consecrated priest, bishop, and pope, although it does not beseem every one to exercise these offices.
For, since we are all priests alike, no man may put himself forward, or take upon himself without our consent and election, to do that which we have all alike power to do.
For if a thing is common to all, no man may take it to himself without the wish and command of the community.
And if it should happen that a man were appointed to one of these offices and deposed for abuses, he would be just what he was before.
Therefore a priest should be nothing in Christendom but a functionary; as long as he holds his office, he has precedence; if he is deprived of it, he is a peasant or a citizen like the rest.
They even imagine that a priest can never be anything but a priest-that is, he can never become a layman.
It must indeed have been the archfiend himself who said, as we read in the canon law, ‘Were the pope so perniciously wicked as to be dragging hosts of souls to the devil, yet he could not be deposed.
This is the accursed, devilish foundation on which they build at Rome, and think the whole world may go to the devil rather than that they should be opposed in their knavery.
If the article of our faith is right, ‘I believe in the holy Christian Church,’ the Pope cannot alone be right; else we must say, ‘I believe in the Pope of Rome,’ and reduce the Christian Church to one man, which is a devilish and damnable heresy.
Therefore when need requires, and the Pope is a cause of offense to Christendom, in these cases whoever can best do so, as a faithful member of the whole body, must do what he can to procure a true free council.
We were born to be masters, and we have been compelled to bow the head beneath the yoke of our tyrants, and to become slaves.
Name, title, outward signs of royalty, we possess all these; force, power, right, liberty, all these have gone over to the popes, who have robbed us of them.
It is time the glorious Teutonic people should cease to be the puppet of the Roman pontiff.
Because the pope crowns the emperor, it does not follow that the pope is superior to the emperor.
History usually began in 1492, with the Italian Cristoforo Colon’s “discovery” of America.
Even today, typical histories of America tend to consider the moment of Columbus’ landing on October 12, 1492, to be a significant turning point.
Some continue to consider Columbus a heroic explorer while others regard him as a monster and accuse him of deliberate genocide.
One of the most important things to know is that in 1500, the populations of Europe, Africa, and the Americas were quite similar.
European and Asian populations had substantially recovered from the plagues of the previous two centuries and were on the rise.
Europe and Africa had about 80 million each, and the Americas probably had a total population of around 65 million.
It’s important to understand that on the eve of Europe’s encounter with the Americas, their populations were very similar.
The pyramid of Kukulcan in Chichén Itza Reliable, storable, staple food supplies are a necessary precondition for long-term settlement and population growth — in other words the creation of cities.
Like the Europeans, Africans, and Asians, once they had created a reliable food supply, American natives built remarkable cities, especially in Central and South America.
However, by the time the Spanish arrived, the Maya were living in more separated independent city-states, seemingly having abandoned some of their more impressive temples and structures such as Chichén Itza in Yucatan.
However, more extensive surveying using recently developed laser technology has revealed that the city-states were never that separate during the Classic Period—there are new structures and buildings that are revealed through this new research, showing that the Mayan area was probably more populated than previously calculated.
To support such a population, the Maya used raised irrigated fields, creating canals—and again, more recent research has revealed that they bred a certain kind of fish to use as fertilizer, in addition to water plants and algae.
In mountainous areas, the Maya terraced the hillsides to provide flat areas for planting.
Religion and governance intertwined in Maya society, and stories of gods and goddesses were fundamental in the building of temples and determining the best times for planting and harvest.
Corn and the god related to corn were the principal concern for Maya religion and society.
They also developed a base-20 number system that included “zero” centuries before the concept was introduced into Western Europe.
The preciseness of Maya mathematics, along with the importance of the stars and planets to their religious beliefs, allowed the Maya to be more advanced than the Europeans in astronomy and to develop a more exact calendar.
Mayan religious beliefs included scraping down and redecorating their temples every sixty years.
One famous carved calendar used to calculate the precise time for this renovation and other key ceremonies ended on December 21, 2012, leading many to believe that the Maya had predicted the end of the world.
In reality, it seems that the astronomers had simply run out of room on that particular calendar.
Farther north in today’s Mexico, the Olmecs were among the first to form a complex society—they carved impressive statues including large stone heads some 3,000 years ago.
The nearby twin Mexica Triple Alliance capitals of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, built in the 1820s in the Valley of Mexico, each had more than 200,000 inhabitants when they were first encountered by the Spanish, making them as large as Paris and Milan, Europe’s most populous cities at the time.
Tenochtitlan was built on an island in Lake Texcoco and was connected to the lakeshore by a series of causeways.
They surrounded their island capital of Tenochtitlan with raised planting-beds called chinampas on floating platforms in Lake Texcoco.
This technique allowed Aztec farmers to carefully control soil fertility and watering.
The Aztecs were so concerned about the quality of the water, they created a dike across the lake that separated the fresh water around their city from the brackish water of the main lake to the east; and they drank water brought into the city via an aqueduct from springs in the hills overlooking the lake.
The Aztecs supported six people per acre using chinampas in the fifteenth century.
By comparison, Chinese intensive rice farming, the most successful agricultural technique known in Europe and Asia, supported at the same time. only about one person per acre Tiwanaku, located near the shores of Lake Titicaca in what are now the Bolivian highlands, was built about 8,500 years ago.
Its 30,000 inhabitants developed a farming technique called flooded-raised field agriculture and covered the hills around the lake with walled terraces.
Ancient terraces surrounding Lake Titicaca Centuries later, the Incas maintained and expanded by thousands of square miles these terraced farms throughout the Andes to achieve a level of agricultural production similar to the Aztecs.
Dotting the eastern slopes of the Andes were cities like the Inca capital at Cusco and its nearby towns and villages, which were also surrounded by terraced farms, many of which are still in use today.
These terraces were not only built and irrigated by hand at extremely high altitudes, but guano from coastal islands hundreds of miles away was carried in via well-built Inca roads to fertilize the Andean farms.
Many of these native cities have been hidden and their buildings and terraces torn apart by rainforest trees over the last five centuries.
Machu Picchu, a smaller settlement located on a mountain peak about sixty miles from Cusco, was only encountered by Westerners in 1911.
The fact that it had been undiscovered by the Spanish provided a clearer picture of how the Inca had organized their settlements, with terraces for agriculture and buildings made of seamless stonework using large blocks of carved rock—far superior to most European masonry at the time.
View of the residential section of Machu Picchu Complex societies in the Americas were not restricted to just the Aztec, Maya, and Inca.
In Colombia there is evidence of large ceremonial cities built in the northern highlands near Modern World History 93 the Caribbean Coast before the arrival of the Spanish, while other indigenous groups built complex irrigation systems in the lowlands just off the Caribbean Coast.
The Muisca in the eastern highlands of present-day Colombia, settled at a high altitude, around 8000 feet above sea level.
They cultivated corn and quinoa on the extensive flatland valleys between the mountains, controlled extensive salt deposits, and traded salt for gold, emeralds, fruits and other lowland products with neighboring indigenous groups.
Their architecture was impressive, but built with massive tree trunks rather than stone, so that no examples survived the Spanish conquest.
The Muisca did not develop a writing system like the Maya and Aztecs, but maintained religious rituals and beliefs focused on ancestor worship and the sacredness of their kings.
Each year, at a round ceremonial lake outside of present-day Bogota, the Muisca king powdered himself in gold dust and dove into the waters as a purification rite for the gods.
This practice is the origin of the myth of El Dorado, the “Golden Man,’ sought by the Spanish in their early explorations.
Over time, Spaniards such as Coronado came to believe they were searching for a city of gold, which they never found.
The natives of North America also settled in complex societies in various regions, based mainly on the cultivation of corn, wild rice, squash, and pumpkins and on managing the environment to promote the success of game animals.
The traditional United States and Canadian Thanksgiving dinner celebrates the native foods of North America, including the turkey.
Along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, indigenous people lived mostly in villages but occasionally gathered into cities and built mounds like those found at Cahokia.
By the time of contact 94 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford with Europeans, the Iroquois had formed a confederacy of five major tribes.
The Ojibwe and Dakota were also semi-sedentary, living in settlements in the western Great Lakes region and on the edge of the northern Great Plains.
By the time of contact with the Europeans, the Dakota dominated the Plains, where they took advantage of the large herds of buffalo as a source of protein, clothing, and housing, while gathering wild rice and cultivating corn and squash for carbohydrates.
Many North American forest-dwellers also developed the sap of the maple tree as a key source of sugar.
Of course, all this agriculture and city-building and civilization was happening in the Americas without anyone in Europe, Asia, or Africa knowing about it.
Although it is NOT true that everybody believed the world was flat until Columbus came along, some Europeans were unclear on the actual size of the Earth, the existence of American continents and the Pacific Ocean.
Butnot all Europeans were unaware there was something valuable across the Atlantic.
It’s important to realize that European exploration did not BEGIN with Columbus.
Around 1000 CE, five hundred years before the Italian explorer set out to discover a new trade route to Asia for Spain, Norse explorers from Europe and Iceland had established a presence on Greenland.
The Greenland colony lasted four hundred years and was a base for exploration and settlement even further west.
Leif Erikson, son of the Greenland colony’s leader Erik the Red, began a colony in what is now northern Newfoundland.
For a long time, historians thought Scandinavian claims about a North American colony called Vinland were just patriotic Modern World History 95 folktales.
They visited by Vikings. also faced strenuous opposition from natives they called Skraelings, who according to the Viking sagas were fierce warriors.
This map made in Iceland in 1570 identifies the area at the latitude of Newfoundland as Skralinge Land.
And on a more recent map of Greenland, from 1747, you can see the names of old Viking settlements as well as a channel it was believed had once cut through the island.
Textbooks tend to stress European desire for gold and silver, and finding precious metals was very important to explorers like the conquistadors.
But we shouldn’t underestimate Europeans’ fear of famine, especially during the Little Ice Age.
Even before Columbus’s voyage, Basque and Portuguese fishermen were regularly visiting the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland to catch cod.
A 1497 account by Giovanni Caboto (another Italian explorer who anglicized his name to John Cabot) claimed cod were so plentiful on the coast of North America that European fishermen could almost walk from ship to ship on their backs.
Salted cod is still an important element of traditional Portuguese cuisine, although nowadays they get their fish from Norway.
The fisheries were originally a closelyguarded trade secret, but by the time Columbus made his famous journey they were well-known —and since cod was usually dried on racks onshore before being carried back to Europe, Columbus and his crew were probably not the first Europeans to make landfall in the Americas after the Viking settlements had been abandoned.
Columbus’s promise to find a sea-route to Asia interested European monarchs like Ferdinand and Isabella because landbased trade routes to Asia were becoming more difficult and expensive.
The collapse of the Mongol Empire at the end of the thirteenth century and the plagues of the fourteenth century increased the perceived danger of overland travel.
Columbus had failed to interest Portugal in his proposal, because Bartolomeu Dias had already discovered a route to Asia around the bottom of Africa.
On the other hand, Spain had recently unified with the marriage of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castille, and the monarchs had just completed the Reconquista and ejected Muslims from Granada, their last kingdom on the Iberian peninsula.
Their war on behalf of religion and glory would continue in 98 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford the New World.
It’s also worth noting that the inventions that sparked this new era of exploration and empire building, like the sternpost rudder, the compass, gunpowder, and the printing press, were all Chinese inventions that found their way to Europe over an already-existing international trade network dominated by Arab merchants, which was about to become truly global with the European encounter of the Americas.
Columbus arrived in the Caribbean on October 12, 1492, and explored until late December.
His flagship, the Santa Maria, ran aground on Hispaniola on December 25 and had to be abandoned.
With permission of the local chief, Columbus left 39 sailors behind in a settlement he named La Navidad.
He returned to Europe with two ships, a few captive Taino natives, some gold, and specimens of New World species including turkeys, pineapple, and tobacco.
But this document was the explorer’s report to his royal sponsors, and Columbus wanted very badly to be sent back again.
Whether or not Columbus understood he was reporting on lands previously unknown to Europeans, he definitely got his readers excited about the places he had visited.
Third voyage ——— BS zh ‘ourth voyage When other European explorers reached America they were equally amazed.
People throughout Europe read exciting traveler’s accounts like Amerigo Vespucci’s 1504 best-seller, Mundus Novus, which actually coined the term New World and made it clear for anyone who might still be confused, that these lands were not Asia but a previously unknown continent.
Like Columbus, the explorers carried back to Europe not only eyewitness accounts of wealthy civilizations, but samples of native plants, animals, and captive people.
Other old-world crops that thrived in the Americas included coffee and bananas, originally cultivated in Africa and Asia, which were brought from the Canary Islands in 1516.
The Spanish had introduced sugar cultivation to the Canary Islands in the early fifteenth century, and transplanted canes to the tropical paradise their explorers had discovered across the Atlantic.
Even species like the wild horses of the American West that would transform Plains Indian culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were the descendants of escapees from the herds of the conquistadors.
The Americas had very few large mammal species, and most could not be domesticated.
Nearly all the species humans have successfully domesticated, the familiar residents of the modern farmyard, originated in Europe and Asia.
The Spanish and Portuguese dominated the first century of exploration, conquest and colonization in the Americas for many reasons.
Spain and Portugal had an eight-century long tradition of warfare from fighting the Reconquista against the Moors, and were prepared for further battle for glory and religion.
The Portuguese also had a maritime tradition, which was how Columbus learned his trade.
The Spanish and Portuguese were granted a license by the Pope under the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which awarded all the territory east of the 47th meridian to Portugal and everything west of it to Spain.
The Pope who made this deal was a Spaniard named Rodrigo Borja — his reign was known for nepotism and corruption, and, despite a pledge of clerical celibacy, he was the father of the famous Italian political family known for poisoning their enemies, the Borgias.
The Portuguese received the east, because they were already establishing colonies on the east and west coasts of Africa.
The Spanish were assigned the unknown west, which turned out to be bigger than anyone had expected.
This type of corruption at the Vatican helped motivate reformers like Martin Luther toward what became the Protestant Reformation.
The Columbian Exchange Historians call the transfer of plants and animals that began with the encounter between Europe and the Americas after 1492 the Columbian Exchange.
The directions of these biological transfers and their effects on the environments and people of Europe and the Americas shaped the modern world we live in.
American maize, potatoes, and cassava fed growing European, African, and Asian populations, allowing the building of new cities and industries.
European animals such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and cattle thrived in the Americas, enabling both Native Americans and Europeans there to add and maintain animal protein to their diets and eventually expand their populations.
When prehistoric Eurasians began living in close contact with the species they domesticated, the people were affected almost as much as the animals they kept.
Most of humanity’s major diseases originated in animals and crossed from domesticated species to their human keepers.
Whooping cough and influenza came from pigs; measles and smallpox from cattle; malaria and avian flu from chickens.
The people who domesticated these species and lived with the animals for generations co-evolved with them.
Animal diseases became survivable when people developed antibodies and immunity.
Without the inherited protection enjoyed by most Eurasians and Africans, even a routine childhood disease such as chickenpox was initially devastating for Native Americans, who did not have domesticated animals and thus little acquired immunity to these diseases.
The introduction of a disease into an area without inherited immunity is called a virgin soil epidemic.
Such epidemics had happened in Eurasia, when the Romans spread smallpox into the populations they conquered, and in Europe when the expanding Mongols introduced bubonic plague, the Black Death that killed probably half the population of Europe in the fourteenth century, reducing world population by about a hundred million.
Virgin soil epidemics spread across the Americas when explorers and colonists introduced Eurasian diseases to the Native Americans.
The Eurasian diseases that attacked native populations included smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenza, typhus, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, bubonic plague, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and malaria.
Even the Black Death did not kill as large a percentage of Europeans, and when diseases recurred in Europe, 1540 European depiction of Aztecs they generally killed their suffering from smallpox. victims over a much longer time-span due _ to _ the inherited immunity of European populations.
American native populations had no such safeguards, and disease spread virulently.
For example, there were over a million people living on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1492 when Columbus left his 39 sailors in La Navidad.
The populations of other Caribbean islands like Cuba were similarly wiped out.
Whole societies disappeared, and this was not only a tragedy for the cultures that vanished.
The reduction of native populations began a cycle of violence that became central to the history of the Americas.
The greater population densities of Central and South America enabled contagious diseases to spread more quickly there.
Heavily-traveled roads in central Mexico actually helped spread disease beyond areas that had been reached by Spanish explorers.
The population of the Aztec heartland dropped from about 25 million on the eve of the Spanish conquest in 1519 to just under 17 million a decade later.
After another decade the Aztec population was reduced to about 6 million.
By 1580, the Aztec empire had been hollowed out to less than 2 million people, from a starting point of 25 million.
The depopulation of the Americas is one of the Earth’s most significant population disasters, both in its human toll and in the changes it brought about.
Over the years, aS you might expect, there has been a lot of controversy about what happened.
To defend themselves, colonialists accused the Aztec and Inca Empires with atrocities of their own and have emphasized the support conquistadors received from indigenous rivals of these empires.
Textbooks often reflect some of these biases, one, for example, mentions that “Allegedly, between 20,000 and 80,000 men, women, and children were slaughtered in a single ceremony in 1487” as a sacrifice at a temple in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.
This claim may or may not be true, but even if it is, compare it to the deaths of over 20 million men, women, and children that followed the Spanish invasion of the Aztec lands of Central Mexico.
Traditional European or Eurocentric American histories of exploration often present the victory of the 1550 illustration shows Cortés meeting Spanish over the a ements AZiee as. ant example of the superiority of Europeans over the savage Indians.
When Cortes explored central Mexico, he encountered a region simmering with native conflict.
Far from being unified and content under Aztec rule, many peoples in Mexico resented the overlords of Tenochtitlan and were ready to rebel.
Cortés was also aided by an enslaved Nahua woman, Malintzin , whom the natives of Tabasco gave him as a tribute slave.
In addition to speaking Nahua and Maya, Malintzin quickly learned Spanish and translated for Cortés in his dealings with Aztec emperor Moctezuma.
Their son, Martin, was one of the first “mestizos” (persons of mixed indigenous American and European descent) in Spanish America.
Malintzin remains a controversial figure in the history of the Atlantic World.
In either case, she demonstrates one way in which native peoples responded to the arrival of the Spanish.
Without her, Cortés would not have been able to communicate, and without the language bridge, he surely would have been less successful in destabilizing the Aztec Empire.
By this and other means, native people helped shape the conquest of the Americas.
The Inca Empire in the Andes suffered the same fate. 90% of the South Americans died, and they started dying BEFORE the white invaders arrived in 1582, which caused confusion and dismay.
When Pizarro crossed the Andes with eighty conquistadors, he found social chaos.
Huayna Capac, the Inca leader who had triumphantly extended the empire into Chile and Ecuador, had died of smallpox in 1527.
His two sons fought a brutal civil war for control of the empire, the younger son Atahualpa finally defeating and assassinating his older brother Huascar.
Inca roads, the extent of the empire, and The civil war exacerbated the Inca cities taken over by the Spanish aires. ot epidemics, and the weakness of the reduced Inca population gave Pizarro the opportunity he needed to capture and kill Atahualpa in 1533, beginning the end of the Inca empire.
Although the conquistadors focused much of their energy on Central and South America, they brought disease to North America as well.
He died of fever in Louisiana in 1542, and although the region was visited by a few missionaries, it was not seriously considered again by Europeans until the French aristocrat, La Salle, traveled down the Mississippi River in 1670.
The entire region had been emptied by the diseases which accompanied De Soto and his men, and had returned to wilderness.
The French explorer reported traveling hundreds of miles without passing a single village.
Historians were actually unaware until recently that the American South had once been heavily populated before the arrival of contagious Spanish explorers and missionaries.
Spanish invaders had not deliberately infected the natives with all these diseases (Europeans still had no idea at this time how viruses or bacteria worked), but they were quick to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the social chaos and military weakness of native societies in crisis.
In both Mexico and Peru, the conquistadors found allies among different indigenous groups who often thought of themselves as the victors, with Spanish help, rather than the other way around.
Still, within a few years, the Spaniards took over the capital cities of the Inca and Aztec empires, inserting themselves into the top positions in the pre-existing governments.
Patterns of tribute were maintained, as well as the labor draft of the Inca mita—although now labor would be devoted to the silver mines and not just road, irrigation, and building projects.
As they had been in Spain during the Reconquista, conquistadors were rewarded for military service with encomiendas.
From a root word meaning “entrusting,” encomiendas were grants of captured territory and the people that lived on it, who the encomendero was theoretically responsible for bringing into the Christian community.
This technique had been used in Spain to keep track of conquered Muslims and make sure they did not backslide after their forced conversions.
Europe As previously mentioned, American staple crops were successfully adopted by farmers in Europe, providing better and more reliable nutrition which sparked a population boom.
New foods like potatoes were so important in preventing the cyclical famines that regularly hit Europe, that they became a key topic in Adam Smith’s classic, On the Wealth of Nations.
Many plant species developed by native Americans are still crucial to the world economy, including not only maize, potatoes, and cassava, but also tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cacao, chili peppers, natural rubber, tobacco, and vanilla.
Quinine, a medicine made from the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree, was effective treating malaria and helped open the African and Asian tropics to European colonization.
Eurasian plants like sugar, soybeans, oranges, bananas, and rice (which probably reached America from Africa along with enslaved women who were experts growing it) were also extensively cultivated in the Americas for profitable shipment back to European markets.
Exports of native and transplanted crops helped feed growing cities and, by the mid-18th century, freed agricultural workers to enter Europe’s new industries.
Without inexpensive and abundant Native American foods, there might have been no Industrial Revolution.
Although they never found El] Dorado, the “golden man” that expanded in legends to a city of gold, Europeans did find a fair The first image of Potosi published in amount of gold.
For example, the Bolivian city of Potosi, located in the Andes at an elevation of 18,420 feet , still has the largest population of any city at that altitude.
Potosi was established by the Spanish in 1542 on the site of a long-standing native mining village at the foot of the Cerro Rico, which is a literal mountain of silver.
Potosi has a current population of about 165,000, almost identical to the _ city’s population in 1660, when the highaltitude mining center was larger than Seville, Madrid, or Rome, and when the combined population of ALL European colonies in North America was only about 75,000.
Every year between 1566 and 1815, a treasure fleet sailed from Acapulco to Manila laden with silver for the trade in China and India.
Another fleet carried not only precious metals but spices and expensive Chinese ceramics acquired in Asia from Veracruz to Spain.
Once again, products originating in the Americas were a spur to the Industrial Revolution.
Without the money minted from Latin America’s silver and gold, there might have been no global commercial boom to finance European industrialization.
Although most of the easilyextractible silver was taken out of the mountain centuries ago, the Cerro Rico is still being worked by Bolivian children whose story is told in the award-winning documentary, The Devil’s Miner, which you can view on the web if you're interested in learning more.
Mestizos Because most of the Spanish in the New World were male soldiers in the first decades of the conquest, women were taken, often forcibly, from native communities to be wives and mistresses.
One high-ranking Inca native named Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala wrote to the King of Spain around 1600, complaining that Spaniards are taking all the Indian women of childbearing age, so the place was being flooded with mestizos who were not required to work as the Indians were.
Worse, the fathers were not supporting their illegitimate children, and “if a Spaniard steals away four Indian women to make little mestizos, he will bribe the judges and refuse to recognize his paternity,” leaving their support up to the state.
Most of the countries of Latin America are built on mixed or mestizo populations; so much so that in the 1700s, the colonists tried to make distinctions between all the various types of people they believed made up their societies, to “prove” to the Spanish Crown that a logical caste system existed in the colonies.
Although these distinctions were somewhat arbitrary and were often used to uphold the power of the group at the top, in the long run many of these mixed Euro-American populations have developed strong ethnic identities.
There were only about twenty-five hundred French people in the province by 1663.
Most of them were voyageurs, fur traders who went into the northern forests to make their fortunes.
Voyageurs frequently married local Indian women, and their Canadian descendants are now recognized as a distinct ethnocultural group called Métis.
SCalpamitaaes Capel Son A “Casta” painting from colonial Spanish America, showing the variety of supposed social divisions created by ethnic mixing.
The social caste system developed in Latin America was based on both blood and origin.
They made up the landed elite, often descendants of the original encomenderos, and were the vast majority of the merchant class and some of the higher clergy.
Beneath them were mestizos, people of mixed race, who worked as artisans and in the lower clergy, or farmed their own small holdings or the estates of criollo landowners.
Indians were below mestizos, and although they often managed their own communities , tribute and labor obligations required them to work in the wage economy managed by the Spanish.
Later, when the colonists started importing African slaves, new designations like mulatto and zambo were developed to describe children of black-white and black-Indian unions.
These new “mixed” populations often played the same role in the economy and society as mestizos, although they were located closer to the sugar-growing regions to which enslaved Africans were initially brought.
The Portuguese were initially more interested in dominating trade routes in the Indian Ocean, so they mostly ignored their new possession in Brazil until French Huguenots—protestant Christians fleeing Catholic France—tried to establish a colony near present-day Rio de Janeiro in the mid-1500s.
By that time, the Portuguese had watched the Spanish become successful cultivating sugar cane in the Caribbean.
Sugar, which the Spanish and Portuguese had learned how to grow and process in the Middle East during the Crusades, was already grown with enslaved African labor on profitable plantations in Portugal’s island colonies off the African coast.
Portuguese entrepreneurs brought cane and slaves to Brazil and set up plantations along the northern coast.
By this time, the Catholic Church had prohibited the enslavement of Indians, but not of Africans.
Native Brazilians did not establish the complex societies found in Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America, so it was actually harder to “conquer” them, as they escaped deeper into the interior jungles and forests.
However, the Portuguese already had established colonies and trade ties in Africa, which soon supplied enslaved labor to the sugar plantations.
As described in the previous chapter, slavery was a traditional element in all world societies, including those of Africa, but Europeans quickly grasped the usefulness of having enslaved Africans in European communities because it would be harder for them to blend in with the local population.
The sugar trade spurred the slave trade, as well as European notions of racial superiority to justify the enslavement of people 1563 Portuguese illustration of Africa, with darker skins. featuring their castle at Elmina.
Wealthy Spanish nobles married into aristocratic families like the Austrian Hapsburgs.
In 1519 (the same year Cortés attacked Tenochtitlan and Magellan set out to circle the Earth) the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, Charles V, became Holy Roman Emperor.
Charles was also King of Spain and Portugal, which gave him legal control of all the American colonies.
Spain’s financial troubles were partly due to debts Philip’s father Charles V had accumulated as Holy Roman Emperor.
After Queen Mary’s death, Philip proposed to her successor, Elizabeth I, who turned him down.
Elizabeth’s father, King Henry VIII, had separated the Church of England from Rome in the 1530s, after a dispute with the Pope over the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella and aunt to Charles V Philip supported the claim of Mary Queen of Scots to the British throne, but when she was executed in 1587, Philip decided to invade and return England to Catholicism.
In 1588, the Spanish Armada organized by Philip was hampered by bad weather on the English Channel and then defeated by the British Royal Navy, which lost no ships while Spain lost five before withdrawing.
During the retreat, most of the Spanish navy was destroyed by storms, leaving the British in control of the Atlantic.
It was the beginning of the end of the Spanish Empire as a major European power.
Buoyed by China’s economic dominance, the Women of nineteenth-century Mexico, wearing the “China Poblana” dress that was Asian population increased originally contraband from China. from 60% of the world’s people to 67% between 1500 and 1800.
India was also highly productive; between the two empires, Asia produced 80% of all the world’s goods.
Even though we are concentrating in this chapter on the intricacies of the Atlantic World and the intersection of Africa, Europe, and the Americas, until the mid-1700s, it is important to remember that China and India dominated world commerce and industry.
Chinese silks and Indian cotton were the world’s best quality and lowest-cost textiles, and clothes made from them were worn throughout the world -— even in Spain’s colonies where the law required people to trade only with the home country.
The national costume of Mexico is called the China Poblana; it was originally a contraband silk dress worn by women of the towns.
The British were so intimidated by Asian textiles that they imposed tariffs to try to protect their own weavers from being driven out of the business.
Mercantilism, in which colonies served the home country as both a market and a source of raw materials in a closed economy, was actually not a primitive economic system that evolved into free market capitalism —it was an attempt to shield British and European merchants from an already-existing international free market in which they were too often the losers to the dominant Asian powers.
Leif Ericsson’s Discovery of America, from the Saga of Eric the Red, 1387.
Biarni Heriulfsson came out from Greenland on a visit to Earl Eric, by whom he was well received.
Biarni gave an account of his travels [while lost at sea in a fog for several days, he apparently landed in America] when he saw the lands, and the people though that he had been lacking in enterprise, since he had no report to give concerning these countries; and the fact brought him reproach.
Biarni was appointed one of the Earl's men, and went out to Greenland the following summer.
Leif, the son of Eric the Red, of Brattahlid, visited Biarni Heriulfsson and bought a ship of him, and collected a crew, until they formed altogether a company of thirty-five men.
Leif invited his father, Eric, to become the leader of the expedition, but Eric declined, saying that he was then stricken in years, and adding that he was less able to endure the exposure of sea life than he had been.
Leif replied that he would nevertheless be the one who would be most apt to bring good luck and Eric yielded to Leif’s solicitation, and rode from home when they were ready to sail.
Eric returned home to Brattahlid, and Leif pursued his way to the ship with his companions, thirty-five men.
They sailed up to the land, and cast anchor, and launched a boat, and went ashore, and saw no grass there.
Great ice mountains lay inland back from the sea, and it was as a flat rock all the way from the sea to the ice mountains; and the country seemed to them to be entirely devoid of good qualities.
Then said, Leif “It has not come to pass with us in regard to this land as with Biarni, that we have not gone upon it.
They sailed again to the land, and came to anchor, and launched the boat, and went ashore.
This was a level wooded land; and there were broad stretches of white sand where they went, and the land was level by the sea.
They returned to the ship forthwith, and sailed away upon the main with north-east winds, and were out a full day before they sighted land.
They sailed toward this land and came to an island which lay to the northward off the land.
There they went ashore and looked about them, the weather being fine, and they observed that there was dew upon the grass, and it so happened that they touched the dew with their hands, and touched their hands to their mouths, and it seemed to them that they had never before tasted anything so sweet as this.
They went aboard their ship again and sailed into a certain sound, which lay between the island and a cape, which jutted out from the land on the north, and they stood in westering past the cape.
At ebb-tide, there were broad reaches of shallow water there, and they ran their ship aground there, and it was a long distance from the ship to the ocean; yet were they so anxious to go ashore that they could not wait until the tide should rise under their ship, but hastened to the land, where a certain river flows out from a lake.
As soon as the tide rose beneath their ship, however, they took the boat and rowed to the ship, which they conveyed up the river, and so into the lake, where they cast anchor and carried their hammocks ashore from the ship and built themselves cabins there.
There was no lack of salmon there either in the river or in the lake, and larger salmon than they had ever seen before.
The country thereabouts seemed to be possessed of such good qualities that cattle would need no fodder there during the winters.
There was no frost there in the winters, and the grass withered but little.
The days and nights there were of more nearly equal length than in Greenland or Iceland.
When they had completed their house, Leif said to his companions, “I propose now to divide our company into two groups, and to set about an exploration of the country.
Leif, himself, by turns joined the exploring party, or remained behind at the house.
Leif was a large a powerful man, and of a most imposing bearing; a man of sagacity, and a very just man in all things.
There was now much talk about Leifs Vinland journey; and his brother, Thorvald, held that the country had not been sufficiently explored.
They were soon provided with an abundant and goodly supply of food; for a whale of good size and quality was driven ashore there, and they secured it, and flensed it, and had then no lack of provisions.
Karlsefni caused trees to be felled and to be hewed into timbers wherewith to load his ship, and the wood was placed upon a cliff to dry.
The cattle were hard by, and the bull began to bellow and roar with a great noise, whereat the Skrellings were frightened, and ran away with their packs, wherein were gray furs, sables, and all kinds of pelts.

An Aztec account of the Spanish attack This source aggregates a number of early written reports by Aztec authors describing the destruction of Tenochtitlan at the hands of a coalition of Spanish and Indian armies.
This collection of sources was assembled by Miguel Leon Portilla, a Mexican anthropologist.
The people were protected by their swords and sheltered by their shields.
And now you have come out of the clouds and mists to sit on your throne again.
This was foretold by the kings who governed your city, and now it has taken place.
When Montezuma had finished, La Malinche translated his address into Spanish so that the Captain could understand it.
We have wanted to see him for a long time, and now we have seen his face and heard his words.
During this time, the people asked Montezuma how they should celebrate their god's fiesta.
During this same time, The Sun commanded that Montezuma and Itzcohuatzin, the military chief of Tlatelolco, be made prisoners.
They also murdered the king of Nauhtla, Cohualpopocatzin, by wounding him with arrows and then burning him alive.
But messengers came to tell them to dress the figure of Huitzilopochtli.
On the second day they began to sing again, but without warning they were all put to death.
They brought only their embroidered cloaks, their turquoises, their lip plugs, their necklaces, their clusters of heron feathers, their trinkets made of deer hooves.
Those who played the drums, the old men, had brought their gourds of snuff and their timbrels.
The Spaniards attacked the musicians first, slashing at their hands and faces until they had killed all of them.
The Sun had treacherously murdered our people on the twentieth day after the captain left for the coast.
But on the following day we attacked him with all our might, and that was the beginning of the war.
Bartolomé de Las Casas Describes the Exploitation of Indigenous Peoples, 1542 Bartolomé de Las Casas, a Spanish Dominican priest, wrote directly to the King of Spain hoping for new laws to prevent the brutal exploitation of Native Americans.
Las Casas’s writings quickly spread around Europe and were used as humanitarian justification for other European nations to challenge Spain's colonial empire with their own schemes of conquest and colonization.
The Spaniards first assaulted the innocent Sheep, so qualified by the Almighty, like most cruel tigers, wolves, and lions, hunger-starved, studying nothing, for the space of Forty Years, after their first landing, but the Massacre of these Wretches, whom they have so inhumanely and barbarously butchered and harassed with several kinds of Torments, never before known, or heard (of which you shall have some account in the following Discourse) that of Three Millions of Persons, which lived in Hispaniola itself, there is at present but the inconsiderable remnant of scarce Three Hundred.
Nay the Isle of Cuba, which extends as far, as Valladolid in Spain is distant from Rome, lies now uncultivated, like a Desert, and entombed in its own Ruins.
For a certain Vessel, sailing to this Isle, to the end, that the Harvest being over (some good Christian, moved with Piety and Pity, undertook this dangerous Voyage, to convert Souls to Christianity) the remaining gleanings might be gathered up, there were only found Eleven Persons, which | saw with my own Eyes.
There are other Islands Thirty in number, and upward bordering upon the Isle of St.
John, totally unpeopled; all which are above Two Thousand miles in length, and yet remain without Inhabitants, Native, or People.
As to the firm land, we are certainly satisfied, and assured, that the Spaniards by their barbarous and execrable Actions have absolutely depopulated Ten Kingdoms, of greater extent than all Spain, together with the Kingdoms of Aragon and Portugal, that is to say, above One Thousand Miles, which now lye waste and desolate, and are absolutely ruined, when as formerly no other Country whatsoever was more populous.
Nay we dare boldly affirm, that during the Forty Years space, wherein they exercised their sanguinary and detestable Tyranny in these Regions, above Twelve Millions (computing Men, Women, and Children) have undeservedly perished; nor do | conceive that | should deviate from the Truth by saying that above Fifty Millions in all paid their last Debt to Nature.
Those that arrived at these Islands from the remotest parts of Spain, and who pride themselves in the Name of Christians, steered Two courses principally, in order to the Extirpation, and Exterminating of this People from the face of the Earth.
Whom they so despicably contemned, that they treated them (I speak of things which | was an Eye Witness of, without the least fallacy) not as Beasts, which | cordially wished they would, but as the most abject dung and filth of the Earth; and so solicitous they were of their Life and Soul, that the above-mentioned number of People died without understanding the true Faith or Sacraments.
And this also is as really true thatthe _Spaniards_ never received any injury from the Indians, but that they rather reverenced them as Persons descended from Heaven, until that they were compelled to take up Arms, provoked thereunto by repeated Injuries, violent Torments, and unjust Butcheries.
Bartolomé de Las Casas, A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies... , 9-16.
The Hapsburg family continued to try to maintain an entity they called the “Holy Roman Empire” but it was really an alliance of German principalities, and had ceased to include Rome in the 12th century.
During the 1600s, religion, language, and local culture began inspiring feelings of regional solidarity that grew into the idea of separate nationalities.
Some of these nations organized themselves as absolute monarchies, while in others, power was shared among different national groups.
In many of these countries, the ideas of divine monarchy and hereditary nobility had given way to a sharing of constitutional power between rulers and their subjects.
Merchants gained influence and slowly acquired legislative powers in bodies like Britain’s House of Commons.
The French Revolution, inspired in part by the revolt of Britain’s North American colonies and the establishment of the United States, would extend the experiment with democracy to include the lower classes for the first time in European history.
France’s revolution, which will be presented in this chapter, would end one of the most deeply-entrenched absolute monarchies of Europe, while Napoleon’s armies ended feudalism in most of continental Europe by 1815.
Louis XIII and his chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, concentrated power in the hands of the King.
The King stopped convening the Estates General, an advisory body made up of representatives of the clergy, the aristocracy, and _ the working people, and ruled absolutely.
Known as “the Sun King,” Louis XIV occupied the French throne for 72 years, from 1643 when he became emperor at age 4 after his father’s passing, to his death in 1715.
By the 1680s, Louis had greatly improved France’s influence in the world and had increased the power of the monarchy.
In 1682, Louis moved the royal court to Versailles, a country palace about thirteen miles from Paris, requiring nobility to live in the palace where he could keep them under his thumb.
But he also modernized Paris, under the direction of his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
In Britain’s case, the legislature, called Parliament, also controlled the government’s purse-strings.
Britain fought a Civil War German illustration of the execution of between 1642 and 1649 when King Charles | of England, January 30,1649. a Protestant religious sect known as the Puritans and their allies in Parliament led a revolt against absolute monarchy championed by King Charles I The Puritans had a much stricter interpretation of the Christian Bible and wanted to “purify” the Church of England, ridding it of remaining Catholic and liturgical practices not described in scripture.
A Puritandominated Parliamentary army led by Oliver Cromwell beat the Royalists on the battlefield and then executed Charles I in 1649.
Unfortunately, Cromwell’s ten-year experiment with a republic, which he called the Commonwealth, degenerated into a dictatorship.
After Cromwell’s death in 1659 and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Parliament held onto enough power to depose Catholic-leaning James II in 1689 and invite his daughter Mary (and her Protestant Dutch husband Prince William of Orange) to take the throne in a peaceful transfer of power that became known as the Glorious Revolution.
The French followed two decades later, building a fort in 1604 at Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and establishing Quebec on the St.
Augustine, showing the English had tried settling privateer Sir Francis Drake's 1586 attack. people on Roanoke Island, in North Carolina, in 1588, but the colony had mysteriously disappeared by the time resupply ships returned to the area a few years later.
The settlement may have been overrun by local Indians, but it is also possible that the abandoned colonists went to live with the natives when their food ran out and when help failed to arrive from England.
Throughout the early history of English settlement in North America, colonial authorities regularly tried to hush up reports of poor English colonists choosing to live with the Indians.
The English published frightening tales of captivity and redemption, although in reality poor people, especially women, were often better-treated in Indian society than in the English colonies.
After losing both their people and their entire capital investment at Roanoke, the English waited nearly 20 years before they tried settling the Chesapeake Bay region again in 1607.
The Virginia Company, a joint stock venture chartered by King James I in 1606, sent expeditions to the explore the coast of North America between the Spanish and French settlements, one of which established Jamestown forty miles inland on the James River as the first permanent English town in North America.
In 1620 a shipload of persecuted Puritans we know as the “Pilgrims” fled England and its Anglican church and landed on Cape Cod.
British colonists in North America establishing family farms for raising crops and pasturing animals like cattle and sheep, and growing cash crops like tobacco in the warmer climate of the South.
By contrast, French efforts on the continent centered on trade with Indians for beaver pelts, since the growing season was much shorter in the region between the St.
Many French voyageurs married native women, creating the mixed-ethnic community known as meétis today. focused on However, alliance with the Indians did not change the outcome of the Seven Years War for France in 1768, as we will see in a bit.
Native populations in the coastal northeast were devastated by an epidemic that raged from 1617 to 1619 and killed 95 percent of the Abenaki people and over 90 ; Puritan clergyman Cotton Mather percent of the Massachusetts tribe.
This emptying of the land was often seen by English settlers like the Pilgrims and the Puritans as a gift of divine providence.
English colonists were quick to take advantage of the empty village sites, open farmland, and social chaos among the natives caused throughout the region by the ongoing Columbian Exchange.
Colonists built houses and permanent villages, and fenced their fields.
But although they claimed complete ownership of the parcels they occupied, the Illustration of Metacomet, son of colonists let their cattle and Massasoit, by Paul Revere, 1771 pigs run loose over the countryside.
Since the natives were not protecting their lands in ways the colonists recognized, with fences, the Euro-Americans believed Indians had no idea of land ownership.
The colonists were unaware that native practices had been created for a world without domestic livestock.
When Indians treated European livestock like wildlife and shot a wandering cow, or when they killed pigs eating their un-fenced crops, the colonists demanded compensation for the destruction of their property.
The Powhatan wars in Virginia , the Pequot War in Connecticut , the Dutch-Indian War in the Hudson Valley , and the Beaver Wars all ended badly for the natives.
Even King Philip’s War , which is remembered as a disastrous, nearlysuccessful uprising by Massasoit’s son Metacomet, who had finally decided enough was enough, resulted in five times as many native deaths as English.
The Spanish, the British, the Land, the Natives The contrasts between Spanish and British colonization in the Americas are stark, and help explain subsequent social and economic development in the Hemisphere.
Spain applied the same model of Iberian conquest and colonization to the Americas, granting conquered land with all of its inhabitants to the encomenderos, who were selected for their proven loyalty to King and empire, and to the Catholic Church.
Soldiers and clergy were also pledged to Crown and Church, as well as_ the administrators, artisans and Hernan Cortés, conqueror of the Aztecs other settlers who arrived in and premier encomendero of New Spain.
The British, however, used their colonies in North America as havens for religious dissenters, as a safety-valve to reduce the numbers of the poor in England, and as dumping grounds for other troublemakers.
As mentioned above, Massachusetts was settled by Puritans who had rejected the Church of England.
Advocates of further reform soon left and settled Connecticut and Rhode Island, which were open to settlers of all religions—except Catholics who instead settled in Maryland.
Indeed, if the Spanish had followed the British policy of shipping their undesirables to the New World, “Latin” America might have become “Judeo-Islamic” America, a place where Jews and Muslims who had refused to convert to Catholicism were sent.
The Spanish and British also governed their colonies in very different ways.
The BB Spanish Crown wanted to directly rule their American empire, appointing trusted , i men—the peninsulares—to < serve as viceroys, judges, y governors, and mayors, applying laws and regulations ¥ made by the Council of the Indies in Spain.
British colonists had already had already a sense of selfa government through their parliament, which checked the power of the King and controlled the treasury.
Subsequently, in contrast to Spanish settlers, the British colonists set up legislatures, held town-hall meetings, often appointed their own governors, and made many of their own laws rather than waiting for instructions from London.
This difference in representative government, however, does not mean that the Spanish colonists were completely deferential.
They often applied the concept of “obedezco, pero no cumplo” to regulations made by the Council of Indies that they believed did not consider local realities in the Americas.
Similar protests in the Thirteen Colonies would not occur until the 1770s.
Land arrangements were also very different between the British and the Spanish.
However, for other crops (especially those for local consumption), the Spanish followed the tradition of the encomendero , in which a large landowner employed indigenous and mestizo workers, while the British settlers preferred the individual family farm.
In the long run, this economic difference affected attitudes about entrepreneurship and ideas of personal liberty.
The fourth major difference between Spanish and British America involves relationships with the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish Empire included the indigenous in their colonial project, partly because of the blood ties that connected many of the Spanish with their mestizo descendants.
Mestizos and Indians were often protected or at least tolerated by Spanish authorities in their own settlements as long as they paid tribute and at least pretended to be Catholic.
Just like their counterparts in North America, the Indians in Latin America also faced the problem of the Spanish allowing their pigs and cattle to destroy native plantings—but as Spanish colonial records reveal, the indigenous brought this injustice to local Spanish judges, who often determined in favor of the Indians.
Many natives felt part of colonial society, and confidently challenged Spanish landowners in court.
They did not have complete control over their lives and the “protection” offered by Catholic clergy required abandoning their own religion and many of their customs and practices.
The Spanish did not want to physically eliminate the indigenous, but they did advocate a cultural genocide of sorts, which was never complete due to native resistance.
But this was, in the long run, less successful than the destruction of native culture in North America because despite the Columbian Exchange there were more natives left.
Native languages thrive in many parts of Central and South America where they are preserved and spoken by millions, while the tribal tongues of North America struggle to stay relevant.
The social and economic differences between British and Spanish America clearly have consequences even today, some positive and others negative.
Caribbean Islands and Sugar Cane of 1 1S im the West INDYAES with the i’ Names of the Scuerall plantacons A topographicall Description and ee of the YLAND Map of Barbados from Richard Ligon’s True and Exact History, 1657.
In spite of the beginning of British settlement in North America, Britain’s main focus in the 17th century was the Caribbean.
We tend to forget this, because this region did not join the North American revolution in 1776 and become part of the United States.
But in the 1600s, Sugar Islands like Barbados and Jamaica were the most profitable British colonies.
Like the Spanish, North American colonists in the New World expected and hoped to find not only a place to build a new society, but also a place where they could get rich.
And right from the start, European colonies in North America were commercial.
In addition to fishing, growing tobacco, and trapping beaver, the North American colonies benefited from the booming sugar economy of the Caribbean.
Islands such as Barbados that had once been self-sufficient had begun by the mid-1600s to specialize in the profitable commodity at the expense of all other crops, so sugar planters looked to their neighbor colonies for food supplies and feed for draft animals.
John Winthrop, the Puritan leader who helped establish Boston and who was Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony four times before 1650, sent his second son Henry to help establish Barbados in 1626.
When Oliver Cromwell’s Civil War halted the flow of commercial shipping between England and the ten-year-old Bay Colony in 1640, trade with the West Indies saved Boston’s economy.
Diagram of a slave ship, printed in 1788 for an abolitionist society brochure.
About 16 million Africans were captured and transported to European slaveholding colonies during the entire period of Atlantic slavery.
Although slavery reduced African population by over 26 million (10 million to the Islamic world and 16 million to the Atlantic), American staples including corn and manioc created a population boom that exceeded the losses to the slave trade.
Additionally, since African nations—like other societies—tended to enslave captives in war, conflicts among tribes and kingdoms created an unstable social and political climate, which made sub-Saharan Africa ripe for European imperialists in the late nineteenth century, well after the slave trade with the Americas had ended.
So Spain had set up a monopoly contract for slave trading to Spanish America called the Asiento, which was initially granted to France.
In 1714, Spain shifted the Asiento to Britain and gave the South Sea Company a 30-year monopoly on selling slaves to Spain.
The Company set up slave distribution “factories” THE ASSTEN T O; CONTRACT FOR Allowing to the Subje&ts of Great Britain the Liberty of Importing Necrors into the Spanifh America.

In 1720, a speculative investment “bubble” burst, throwing the British economy into crisis.
The South Sea Company survived the burst of its bubble, mostly due to revenues from selling slaves, and its slave sales peaked in 1725, five years after the financial crisis.
Plantation owners could have changed their practices, but the reduced profits would have exceeded Painting of a sugar plantation on British the replacement costs of the Antigua, 1823. slaves, so planters chose to work slaves to death quickly and buy more.
The economic value of local “increase” produced by enslaved women was recognized in the 18th century in the North American colonies where people like Thomas Jefferson wrote about the money that could be made on these natural replacements.
Additionally, raising tobacco and other crops was less harsh than cultivating sugar cane, creating better conditions for survival.
Britain and the United States ended the slave trade in 1807 and 1808 but slavery continued in the U.S., where enslaved people in Mid-Atlantic states where tobacco was being replaced with mechanized wheat-farming were “sold down the river” to the increasingly important cotton plantations in the Deep South, creating a major profit opportunity for white Virginians.
Sometimes they ran away and formed independent communities in remote hinterlands called Maroon colonies.
Many of these Maroon colonies became stable societies, populated by escaped slaves and the descendants of ; The Battle of Palm Tree Hill, during the Indians who had run away xaitian Revolution. from the colonists’ earlier attempts to enslave them and some even lasted into the twentieth century in Central and South America.
Independence of the United States The Enlightenment encouraged a gradual shift from an understanding of political sovereignty as a gift of God (the Divine Right of Kings as expressed by absolute monarchs like Louis XIV) to ideas of popular sovereignty and government by consent of the governed or through a “social contract” between rulers and people.
Philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau began reimagining the relationship between individuals and society, while popular writers like Thomas Paine began translating these ideas into pamphlets like Common Sense and into books like The Rights of Man and The Age of Reason that were read not only by other philosophers but also by hundreds of thousands of regular literate people.
American colonists ought to pay their fair share of the cost of their defense.
Although the colonists found these taxes oppressive and obnoxious, to a great extent they were luxury taxes or excises on trade rather than direct taxes on personal income.
Still, imposing new taxes on the colonists was a miscalculation by Parliament, because the merchants and the wealthy most affected by the taxes had the means and the motivation to organize a resistance movement.
American colonists also objected to the Quartering Act that forced them to provide housing and food for British troops.
Again, this may have seemed fair to the legislators back in London who had sent an army to defend the colonies against the French and Indians in the recently-concluded war.
But it was a big expense for the Americans, and was an issue that cut across class boundaries more than the luxury taxes and unified opposition.
The support of Native Americans from the trans-Appalachian region had been critically important to the British war effort in North America.
The British created an Indian Reserve beyond the Appalachians, including western Virginia and Pennsylvania west of Pittsburgh, which had been a French fort captured in the war.
This angered both colonists who looked west for new lands to settle and land speculators who had planned on getting rich buying and selling the western territory.
Although the Declaration echoed the Enlightenment ideals of contractual government and representation, at the time these ideals only applied to white male landowners.
Many Indians sided with Britain in the American Revolution, because they saw a British victory as their only chance to prevent the colonists from overrunning them.
Many slaves also ran away to join British forces, especially after they were offered immediate emancipation by Lord Dunmore.
Many fought their former owners in Dunmore’s “Ethiopian Regiment” or secretly sided with the British against colonial slaveholders.
Most of these loyalists stayed and became United States citizens after the war, but about 70,000 left for other parts of the British Loyalists being chased out of town by their empire.
Many of those in the MPH AETICIEN OFS, north went to Canada and settled New Brunswick while southerners went to Florida, which had remained loyal under British rule, or to the British islands in the Caribbean.
After the Revolution, poor Americans were often left wondering what they had fought for.
Taxes were high and farmers couldn’t pay them because the “Continental” currency printed by the rebel government to pay the troops was worthless.
Western Massachusetts farmers who felt the new government in Boston did not represent them revolted in 1786 in Shays’s Rebellion, which was put down by government troops.
This fight and others forced leaders of the Confederated states to reconsider how a federal government should be organized, and they called a Constitutional Convention to meet in Philadelphia, with the Thirteen States sending representatives.
It acknowledged the Enlightenment concept that political power comes from the consent of the governed.
For instance, the President could veto laws passed by Congress, while Congress could, with a 2/8 majority, override the veto.
And the Supreme Court could interpret a law as being unconstitutional, checking both the President and Congress.
In spite of these checks and balances, when the Constitutional Convention sent the newly-drafted United States Constitution to all the states for ratification, many New England towns either rejected the document outright or provisionally approved it with modifications they sent back to the authorities.
Without the Bill of Rights, the Constitution would be a much different document.
The French Revolution Debt problems stemming from the Seven Years War and French support for the independence of the United States forced King Louis XVI to call the Estates-General in 1789, in order to raise revenue.
The Estates-General had not been called since 1614, and its meeting was immediately seen as an opportunity to create a new parliamentary monarchy.
In 1789, the commoners were dominated by educated merchants and large landowners who advocated for establishing a British-style parliament as a check on the King’s power.
The commoners had enough support from sectors of the clergy and nobility to declare themselves as the National Assembly, which set about forming a new government.
Dissatisfaction with the current government and excitement over establishing a new one inspired the people of Paris to form militia groups to defend the National Assembly from royalist attacks.
On July 14th, these militias dramatically took over the Bastille, a royal prison which held political dissidents.
In August the National Assembly agreed to a Declaration of the Rights of Man which claimed “Natural Law” as the basis for equal rights for all and called for liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.
Like the United States Declaration of Independence and Constitution, the Assembly declared the the “nation” was sovereign, rather than the king, and asserted the rights of freedom of speech, the press, religion, and assembly.
However, the French Revolution differed from the American in that it was not a colonial independence movement, but a rejection of an existing monarchy by the people of France.
There was a much greater degree of participation by poor people in France in this process, and the social changes attempted by the new government were much more significant than simply replacing a British ruling class with an American one as the revolution had done in the new United States.
One of the prisoners who just barely escaped with his life was Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense, who had been welcomed as an honorary citizen of the new French Republic and had even been given a seat in their new legislative assembly.
Although he had defended the French Revolution against British criticism in his book The Rights of Man, Paine was imprisoned for objecting to the execution of the French King and Queen.
Paine was scheduled for execution, but was passed over in a lucky oversight.
Other reformers like French feminist Olympe de Gouges were not so fortunate, and were killed by the revolution they had supported.
S 0 na The Execution of Maximillian Robespierre in July 1794 effectively ended the Reign of Terror.
The Reign of Terror led to a rejection of the Jacobin party and the trial and execution of Robespierre in 1794.
A more conservative government, the Directory, was installed but it failed to manage an orderly transition from the old regime to a new style of republican government.
Returning from an Egyptian campaign in 1799, Napoleon overthrew the Directory and like Julius Caesar established a 8-man Consul style government—but unlike Caesar he quickly became the sole leader.
One advantage Napoleon had establishing his empire, in addition to his effective use of the French army, was that he was able to reinstate many members of the old nobility who had been discredited or even imprisoned by _ the Revolution.
He even allowed aristocrats to reclaim some of the property the revolutionaries had _ taken from them.
Napoleon also introduced a new Civil Code in 1804 that completely revamped the French legal system and is still in use today.
The Code, designed by a panel of four eminent judges, replaced France’s old feudal legal system and has been tremendously influential in Europe and elsewhere in the world as nations developed modern legal systems.
At its height, the French Empire ruled over 70 million subjects, and to secure its most profitable colony Napoleon sent 40,000 troops across the Atlantic to Hispaniola to try to retake San Dominique from an army of rebellious former slaves led by Toussaint l’Ouverture, one of the most important leaders of the revolutionary age.
Encouraged by the French Revolution, slaves on sugar plantations on Hispaniola, which the French had renamed San Dominique, rebelled in 1791 and overthrew the white government of the island.
Slavery in French colonies was then abolished by the Jacobins in 1793 (one of the few things Robespierre got right) and the army of former slaves fought a British invasion to a standstill in a 5-year war ending in 1798.
But after declaring himself Emperor of the French, Napoleon reinstituted slavery and sent troops to retake the island for France.
The former slaves defeated the French and established the Republic of Haiti in 1804.
American republic to free jg, itself from European colonialism, the author of the Declaration refused to recognize Haiti’s independence.
The slavery-supporting South actually blocked recognition of Haiti by the United States government until the Civil War, when a North-only Congress and President Lincoln finally established diplomatic relations in 1862.
Another momentous act of Napoleon’s was his sale of 828,000 square miles of North America to the United States in 1804.
The expense of the failed war to prevent Haitian independence and the prospect of a new war with Britain convinced Napoleon to take fifty million francs for the territory it had just regained from Spain.
President Thomas Jefferson had originally been interested in buying only the city of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi River, which was an important port where produce from the interior arrived via the Mississippi.
In the case of the United States and Haiti, revolution led to the creation of new nations.
In France, revolution led to chaos and Napoleon’s attempt at empirebuilding.
Napoleon’s empire might have lasted a bit longer, if he had not been so interested in expanding it to include not only Europe and Haiti, but Russia.
Russia’s fast-moving Cossack cavalry executed a scorched-earth retreat before the advancing French army, so Napoleon’s forces arrived in Moscow hungry, only to find that the city’s quarter-million people had abandoned their homes and taken everything they could carry.
The French burned the city and began a long retreat in early October at the beginning of what turned out to be a brutal winter.
To make matters worse, Russian cavalry repeatedly cut the French supply lines, and of an original force of over 600,000 men, only about 100,000 made it back to France alive.
Napoleon was able to build the army back up again, although replacing the horses the troops had eaten during the retreat was harder.
But this crushing debacle proved to the world he wasn’t the military genius many had believed him to be.
Napoleon’s enemies invaded France in 1814, forced him to abdicate, and exiled him to Elba, a small island near his boyhood home of Corsica.
Napoleon escaped _ the Mediterranean island and regained power briefly in 1815 before being defeated at Waterloo and exiled to St.
Independence of Latin America Napoleon’s conquest of Europe inadvertently created the conditions for additional revolutions and the creation of new nations in the Americas.
As described in the last chapter, Spanish American society was based on a small aristocracy of ethnic Spanish peninsulares (people born on the Iberian peninsula) and creoles (people of Spanish descent born in the colonies) ruling large populations of mestizo populations, Indians, and slaves.
Like the leaders of the American Revolution, many of these colonial aristocrats felt the priorities of their rulers in Spain did not match their own.
Napoleon’s removal of the hereditary king and installation of his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne in 1807 removed the last shred of doubt.
Soon after Joseph Bonaparte took the throne, representative juntas were established in Caracas, Santiago, Buenos Aires, and Bogota to rule in the name of the deposed Spanish king.
In 1810 a creole priest named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla began Mexico’s revolutionary movement, by giving a speech known as the “Grito de Dolores” or simply El Grito, the Cry.
Hidalgo raised an army of 100,000 men, largely of landless peasants anxious for social reform, but they were defeated in January 1811 by a professional army of about 6,000 Spanish troops.
Another priest named José Maria Morelos took over the insurrection and convened a Congress in 1813 that wrote a constitution for Mexico called the Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la America Mexica which declared Mexico’s independence.
Unlike later independence movements in South America, Mexico’s demanded not just political but also social change.
Guerrero would be elected president of Mexico in 1829 and would be Mexico’s first black president.
King Ferdinand VII was the Spanish monarch who had been forced to abdicate in 1808 in favor of Joseph Bonaparte.
He regained the throne in 1813, but quickly became known as el Rey Felon, the criminal king.
Ferdinand rejected the liberal 1812 Constitution that had been adopted by Spain’s_ rebel government during his absence.
Cowardly, selfish, grasping, suspicious, and vengeful, seemed almost incapable of any perception of the commonwealth.
Latin American juntas and the Mexican rebels decided he did not deserve their allegiance and began fighting for their independence from Spain.
The royal government sent a general named Agustin de Iturbide against Guerrero’s forces in Mexico, but Guerrero beat Iturbide on the battlefield and then convinced him to join the revolution.
In 1811 Venezuela and Paraguay both declared their independence from Spain.
In 1816 Argentina declared its independence, followed quickly by Chile and Gran Colombia.
King Pedro of Portugal, whose father had fled to Brazil in 1807 to avoid being deposed by Napoleon, declared Brazil a constitutional empire under his rule in 1822.
In 1824, the Venezuelan Simon Bolivar, who had led the liberation of Gran Colombia, conclusively defeated the Spanish armies at Junin and Sucre, and Peru gained its independence.
He hoped Latin America would follow the example of the United States and create a federal union of all the newlyindependent nations—or at least a common economic market.
He convened a Congress of the Americas in Posthumous portrait of Simén Bolivar.ca. the summer of 1826, inviting ole all the nations of Latin America and also the United States.
The United States President, John Quincy Adams, didn’t have a very high opinion of Latin Americans but he was an opponent of slavery and all of the new Spanish America republics had immediately outlawed the slave trade and had either abolished slavery or had initiated its gradual disappearance through manumission.
Adams had been instrumental in promulgating the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, establishing the Western Hemisphere as a region under the protection of the United States and warning European nations, especially Great Britain, to limit their activities in the Americas.
Britain, however, did attend the Congress of the Americas as an observer and managed to gain several important trade deals as a result.
But blocked once again by the slaveholding South, the United States government dragged its feet.
Although the United States ultimately decided to send a delegation, it arrived only after the Congress had ended.
He resigned the presidency in the spring of 1880 and the republic dissolved into political chaos and the three separate nations of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.
United States Declaration of Independence In Congress, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.-Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in_ their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
The Haitian Declaration of Independence, 1804 The Commander in Chief to the People of Haiti Citizens: It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; it is not enough to have restrained those ever-evolving factions that one after another mocked the specter of liberty that France dangled before you.
Independence or death... let these sacred words unite us and be the signal of battle and of our reunion.
Citizens, my countrymen, on this solemn day | have brought together those courageous soldiers who, as liberty lay dying, spilled their blood to save it; these generals who have guided your efforts against tyranny have not yet done enough for your happiness; the French name still haunts our land.
There are still French in our island, and you believe yourself free and independent of that Republic which, it is true, has fought all the nations, but which has never defeated those who wanted to be free.
The difference between its cruelty and our patient moderation, its color and ours the great seas that separate us, our avenging climate, all tell us plainly that they are not our brothers, that they never will be, and that if they find refuge among us, they will plot again to trouble and divide us.
Look there for your children, your suckling infants, what have they become?... | shudder to say it ... the prey of these vultures.
Instead of these dear victims, your alarmed gaze will see only their assassins, these tigers still dripping with their blood, whose terrible presence indicts your lack of feeling and your guilty slowness in avenging them.
And you, precious men, intrepid generals, who, without concern for your own pain, have revived liberty by shedding all your blood, know that you have done nothing if you do not give the nations a terrible, but just example of the vengeance that must be wrought by a people proud to have recovered its liberty and jealous to maintain it let us frighten all those who would dare try to take it from us again; let us begin with the French.
Let them tremble when they approach our coast, if not from the memory of those cruelties they perpetrated here, then from the terrible resolution that we will have made to put to death anyone born French whose profane foot soils the land of liberty.
We have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and for ourselves.
Let us leave this description for the French; they have conquered but are no longer free.
Let us walk down another path; let us imitate those people who, extending their concern into the future, and dreading to leave an example of cowardice for posterity, preferred to be exterminated rather than lose their place as one of the world’s free peoples.
Let us ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbors to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighboring islands.
Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them.
My happy fate was to be one day the sentinel who would watch over the idol to which you sacrifice; | have watched, sometimes fighting alone, and if | have been so fortunate as to return to your hands the sacred trust you confided to me, know that it is now your task to preserve it.
Before consolidating it with laws that will guarantee your free individuality, your leaders, who | have assembled here, and I, owe you the final proof of our devotion.
Generals and you, leaders, collected here close to me for the good of our land, the day has come, the day which must make our glory, our independence, eternal.
If there could exist among us a lukewarm heart, let him distance himself and tremble to take the oath which must unite us.
Let us vow to ourselves, to posterity, to the entire Universe, to forever renounce France, and to die rather than live under its domination; to fight until our last breath for the independence of our country.
And you, a people so long without good fortune, witness to the oath we take, remember that | counted on your constancy and courage when | threw myself into the career of liberty to fight the despotism and tyranny you had struggled against for 14 years.
Remember that | sacrificed everything to rally to your defense; family, children, fortune, and now | am rich only with your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those who want slavery.
If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people.
But | reject that awful idea; you will sustain the liberty that you cherish and support the leader who commands you.
Therefore vow before me to live free and independent, and to prefer death to anything that will try to place you back in chains.
Swear, finally, to pursue forever the traitors and enemies of your independence.
MAXIMILIAN ROBESPIERRE, THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF TERROR, FEBRUARY 5, 1794 Citizen-representatives of the people.
Some time ago we set forth the principles of our foreign policy; today we come to expound the principles of our internal policy.
After having proceeded haphazardly for a long time, swept along by the movement of opposing factions, the representatives of the French people have _ finally demonstrated a character and a government.
A sudden change in the nation’s fortune announced to Europe the regeneration that had been effected in the national representation.
But up to the very moment when | am speaking, it must be agreed that we have been guided, amid such stormy circumstances, by the love of good and by the awareness of our country’s needs rather than by an exact theory and by precise rules of conduct, which we did not have even leisure enough to lay out.
The peaceful enjoyment of liberty and equality; the reign of that eternal justice whose laws have been inscribed, not in marble and stone, but in the hearts of all men, even in that of the slave who forgets them and in that of the tyrant who denies them.
We wish to substitute merit for intrigue, genius for wit, truth for glamour, the charm of happiness for sensuous boredom, the greatness of man for the pettiness of the great, a people who are magnanimous, powerful, and happy, in place of a kindly, frivolous, and miserable people which is to say all the virtues and all the miracles of the republic in place of all the vices and all the absurdities of the monarchy.
We want, in a word, to fulfill natures’s desires, accomplish the destiny of humanity, keep the promises of philosophy, absolve providence from the long reign of crime and tyranny.
Let France, formerly illustrious among the enslaved lands, eclipsing the glory of all the free peoples who have existed, become the model for the nations, the terror of oppressors, the consolation of the oppressed the ornament of the world and let us, in sealing our work with our blood, see at least the early dawn of the universal bliss -that is our ambition, that is our goal.
It is virtue. | speak of the public virtue which worked so many wonders in Greece and Rome and which ought to produce even more astonishing things in republican France that virtue which is nothing other than the love of the nation and its law.
There are important consequences to be drawn immediately from the principles we have just explained.
Since the soul of the Republic is virtue, equality, and since your goal is to found, to consolidate the Republic, it follows that the first rule of your political conduct ought to be to relate all your efforts to maintaining equality and developing virtue; because the first care of the legislator ought to be to fortify the principle of the government.
This everything that tends to excite love of country, to purify morals, to elevate souls, to direct the passions of the human heart toward the public interest, ought to be adopted or established by you.
Everything which tends to concentrate them in the abjection of selfishness, to awaken enjoyment for petty things and scorn for great ones, ought to be rejected or curbed by you.
Within the scheme of the French revolution, that which is immoral is impolitic, that which is corrupting is counterrevolutionary.
We deduce from all this a great truth that the characteristic of popular government is to be trustful towards the people and severe towards itself.
Here the development of our theory would reach its limit, if you had only to steer the ship of the Republic through calm waters.
But the tempest rages, and the state of the revolution in which you find yourselves imposes upon you another task.
We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with them.
Now, in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror.
It is less a special principle than a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country’s most pressing needs.
It has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic government.
Yes, as the sword which glitters in the hands of liberty's heroes resembles the one with which tyranny’s lackeys are armed.
Let the despot govern his brutalized subjects by terror; he is right to do this, as a despot.
Subdue liberty's enemies by terror, and you will be right, as founders of the Republic.
The government of the revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny.
To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to pardon them is barbarity.
The rigor of tyrants has only rigor for a principle; the rigor of the republican government comes from charity.
How frivolous it would be to regard a few victories achieved by patriotism as the end of all our dangers.
You will become aware that vigilance and energy are more necessary for you than ever.
An unresponding ill-will everywhere opposes the operations of the government.
The inevitable influence of foreign courts is no less active for being more hidden, and no less baneful.
You could never have imagined some of the excesses committed by hypocritical counter-revolutionaries in order to blight the cause of the revolution.
This rumor was spread particularly through the former province of Brittany and in the departments of the Rhine and the Moselle.
It is one of the crimes imputed to the former public prosecutor of the criminal court of Strasbourg.
That man’s tyrannical follies make everything that has been said of Caligula and Heliogabalus credible; one can scarcely believe it, despite the evidence.
He pushed his delirium to the point of commandeering women for his own use we are told that he even employed that method in selecting a wife.
Such an internal situation ought to seem to you worthy of all your attention, above all if you reflect that at the same time you have the tyrants of Europe to combat, a million and two hundred thousand men under arms to maintain, and that the government is obliged continually to repair, with energy and vigilance, all the injuries which the innumerable multitude of our enemies has prepared for us during the course of five years.
We know no other than the development of that general motive force of the Republic virtue.
The double task of the moderates and the false revolutionaries is to toss us back and forth perpetually between these two perils.
But the people’s representatives can avoid them both, because government is always the master at being just and wise; and, when it has that character, it is sure of the confidence of the people.
It is indeed true that the goal of all our enemies is to dissolve the Convention.
We are beginning a solemn debate upon all the objects of its anxiety, and everything that can influence the progress of the revolution.
We adjure it not to permit any particular hidden interest to usurp ascendancy here over the general will of the assembly and the indestructible power of reason.
The British, who had led the defense against his final invasion, chose St.
Helena in the South Atlantic as a permanent home for the exiled Emperor.
Napoleon was transported to the island, which was administered by the East India Company, in 1815 and lived there for the rest of his life.
At the Congress of Vienna, which ran from November 1814 through June 1815, the old ruling families of Europe got together to try to restore what they thought of as peace and order.
The brother of the executed King, Louis XVI, took the French throne as Louis XVIII (the XVIIth Louis had been the dead king’s son, who had died in prison at the age of 10 in 1795); the restored king agreed to return the territories Napoleon had conquered to the nations that had held them previously.
Beginning in 1838, “Chartists” in Great Britain demanded an extension of suffrage to all men over 21, along with other political reforms.
In addition to throwing rocks, apparently the Chartists also launched the occasional cat at the club-wielding bobbies.
Liberals tried to distance themselves from the social leveling and economic redistribution the Jacobins had attempted, identifying instead with ideas like free trade and a limited franchise.
But radicals pushed for greater equality and more rights for regular people.
For instance, British workers agitated for the right to vote and for a social contract called the People’s Charter in the 1830s and 40s, but conservative Tories blocked the Chartists.
Enlightenment-inspired ideas about democracy, popular sovereignty, and new ideas like socialism all came to a head in Europe by 1848, which was known as the Year of Revolutions.
Potatoes had proved to be an ideal crop for Ireland, and it produced enough of the crop for itself and most of the rest of British Isles—losing this important food source was disastrous for the Irish peasants.
British government aid proved incompetent and ineffective, revealing a scandalous level of prejudice against the Catholic Irish, the first colonized people of the British Crown An image of the Irish Famine published in Ra ; 1849 in the Illustrated London News.
Food shortages spread to Scotland and central Europe, where the Czech potato harvest was also reduced by half because of the blight.
In addition to rural famines, a lot of Britain and parts of Europe had begun to industrialize, and poor urban workers were dissatisfied with their wages and living conditions, which will be described below.
In 1848, rebels temporarily took control of Vienna and forced the Austro-Hungarian Empire to end serfdom.
Southern Italians revolted against the French still occupying their homeland.
And a revolution in France ended the monarchy once again and created the Second French Republic.
But beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, immigration from Europe exploded, and the United States became a “safety valve” for the underemployed, politically marginalized, and persecuted of Europe.
The Irish in the 1840s were followed by Germans after 1848, who remain the largest single immigrant group.
Scandinavians began arriving after the Civil War, and but by the 1890s, most new immigrants came from southern Europe and from eastern Europe—including large numbers of persecuted Jews from the Russian Empire.
By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Americans were of German ethnicity.
These 22 million people are probably mostly of English or Scotch-Irish descent, based on the history of the region.
Statewide, the German pluralities range from 11% in Florida to 48% in North Dakota, which explains why the capital is named after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.
The Industrial Revolution Social changes in Europe and America are a direct result of the Industrial Revolution — as are many of the changes in the less developed world we will discuss in a later chapter.
So before we look at the rest of the world, let’s look more closely at industrialization.
The last two hundred years of human history is also the story of the Industrial Revolution and its affects.
Consider how many of you may be reading this on a hand-held electronic device, which were not all that common even ten years ago.
By the late 1700s, Great Britain had all of these and became the birthplace of the industrial revolution.
Capital—wealth that is invested to create more wealth—was_ available to merchants and others who benefitted from world trade.
Furthermore, the East India Company was also a source of capital through their trade with South Asia in tea and textiles.
The Company also was the model for a successful joint-stock company, in which individual investors purchased shares, which spread ownership and limited financial liability, allowing for greater risk-taking.
Soon, factories would be following the same joint-stock model in order to accumulate the necessary capital for investment.
New technology also made mass production possible, which first occurred in the British textile industry.
The spinning jenny and power looms increased the efficiency of spinning wool and cotton, and then weaving the thread and yarn into cloth.
From this beginning, inventors began seeing the possibilities of mechanical production in other areas such as processed foods, clothing, paper, and household items.
Even today, countries usually begin on the path to industrialization through the textile and processed food industries.
Like flour mills, textile mills initially used the power of rivers to spin water wheels and turbines connected to spinning and weaving machines.
Later, the development of an efficient coal-fired steam engine by Scottish the engineer James Watt made it possible to locate factories closer to cities, transportation hubs, workers, and consumers.
Both water and coal are still important sources of energy throughout the world.
Agricultural improvements in the previous century and the introduction of new staple crops like the potato, imported from the Americas, produced more food using less labor.
Improved nutrition allowed Britain’s population to grow, increasing the number of people available for work in the factories.
With a larger population involved in a wage economy, producing goods for others and not for themselves, Great Britain also created consumers for the textiles, foods, and other products manufactured in new factories.
Soon, British merchants were selling industrial products to Continental Europe and to an increasingly important market of consumers in Britain’s colonies.
The ability to sell manufactured goods to a “captive” colonial market added to the rush for overseas empires by the European powers, the United States, and Japan in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Every nation wanted consumers for the products of the “home country” and wanted to lock up the valuable natural resources needed by the industries of the empire.
In early America, for clothing. example, a regular part of women’s work was spinning thread and yarn from wool, flax, or cotton at home, then weaving cloth and making “homespun” clothing for their families.
As soon as they were able to buy cloth from textile mills, women took advantage of the opportunity to devote much more of their time to other tasks around the farmstead.
Pins were an example of a manufactured product farm families needed that could not be made on the farm.
Pins and other such necessities were usually supplied by peddlers who walked across the countryside in the days before easy access to stores, and then later by general storekeepers.
The other side of handicraft manufacture, though, was the type of work done by the Huguenot weavers—descendants of refugee French Protestants—in East London.
This was a whole community of people who specialized in weaving using tools and | uddites breaking a jacquard loom. techniques that were available before the advent of large-scale textile mills.
Governments were quick to crack down on Luddites — a couple of executions quickly took the wind out of their sails.
As mentioned above, industrialization was possible because farms were producing high yields in the early 19th century, creating both an available workforce and a consumer market for many of the products of early industry.
In addition, nations like Britain with colonies had another lucrative market for manufactures.
Britain also cultivated trade relationships with other new nations like those of Latin America.
British representatives like the envoy sent to Simon Bolivar’s Congress of the Americas worked hard to convince these new nations not to go to the expense of trying to develop their own industries but instead to ship raw materials to Britain in exchange for cheap consumer goods from British factories.
Official British trade missions argued the benefits of “free trade” now that Britain’s manufacturers had gained the advantage in producing low-cost goods.
But the devotion to free markets championed by Adam Smith and his disciples was new-found.
When inexpensive cotton calicoes from India in the 1720s had begun to be preferred for making English clothing, the domestic wool industry had Portrait of Adam Smith, 1790 pressured Parliament into passing the Calico Acts to prohibit their import.
But later, when the British textile industry began using technology that gave Britain an advantage in cotton cloth production, the government did not consider the complaints of the East London weavers, and even took steps to protect trade secrets and prevent too rapid a technology transfer to help British industry profit on its innovations.
Britain began producing cotton cloth even more inexpensively than India—and suddenly the British began preaching about “free trade” and pushing to erase any tariffs or regulations that might prevent British textiles from dominating world markets.
The governments of Continental Europe and the United States quickly tired of simply being a source of raw materials for British factories and a market for British goods.
To support economic development, these governments began taxing imports with tariffs to protect emerging industries from a flood of British manufactured goods.
Tariffs increased the price of imports to consumers, encouraging them to buy the nowcompetitive domestically-produced goods.
Protection from foreign competition has helped many fledgling industries get off the ground in developing nations.
Governments that choose to constantly raise tariffs run the risk of subsidizing their industries’ inefficiencies and reducing the welfare of their consumers as industrial improvements in other countries lower the price of imported products.
This description actually misses a whole generation of innovation and growth when textile mills were powered by water.
The Scottish textile factories of New Lanark, for example, were begun in 1786 by David Dale using water-power technology developed by Richard Arkwright in the 1770s.
New Lanark was built on the Clyde River in Scotland, and all of its machines were powered by the river until the mills closed in 1968.
The American textile mills in New England that dominated the world market in the second half of the 19th century also used water power.
The men who started the Boston Manufacturing Company, that built the cities of Lowell and Lawrence in Massachusetts to take advantage of the water power of the Merrimack River, visited New Lanark in 1811 to learn the technology before they began their venture.
Sensitive to the negative social changes that industrial growth had brought to other parts of Britain, Owen built schools for the children of his workers and social organizations for the families.
He put an end to the long-standing custom of forcing workers to buy only from the company store and tried to make New Lanark a real, living town.
Owen’s partners had objected to his philanthropy, claiming that healthy, happy, well-educated workers did not really boost the bottom line.
The initial expansion of transportation networks for massproduction industries was also water-based.
In industrializing countries, canal-building became a craze from the 1820s through the 1840s.
Many local canals connected newlyestablished towns and villages to markets all over the United States, Great Britain, and continental Europe.
As agricultural goods shipped down the Canal eventually made their way to markets in industrializing East Coast cities, pioneers established farms all along the Canal, and the Erie Canal was key to the western settlement and expansion of the United States, especially before 1865.
Canal laborers were frequently Irish immigrants, who often settled nearby, once the canal was built.
Steam power soon became extremely important in transportation, as well.
Until steam engines were put on riverboats, shipping had depended on either wind and river currents or on human and animal power on canal towpaths.
Goods could easily be floated south from farms on America’s rivers for example, but it was much more difficult and expensive to ship products against the currents to the frontier.
Flatboats and rafts accumulated at downstream ports such as New Orleans and were often broken down and burned as firewood.
Ocean-going steamships made travel and shipping quicker and safer and allowed travelers and merchants to keep to regular schedules.
The first steam patent was granted to a Spanish inventor named Jeronimo Beaumont in 1606, whose engine drove a pump used to drain mines.
River. visiting the Royal Society in London and_ Englishman James Watt’s 1781 engine was the first to produce rotary power that could be adapted to drive mills, wheels, and propellers.
Robert Fulton, an American inventor who had previously patented a canal-dredging machine, visited Paris and caught steam fever.
Fulton sailed an experimental steamboat model on the Seine, and then returned home and launched the first commercial American steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807.
In 1811, Fulton built the New Orleans in Pittsburgh and began regular steamboat service on the Mississippi.
The other transportation technology enabled by steam power, of course, was the railroad, which was even more revolutionary than the steamboat.
In spite of their power and speed, steampowered riverboats depended on rivers or occasionally on canals to run, but a railroad could be built almost anywhere.
Suddenly, the expansion of commerce was no longer limited by the routes nature had provided into the frontier.
The first railroads in the United States had actually been built on the East Coast before a steam engine was available to power them.
Trains of cars pulled by horses looked a lot {#51 ewan isatonota like stage-coaches on rails.
But after Englishman George Stephenson’s locomotives began pulling passengers and freight in northwestern England in the mid-1820s, Americans quickly switched to steam.
The first locomotive used to pull cars in the United States was the Tom Thumb, built in 1880 for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
Although Tom Thumb lost its maiden race against a horse-drawn train, Baltimore and Ohio owners were convinced by the demonstration of steam technology and committed to developing steam locomotives.
The B&O railroad, which had been established in 1827 to compete with the Erie Canal, already advertised itself as a faster way to move people and freight from the interior to the coast.
Factories housed machinery that was too large or too expensive to be used in home production, or that used power sources like steam or water power that weren’t available to small-scale producers.
And often, although it took fewer people to weave a given amount of cloth using the new technology, the new industries were usually producing products for much larger (sometimes even global) markets.
So much cloth was made in the new industrial textile centers like New Lanark in Scotland or Lowell in America that there were often a lot of new jobs — sometimes more than had previously been available in that region.
The new factory jobs required less skill than artisanal craftwork, especially when the worker was making a larger number of standardized products.
Previously, a carpenter needed to be a skilled craftsman to design and assemble a custom-built chair, but with industrialization, a less-skilled lathe operator could turn large quantities of legs that could be assembled into any number of chairs of a standard pattern.
Workers doing lower-skilled jobs became as standardized as the things they made, and could be employed at a much lower cost.
While more people might be working in a new factory compared to an old-fashioned craft workshop, each worker’s wages would almost always be lower.
It was no longer a slow organic process where an apprentice became a master craftsman, developed a clientele, opened his own business, then hired a few workers or apprentices of his own.
The people who started factories were often not even experts at the process they were going to do — they were capitalists and investors who had access to the large sums of money needed to erect a factory and fill it with technology and workers.
A class of owners grew, who had little or no connection to the workers they employed.
Smarvann— “First cotton gin” from Harpers Weekly.69 illustration depicting the cotton gin’s first use 70 years earlier.
American inventor Eli Whitney is remembered for the cotton gin, which removed the seeds from cotton fiber much more quickly than they could be picked out by hand.
The cotton gin helped propel the American South into world leadership in raw cotton.
By the 1850s, American plantations supplied 80 to 90% of the world cotton market.
But Whitney’s most important contribution to industrialization was his technique for using machine tools to produce interchangeable parts for firearms.
With Whitney’s standardized, machined parts, it no longer took a skilled gunsmith to build a weapon.
Anybody with basic skills could assemble and also disassemble, repair, and maintain a rifle or handgun.
Weapons became more reliable and the technique was quickly applied to other industries.
Of course, since most of the intelligence in the job had been moved into the machine, the machine gradually became more valuable and the machine operator less.
Whitney’s process made guns more reliable and less expensive, but he turned not only the gun parts into interchangeable parts, but also the factory employees themselves.
Addressing the Negative Effects of Industrialization Although it produced quality products at low prices for a growing consumer market, industrialization disrupted the lives of workers.
Since jobs were in factory towns and cities, people moved from rural areas to growing metropolitan areas.
Additionally, people were cut off from communities in which they had lived for generations, and forced to find new social relations—or fall into lonely and desperate lives.
Although jobs were the attraction for the new migrants, there was no guarantee of permanent positions in the new economy.
Families were disrupted by unemployment, while traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity could be challenged when the male breadwinner was replaced by a spouse or daughter as the main source of family income, leading to violence, alcoholism and abandonment of the family by men.
Inadequate housing, sanitation, and transportation contributed to environment degradation and psychological stress.
Many intellectuals took up the challenge of rethinking how to make society more just for industrial workers.
While the United States War of Independence had inspired discussion of governments formed by “we, the people,” and the French Revolution had spread the idea of legal equality of all citizens under law, a new understanding of capital and labor seemed to be needed.
Workers in the new industries provided all of the labor at low wages and in dangerous conditions, while often absentee owners and investors reaped the profits.
A number of industrialists such as Robert Owen tried to make their factories more humane, embracing the cooperative movement and even improving workers’ welfare with schools for their children and social gatherings.
However, many business owners did not see their responsibility to workers extending beyond providing a wage for the work they performed.
Karl Marx, a German philosopher, criticized the growth of capitalism and industrialization, and brought a new analysis to economic thinking.
According to Marx, this last battle was between the more numerous workers, whom he called the proletariat and the industrial capitalists, the bourgeoisie.
Marx believed the proletariat would inevitably defeat the bourgeoisie, seize the factories, and create a socialist utopia.
After the final battle, Marx predicted a world where the workers or their government controlled the “means of production”, the factories and farms.
Instead of religion, which Marx said was “the opiate of the people”, workers would develop a “class consciousness” that would help extend the worldwide proletarian revolution.
Marx imagined a global working class that transcended nations, races, and ethnic groups—his vision was for an international dictatorship of the proletariat, where all workers would unite regardless of ethnicity, language, religion, or any of the identities that had prevented European nations from forming a lasting empire.
Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, published their ideas in the Communist Manifesto in February, 1848, just as Europe entered a year of attempted revolutions.
Since these upheavals did not bring the promised dictatorship of the proletariat, Marx continued to publish his theories and predictions, and organized the first Marxist socialist parties.
Even so, by the time of Marx’s death, his ideas and other forms of socialism were motivating labor organizers to form unions in which workers could negotiate for better wages and working conditions with owners, under threat of striking—stopping work at a factory and preventing others from replacing them at the machines.
Socialism and communism, and their influence in governments and labor relations, will be examined more fully in later chapters.
Fertilizer As mentioned previously, industrialization depends on a stable foundation of agriculture to provide enough food for workers to increase the population and provide enough food for people to eat.
As farming becomes more efficient, not everyone needs to focus on subsistence and workers are available to move to cities and take jobs in factories.
The remaining farms become bigger and take on the responsibility of feeding the growing urban populations.
Earlier agricultural societies in Europe had depended on crop rotation to rebuild soils after periods of intensive planting.
But as farmers saw an opportunity to earn money in the market, feeding urban industrial workers, some were unwilling to accept the idea that a significant portion of their farms would be fallow each year.
They preferred to amend their soils rather than waiting for fertility to regenerate naturally.
The first commercial fertilizers were made from guano, the droppings of seabirds living on islands off the western shores of South America.
Guano comes from the Quechua Indian word Wanu, which means any excrement used as a soil additive.
Natives of the Andes have mined guano on the coast and islands for at least 1,500 years, and Spanish colonial records noted that Inca rulers had considered protecting the cormorants that were the main source of guano so important, that disturbing the birds’ nesting areas a capital offense.
Guano was carried from the coast up into the Andes on the backs of llamas, for use on the terraced farms surrounding highland cities like Machu Picchu.
Although surrounded by ocean, the islands off the western coast of South America are arid.
Like the deserts they face on the mainland, some experience no annual rainfall at all.
Seabirds such as cormorants and pelicans have lived on these islands by the millions, for thousands of years.
Over that time, they’ve left literal mountains of droppings, which due to the lack of rain have simply piled up.
The Workers mining guano on a Peruvian guano contains the _ ideal Hera eEY percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to make it an excellent fertilizer without any mixing.
It simply needs to be chopped off the mountain, ground up, and spread on fields.
Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, Europeans and Americans fell on the area in a guano rush, and by the middle of the century several nations had enlisted the work of Chinese peasants in a Pacific labor system that has been compared with the slavery of the Atlantic world.
Although the Chinese workers were technically free, many were debtors who had been tricked into labor contracts promising work in California.
Once they reached the guano islands and realized they had been duped, there was no way off.
Over a hundred thousand Chinese workers were imported to the islands in the second half of the nineteenth century.
Guano was so profitable that the United States Congress passed a Guano Islands Act in 1856.
The law provided an incentive for American sailors to find and claim undefended islands for America by giving the discoverer exclusive rights to the guano recovered.
Islands claimed under the Guano Islands Act include parts of the Hawaiian chain, Midway Atoll, part of American Samoa, and several islands still disputed with Colombia.
The guano islands off the western coast of South America were so valuable that two wars were fought over them.
Chile and Peru fought Spain in the Chincha Islands War, 1864-66, and defeated the Spanish Empire.
Then, once Spain’s claim had been successfully set aside, Chile took many of the guano islands from Peru, along with the nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert, in the War of the Pacific, 1879-838.
After about 1870, guano was overtaken as a source of nitrogen by nitrate-rich desert soils called Caliche.
These soils were discovered in the Atacama desert, a region regarded as the driest place on earth that lay partly in Chile, partly in Peru, and partly in Bolivia.
When all three nations rushed to extract and process the Caliche, Chile challenged its northern rivals for the nitrate fields.
Chile’s victory in the War of the Pacific extended its border northwards to encompass. the Atacama _ desert, including all the coastal territory that had belonged to Bolivia.
Many ethnic Bolivians living around the port city of Arica still dream of throwing off the Chilean yoke and _ winning. their country access to the Pacific again.
The nitrate Chile monopolized was valuable both as a fertilizer and as a key ingredient in explosives and munitions.
But mining and processing nitrate from Chile’s desert soil required much more capital than digging guano.
Chile attracted British investors, and soon joint ventures began shipping a million tons of nitrate per year out of the South American desert.
Production grew steadily until 1914, when World War I created new incentives for Britain’s enemies to find an alternative to Caliche nitrate.
We will discuss this shift to an economic form of imperialism, by European nations, Britain, and even the United States, in the next chapter.
The new Qing emperors reinvigorated the Confucian ruling class, and China once again enjoyed a high degree of social stability, economic prosperity, and international trade.
By the mid-1700s, the British East India Company dominated trade and the administration of India.
British ships carried Indian cloth and other products to the rest of the world; the tea dumped in Boston Harbor in 1778 came from India.
The East India Company was very interested in opening up Chinese markets to trade, but China was self-sufficient and uninterested in anything the British had to offer.
Chinese teas, jade, silks and porcelain were in high demand in the West, but the only payment China would accept was silver.
For centuries the silver of the New World had been making its way into the Chinese economy, where it became the money supply of the world’s largest economy.
The East India Company’s supply of silver was limited. 19th-century western illustration of Chinese opium smokers.
Although the Qing had outlawed opium imports in 1729, the East India Company controlled a virtually unlimited supply.
At the beginning of the 19th century an annual average of 4,500 trunks of opium were reaching smugglers on the South China coast.
China rapidly shifted from being a magnet for silver with a huge trade surplus to a net importer whose treasuries were rapidly dwindling.
Some Chinese officials wanted to legalize opium so the empire could tax it, but Confucian moralists won the policy debate.
In 1839, the emperor sent one of China’s most distinguished officials, Lin Zexu, to the trading settlement of Canton to stamp out the opium trade.
Lin blockaded the European trading district, raided and searched the foreigners’ warehouses, confiscated 20,000 chests containing 1200 tons of opium, and Commissioner Lin Zexu, dubbed “Lin of dumped it all into the ocean.
The East India Company complained about its losses in London, and Queen Victoria sent a fleet including four steampowered battleships.
Lightly-armored Chinese war junks, designed to fight river pirates, were severely outgunned.
The limited range of Qing cannon compared to British artillery allowed the invaders to pummel Chinese defenses from a safe distance.
The Treaty of Nanking (called the “Unequal Treaty” by the Chinese) opened five Chinese ports to European traders, gave the British the island of Hong Kong, and required China to establish diplomatic relations with Great Britain as an equal power rather than continuing to treat all foreigners as barbarians unworthy of official notice.
China’s embarrassing defeat by the British was followed by another defeat in the Second Opium War that resulted in another unequal treaty giving access to French and Russian merchants.
By the 1890s, 90 ports of call were available to more than 300,000 European and American traders, diplomats, and missionaries.
Armored, steam-powered British warships were able to easily destroy Chinese junks built for coastal defense.
The weakness of the Qing empire against foreign aggression was exacerbated by the ongoing opium crisis and by crumbling infrastructure and famine in the countryside.
A series of peasant revolts swept through south China in the 1850s and 1860s, most notably the Taiping Rebellion which killed 30 million people over a fifteen-year period.
The leader of the rebellion was Hong Xiuquan, a young man who had become unhinged after failing the grueling civil service exam four times.
Hong had a vision and declared he was the little brother of Christ who had been sent to China to rid the land of the Manchu foreigners and their Confucianist culture.
When Hong captured Nanjing and in 1853 made it the capital of the Taiping, he first killed all the Manchu men and then marched the women outside the city and burned them to death.
Hong’s brutality and his strange interpretation of Christianity may have alienated some Europeans, but his ban on opium use antagonized more.
Europe and Britain threw their support behind the Qing dynasty they had just defeated in the Opium Wars.
Hong and his allies were unable to avoid the temptation to quarrel and plot against each other, which weakened their leadership.
Two Taiping attempts to take Shanghai in 1860 and 1862 were repelled with British and French assistance.
In 1864, the Qing and their European allies retook Nanjing and ended the regime, but the resistance continued until 1871, when the last Taiping army was completely wiped out by government forces.
The Japanese home islands have been united under the same imperial dynasty since the 5th century CE; the current emperor comes from the longest line of any monarch in the world.
As an independent island nation, the Japanese were able to selectively accept or reject ideas and innovations from China, the powerful empire to the west.
Often they would modify and incorporate aspects of Chinese culture, like writing and Buddhism, to their own circumstances, Native Japanese Shinto religion, for instance, embraces the teachings of Buddha.
Beginning in the late 1100s, the emperor ruled indirectly, ceding power to Shoguns, who commanded an army of lesser nobles known as samurai.
The Shoguns held back invasions by Mongol armies in the 1200s and maintained a large degree of separation for the empire from outside religions and cultures.
This self-isolation ended in the mid-19th century, when the United States, which had been largely shut out of Europeandominated China, decided to try and open trade with Japan.
American Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay in July 1853 with a squadron of four warships and threatened to open fire on the capital if the Japanese refused to negotiate.
Three years later a “Treaty of Amity and Commerce” was signed, offered to the Japanese by American diplomats as a less-invasive alternative to the aggressive colonialism of Britain and France in China following the Opium War.
Modernization and the embrace of new technology went hand in hand with reorganization of the national government in what became known as the Meiji Restoration.
The 15th Tokugawa shogun resigned in November 1867 and direct control of government was restored to the Emperor Meiji.
The samurai class (which numbered nearly 2 million) was slowly disbanded and a nationwide universal military draft was instituted in 1873.
The industrialization of Japan accelerated, building the strong nation we will see taking its place on the world stage in the next chapter.
Satirical drawing in the magazine Punch , showing the victory of “small” Japan over “large” China.
Meanwhile, in China, other rebellions such as the Nian Rebellion , the Panthay Rebellion , and the Dungan revolt continued to challenge the Qing regime.
In 1895, China lost its control of its tribute state Korea to Japan in the first Sino-Japanese War.
The humiliating defeat for the Qing empire showed their efforts to modernize China’s military had failed and was a catalyst for a series of political actions led by revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen.
Delighted did we feel that the kings of your honorable nation so clearly understood the great principles of propriety, and were so deeply grateful for the heavenly goodness (of our emperor):—therefore, it was that we of the heavenly dynasty nourished and cherished your people from afar, and bestowed upon them redoubled proofs of our urbanity and kindness.
But, during the commercial intercourse which has existed so long, among the numerous foreign merchants resorting hither, are wheat and tares, good and bad; and of these latter are some, who, by means of introducing opium by stealth, have seduced our Chinese people, and caused every province of the land to overflow with that poison.
Every native of the Inner Land who sells opium, as also all who smoke it, are alike adjudged to death.
Your honorable nation takes away the products of our central land, and not only do you thereby obtain food and support for yourselves, but moreover, by re-selling these products to other countries you reap a threefold profit.
Still we cannot bear to slay or exterminate without previous warning, and it is for this reason that we now clearly make known to you the fixed laws of our land.
Let then your highness punish those of your subjects who may be criminal, do not endeavor to screen or conceal them, and thus you will secure peace and quietness to your possessions, thus will you more than ever display a proper sense of respect and obedience, and thus may we unitedly enjoy the common blessings of peace and happiness.
Let your highness immediately, upon the receipt of this communication, inform us promptly of the state of matters, and of the measure you are pursuing utterly to put a stop to the opium evil.
These laborers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.
Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman.
He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him.
Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race.
But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production.
In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.
Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist.
Masses of laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers.
As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants.
Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself.
The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.
The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women.
Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class.
All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

The 19th century and the turn of the 20th century are often described as a period when the power of many land-based empires diminished and nationalism became the most important organizing principle for societies around the world.
Actually, powerful nations in Europe and America pursued overseas empires and expanded into Africa and East Asia, until a wave of “decolonization” after World War Two.
Consider the decline of the empires we’ve already become familiar with in earlier chapters, in Asia, Europe, and the Muslim world.
They were territorial empires that had used military conquest to impose political control over wide expanses of land adjacent to their ancestral homelands.
They existed by providing a degree of civil and economic order, in exchange for taxes on the agricultural produce of the agrarian populations they conquered.
These empires usually left their citizens more or less alone to speak their own languages, practice their own religions, and observe their own cultural traditions.
Occasionally they took captives from conquered lands, like the janissaries of the Ottoman Empire.
In the process, the Spanish defeated several land-based indigenous empires such as the Aztecs, Inca, and Maya, and replaced the native rulers with Spanish Viceroys.
The British, French, Dutch, and others soon followed the Iberians into the Caribbean and North America.
All the European colonies in the Americas were controlled by their respective “mother” countries, sending resources like silver and gold and agricultural products to Europe, and often required to trade only with the “mother” economy.
However, the new project of economic “neo-imperialism” also appeared in the 19th century, especially in the new republics of Latin America.
In this case, supposedly independent countries that had recently won their independence from the Spanish and Portuguese empires, were economically dominated by European and United States investors, still providing raw materials for the “Great Powers” in exchange for finished industrial goods.
As presented later, nearly all of these new nations became indebted to European banks and faced the humiliation of “gunboat diplomacy” in which United States and European powers took over custom houses to force payment of loans.
Before World War One, the decline of land-based empires was nearly complete, while overseas empires flourished.
Declining Land-Based Empires The land-based empires began a precipitous decline after the Napoleonic wars, some sooner than others.
Members of distinct cultural, religious, and linguistic groups began to demand more autonomy within these empires, which frequently led to the establishment of independent nationstates.
In other cases, empires that resisted change were conquered by powerful nations expanding their overseas empires.
LY Temtitory lost before 1683 [J vassal territory lost before 1683 ee 4 UL K ‘ } S The Ottoman Empire declined very slowly during the 19th century—when it was called “the Sick Man of Europe”—but it was able to persist until World War I The Sunni Muslim Ottoman homeland was present-day Turkey, which bordered on Orthodox Christian Russia to the north, the Catholic Habsburg Empire to the west, and the Shiite Iranians who succeeded the Safavid Empire in Persia to the east.
The Russians aided the Orthodox Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians in their successful struggles for independence.
The Ottoman capital, Istanbul, had been Constantinople, home of the Byzantine Empire and of Greek Orthodox Christianity before the Ottoman conquest of 1458; and the leaders of Russia wanted to reestablish Christian rule there.
The Greeks were the first to successfully free themselves from Ottoman rule in the 1820s.
They found support not only from Imperial Russia, but also from the British and French, who sought more economic and political influence in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The struggle for Greek freedom, in the birthplace of democracy and and home of classical literature and art, fired the imagination of the artists and writers of the “Romantic” movement then flourishing in Europe.
By the mid-19th century, disputes between European powers over what would happen to Ottoman territory caused the Crimean War , in which France, Great Britain, the Italian Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Ottomans opposed an expanding Russian Empire.
The Crimean War was the first major war of the Industrial Age, featuring the use of railways, telegraphs, and modern ordnance like rifles and exploding naval artillery.
The poem describes a frontal assault by a British light cavalry unit armed only with lances and sabers against an artillery battery dug in on high ground at the battle of Balaclava in 1855.
Although Tennyson’s poem praises the bravery of the cavalrymen who charged through the so-called Valley of Death, events like these became symbols of the logistical and tactical mismanagement of the war effort.
The conflict also revealed the weakness of the Russian Empire, which fielded large armies but lagged in both tactics and technology.
In the treaty following the war, Russia was forced to remove its naval fleet from the Black Sea.
Ali modernized Egypt in many ways, while his son, Muhammad Sa’id, granted a land concession in 1854 to French businessman Ferdinand de Lesseps to dig a canal from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.
The building of the Suez Canal, completed in 1869, was initially opposed by Great Britain because they feared its control by the French would shift the balance of power in Europe.
The canal _ took NASA image of the Suez Canal from space, connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the eleven years to build, using Red Sea. forced Egyptian labor.
Although the Suez Canal Company was an international corporation, its shares did not sell well outside France and Egypt.
But in 1875, Sa’id’s son Ismail put Egypt’s shares up for sale and British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli bought the shares with an unsecured £4,000,000 loan from his close personal friend Baron Lionel de Rothschild, head of the famous international bank.
Although France still owned more shares, Britain sent troops to protect the canal during an Egyptian civil war in 1882 and in 1888 the canal was declared a neutral zone under British protection.
Using the canal, British steamships were able to avoid sailing around Africa and reach India in two weeks instead of two months.
Although they belonged to distinct ethnic and linguistic groups, the majority of people in these territories were Orthodox Christians.
When the Russian Empire’s ambitions were thwarted in the Crimean War, Russians were forced to confront their military incompetence and social backwardness.
Serfdom tied peasants and their families to the land, and although they were not slaves, serfs were included in any property transaction among the landed gentry.
Tsar Alexander II declared an end to serfdom in 1861, shortly before President Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, during the United States Civil War.
Both countries were among the last in their respective regions to formally end forced labor obligations and like the newly-“freed” in the U.S., the liberty of many former Russian serfs existed only on paper.
However, the slowness of political and social change led to frustration among potential reformers, who instead turned to revolutionary action, often led by anarchists.
Anarchism is similar to socialism in its concept of class struggle, but anarchists believe that all forms of top-down control—governments, police, organized religion—should be immediately eliminated, allowing the natural cooperativeness of humanity to thrive in smaller consensus-based entities.
His son, Alexander III, rejected this political reform; he, in turn, was also murdered by anarchists, in 1894.
His son, Nicholas II, was not open to any checks on his absolute power.
Dozens of ethnic and religious groups lived in the territories of the Russian Empire; attempts at “russification” were inconclusive.

Jews from these Russia and Eastern Europe also often chose a new life in the United States rather than discrimination and persecution.
Later pogroms, such as one in Odessa in 1905 in which hundreds of Jews lost their lives, received international condemnation and were presented as proof of Tsarist Russia’s backwardness.
Although Jews had lived in the region for centuries, they were always considered an “other” and the Tsars restricted their ability to own land and to exercise certain professions.
Attacks on Jewish communities and neighborhoods—pogroms—occurred with frightening frequency from the 1880s until the eve of World War One.
Jews from these territories often chose immigration to the United States to flee discrimination and persecution, while later pogroms, such as the one in Odessa in 1905 in which hundreds of Jews lost their lives, received international condemnation and were presented as proof of Tsarist Russia’s backwardness.
The Spanish line died out in 1700, but the Austrian House of Habsburg would reign until 1918.
At the end of the Napoleonic period, the Habsburg Empire dominated southeastern Europe, up to the frontiers of the Ottoman and Russians.
While the Tsars felt a special kinship with Orthodox Christians under Turkish rule—Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians—the Habsburg monarchs supported Catholics of the Ottoman region, like the Croats.
Until 1815, the Habsburgs had been the Holy Roman Emperors; during the Protestant Reformation, they fought to maintain Catholicism as the official religion of their realm.
Although united by religion, the Habsburg empire was divided by a growing sense of nationality.
German-speaking Austrian Habsburg emperors ruled Hungarians, Czechs, Ukrainians, Poles, Slovaks, Romanians, Jews, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, and Albanians.
By the middle of the nineteenth century, many of these peoples wanted their own nations.
The rebellions and revolutions of 1848 came close to breaking up the Habsburg territories in a wave of nationalist and socialist fervor.
The revolutionaries did not achieve all of their goals, but serfdom was abolished, several regions gained a greater degree of autonomy, and Emperor Ferdinand I abdicated in favor of his nephew Franz Josef.
Unification of Italy in the 1860s and and Germany in 1870 allowed the Hungarians, who became the most numerous minority within the realm, to achieve nearcomplete independence.
Sse tan Sere 8 the Austro-Hungarian Ethnicities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire Empire.
Romanians demanded more autonomy from the Hungarian administration in Budapest, while the Czechs asked for the same from the Austrian government in Vienna.
A united Germany, achieved in 1870, brought together an agricultural east with an industrialized west, creating an entirely new “Great Power” in Europe to rival Great Britain and France.
The new nation called itself the German Empire (Deutsches Reich); its ambition to take a place at the table of imperial powers upset the post-Napoleonic European balance of power and, eventually, became a cause of the two twentieth-century world wars.
Although he was not among the young Germans who had dreamed of unification during the revolutions of 1848, Bismarck gradually came to the conclusion that to counter Austria-Hungary, which was over-extended in Italy and in its ambitions in the Balkans, Prussia had to take the initiative and gather the German states under the Prussian king.
First, in 1864, he started a brief war with Denmark that brought together most of the northern German states as allies of Prussia.
A war with Austria in 1866 solidified these states in a confederation with Prussian King Wilhelm I, while at the same time, the newly unified Italy took advantage of a weakened Austria to claim Italian-speaking Hapsburg territories.
When the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been president of France before declaring himself emperor, went to war with Prussia in 1870, he counted on the neutrality of the other German states and on Austrian help, neither of which happened.
Prussia had one of the best-trained armies in Europe and surprised the French with their rapid advance.
A leaderless France could not halt the united German advance and the capital, Paris, was taken over by a socialist-inspired Commune.
The French agreed to territorial losses as they formed a Third Republic Otto von Bismarck, painted when he was Prime Minister of Prussia.
In early 1871, Bismarck initiated a gathering of the German princes at the French royal palace in Versailles, outside Paris, to join together as a new unified national state, with the Prussian King Wilhelm I as emperor.
The man in white is the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck, responsible for organizing the Empire.
A German empire created a new dynamic in diplomatic relations, based on French and German antagonism, forming new alliances and altering previous arrangements.
The FrancoPrussian War was the first of three major conflicts between the French and the Germans over the next 75 years in which millions would die—but one can take heart in the idea that in more recent decades, the two countries have become strong allies, forming the primary economic and political relationship of the current European Union.
If the French and Germans can set aside old conflicts and work together, perhaps Indians and Pakistanis, Sunnis and Shiites, Israelis and Palestinians, and other “enemies” can eventually do the same.
Rising Overseas Empires Even though the British North American colonies achieved independence and became the United States, Britain held on to Canada and retained control of islands in the Caribbean, while London’s bankers and British industry would dominate the finance and trade in the new Latin American republics.
Unlike the Thirteen Colonies, Canada achieved its independence from Britain much more slowly, without a revolution.
Although the French-speaking Quebecois and the British in Ontario could easily have been at each other’s throats, anxiety over an invasion from the United States (which was _ tried unsuccessfully in 1775 and 1812) held a fragile alliance together.
After two more incursions by American forces in the 1830s, the British Sir John A Macdonald, first Prime Minister North America Act of 1867 of Canada . created the Dominion of Canada by combining Quebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and New Brunswick.
MacDonald knew that like the U.S., Canada’s eastern and western coastal regions needed a transcontinental railroad to bind them together.
Railroad operates mostly just north of the border, although several lines connected to United States cities such as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Chicago.
Canadian-Pacific Rail Map The British had also claimed Australia, which they settled in the late 18th century with convicts.
Most of the crimes were petty or related to debt, while some were political, such as the Irish condemned for protesting English rule.
New Zealand was settled in the early 19th century through a private company, following the model established in the colonization of some of the Thirteen Colonies.
In both cases, the native peoples lost land in much the same manner as in British North America.
In Australia, the vast continent allowed for the aborigines to retreat, until environmental and other factors brought them into increasing contact with the settlers and their descendants.
India was the most important colony for the British, determining much of its international diplomacy until after World War Two.
When the British East India Company began its conquest of India in the 1700s, the Mughal Empire was entering a long period of decline after its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries.
The Company took advantage of the empire’s weakness to expand its trading activities, and slowly took over the regional principalities that split off from Mughal control.
By the 1700s, Indian tea had become an important part of the British diet—even for their colonists in North America, who dumped Indian tea into the Boston Harbor in protest against taxes on the product in 1778.
By the middle of the 19th century, the Company controlled most of mainland India, Pakistan, Burma, and Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka.
The Company shifted its policy away from simply trading, and began reorganizing the Indian economy, clearing forests and establishing widespread cultivation of tea, coffee, cotton, and opium for use in China.
By the time the Crown took over direct control of the colony in 1858 after an uprising called the Sepoy Mutiny, India was a producer of agricultural products and raw materials for Britain’s growing industrial economy.
This closed economic system was attractive to both older and newer European empires—setting off, as we shall see, a scramble for colonies in Africa in the late-19th century.
The British administration of India, however, also provided a model for other European imperialists.
Clearly, the tiny island kingdom could not direct all of the affairs of their Indian possession—trained locals needed to aid in governance.
This process began under the East India Company with the formation of native army and police forces, commanded by British officers, but soon included educated local administrators who spoke English and understood and applied imperial laws and edicts.
This model proved so effective in India that Indian immigrants often followed the British to their new colonies in Africa, where Indians operated the railways and postal service, and Indian carpenters and bricklayers constructed government offices and private homes for the new colonial political and commercial elites.
Indian shopkeepers played an enormous role in the local economies of these new colonies well into the 20th century.
Indians even migrated to Great Britain’s territories in the Caribbean as indentured servants—in Guyana, in northern South America, over 40% of the population is of “India-Indian” descent.
The story of Mahatma Gandhi, who later helped lead India to independence, is an example of a native trained to manage the Empire.
After an education in a British school in India, Gandhi went to London and studied law.
On graduating he went to South Africa to serve the British Empire as a lawyer for twenty-five years before beginning a new career advocating for Indian independence.
Ho Chi Minh, who would fight with and then against United States forces for the independence of Vietnam, applied for admission to the French academy in Marseilles that trained imperial administrators.
If the school had accepted him, history might have been quite different.

Slavery, Expansion, and Civil War Some of the slaveowners among the Founders of the United States thought that slavery would not be a permanent institution in the new country.
At the constitutional convention in 1787, they agreed to abolish the slave trade in the United States starting in 1808.
Even the slaveowner Thomas Jefferson idealized the independent, self-sufficient yeoman farmer rather than the Southern planter as the hope of American democracy.
However, Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin gave new life to the institution of slavery.
Constitution, in which enslaved people counted as 3/ A time-lapse map of the expansion of slavery in the United States between 1789 5 of a person for purposes of and 1861. taxation and representation, became more divisive rather than gradually disappearing.
Liberia, on west coast of Africa, was “founded” by white abolitionists and free people from the United States in 1820—incongruously naming their capital “Monrovia” for the US. president at the time, James Monroe, who was a slaveholder.
Whitney’s invention caused an explosion of cotton planting, which led not only to an expansion of slavery but to a hunger for new land.
As had happened in the Thirteen Colonies, white-led settlement came at _ the expense of the Native Americans.
The five “civilized A map of the process of Indian Removal, tribes” of the south, the 1830-1838.
Oklahoma is depicted in light Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Moores Chickasaw, and Seminole, were Indians who had embraced Christianity and Anglo-American institutions.
They established their own farms and even plantations, published a bilingual newspaper, governed themselves in a bicameral legislature, and even owned black slaves.
Nevertheless, they were cast out of the southern states by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, forced to leave ancestral lands and relocate in Oklahoma, west of the Mississippi River.
Despite treaties, similar processes also occurred in the Louisiana Territory and beyond.
The territories of independent Mexico north of the Rio Grande River had been only lightly settled by the Spanish.
Santa Fe was established nearly one hundred years after the conquest of the Aztecs, and the religious missions in California only appeared in the 1700s.
The new Mexican government allowed for “Anglo” settlement from the United States into Texas, which bordered the new state General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, of Louisiana, as a way to begin former President of Mexico, led Mexican populating this region.
He returned to x the Presidency during the the Mexican government Mexican-American War, but couldn't allowed the “Tejanos” a prevent his nation’s defeat. degree of self-government, they insisted that Mexican laws be obeyed, including the abolition of slavery.
The new settlers rebelled, and achieved independence after a brief war in 1836, and immediately brought enslaved people to work on cotton plantations.
Although Mexico’s treaty with independent Texas included a pledge that the new republic would not become a state of the United States, Texas did join the union in 1845 and a war ensued.
Not only did the United States government send troops south to defend Texas, they sent enough to defeat Mexico decisively.
Many Americans argued that the United States had a “Manifest Destiny” that required it to become a continental nation.
The United States Army eventually occupied Mexico City in 1848 and conquered all of the territory to the Pacific Ocean.
In defeat, the Mexicans signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and ceded all of their territory north of the Rio Grande River.
At the same time, the United States government negotiated a treaty with Great Britain to establish a border in the disputed Oregon territory.
By 1849, the United States had completed its advance across the continent.

Almost immediately after the Mexicans were defeated, gold was discovered by a US. settler in northern California.
The United States was a “white man’s country”, and they became the first ethnic group explicitly barred from immigrating to the United States in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
And finally, the rapid expansion of territory and establishment of new states upended the careful balance between slave and free states that had prevented armed conflict.
The Civil War, like the Crimean a few years earlier, was one of the first modern wars that brought new technology to the battlefield.
Railroads and steamboats made troop transportation quicker and more efficient, while the electric telegraph not only improved military communication, but also made war news more immediately available to the newspaper-reading public in the United States and abroad.
Southern hopes of maintaining an independent Confederacy depended on support from Europe.
Great Britain hesitated to recognize the independence of the Confederacy, but in the end declined when the Union began racking up victories in 1863.
At the same time, Emperor Napoleon II]—nephew of the man who had sold Louisiana to Jefferson—pursued an imperial scheme to create a pro-French monarchy in Mexico which would support the Confederates.
Napoleon’s plan failed when Mexican troops unexpectedly defeated the French army at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862.
Although Maximilian, brother of the Emperor, would briefly rule Mexico, the project was a disaster for Napoleon.
After the Union victory in the U.S., French troops left Mexico and Maximilian was executed by firing squad in 1867 as Mexican liberals, led by Benito Juarez, reestablished Mexican independence.
The date of the Battle of Puebla is still celebrated as Cinco de Mayo by Mexican-Americans throughout the United States.
Because some United States publishers are interested in selling their textbooks to school boards in the former Confederate States, they often soft-pedal the Civil War in a way that creates confusion.
It is not reasonable to argue that property is a human right, but only for some humans, and that other humans can be property, rather than having property rights.
Although the Confederacy made this claim after they lost, when they seceded and while they thought they were winning, the South very clearly stated it was leaving the Union to preserve the institution of slavery.
Great Britain was particularly interested in an independent Latin America as a source of markets for its industrial products, while English and Irish mercenaries, available after the Napoleonic Wars, joined the fight for freedom alongside Bolivar and others in Latin America.
The new countries of Latin America suffered through a long period of struggle to establish stable governments and thriving economies—which, depending on the country, included civil wars, dictatorships, social and political reforms, and economic dependence on a handful of exports and their international price.
The new countries also were the first to experience neo-imperialism—a “new” imperialism that technically respected national sovereignty, but in reality forced governments to bend to foreign influence.
In the 1820s and 1830s, the new governments of Latin America quickly became indebted to British banks, which had arranged large loans in anticipation that independence would bring rapid economic development as it had in the United States.
Meanwhile, local artisans could not compete with British textiles and other manufactured goods that flooded the markets of the new republics.
Many countries became dependent on _ the Gauchos relaxing in the Argentine Pampas, as a side of beef cooks over the fire. international price of a handful—or even a single—export such as copper and nitrates in Chile, coffee in Brazil, beef and grain in Argentina, sugar in Cuba, and bananas in Central America.
This neo-imperialism continues for much Latin America well into the 2lst century, while the model was extended to new countries formed in Africa and Asia from the declining European empires after World War Two.
Some Latin America countries had more success than others boosting their economies with world trade.
Brazilian plantations still produce more coffee beans than any other country, but in the 19th century, more than half of all coffee came from Brazil.
But the country’s economy was extremely sensitive to the world price and rate of consumption; and when the occasional frost in southern Brazil damaged the coffee bushes, planters could go bankrupt.
Brazil was the last ik dat i i im ul J country in the hemisphere to fll ont "" * abolish slavery, but it achieved this change without a bloody Civil War.
In the 18th century, enslaved labor was drone i Wier watlvedl shifted from declining sugar cane plantations in northern Brazil to silver mining districts in the south.
As the mines were beginning to deplete in the late 18th century, planters discovered The Lei Aurea that ended that coffee grew well in the slavery in Brazil.
By then it had imported an highlands of southern Brazil estimated 4,000,000 slaves from Africa, or , 40% of all slaves shipped to the Americas. and again, the large landowners used_ enslaved labor to cultivate the bean.
The bloody War of the Triple Alliance, in which Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil fought Paraguay over borders from 1866 to 1870, contributed to the end of slavery.
Desperate for soldiers, the Brazilian government offered freedom to enslaved men if they served in the army.
The institution was gradually fading anyway, because coffee cultivation used less labor than either sugar plantations or mines.
By 1880, nearly three quarters of all people of color in Brazil were free.
King Pedro II finally abolished the institution in 1888; a year later, he abdicated and the military organized a republic.
As noted in the last chapter, Chile controlled over 80% of the world’s nitrates in the 1880s, making it a serious power in the Pacific.
After the War of the Pacific, the Chilean Navy controlled the west coast of South America, Central America, and was even a threat to United States interests.
In 1885, when a rebellion broke out in the Colombian province of Panama, the United States government sent ships and troops to both sides of the isthmus to protect the railroad owned by North American investors.
The Chilean government send its British-built armored cruiser Esmeralda to the Pacific side of Panama, to send a message that it would prevent any annexation of the isthmus by the United States Whatever its intentions, the United States government withdrew its navy and troops after the rebellion had calmed, as United States naval observers opined that the mighty Esmeralda could sink every ship in the United States navy at the time.
The incident contributed to the building of a more effective United States navy in the ensuing years.
With the end of slavery, independence inspired Cubans, including a few from the planter class.
Marti died in his first battle, but the independence army continued with guerrilla tactics in their fight against the Spanish.
The Spanish set up concentration camps for non-combatants, assuming that anyone who did not submit was an independence sympathizer.
Major newspapers soon engaged in sensationalist reporting on Spain’s crimes in Cuba in order to increase circulation.
Media magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer used what became known as yellow journalism to agitate for war.
Yellow journalism, named after a popular cartoon character, “Yellow Kid”, is the technique of using inflammatory headlines backed by little or no factual reporting to stir up public emotion, a combination of the click-bait and fake news that is common on the Internet today.
It’s ironic that Pulitzer is now best known for the prize for journalistic excellence he established in his will.
At the beginning of 1898, public opinion in the United States was divided over entering the Cuban war for independence.
United States investors and buyers controlled the all-important sugar industry, they built and owned much of the communications and transportation infrastructure, and United States smokers were the main consumers of Cuban cigars.
The Maine mysteriously blew up in Havana harbor, killing scores of United States soldiers.
President McKinley asked for and the United States Congress granted a declaration of war on Spain.
The conflict quickly eliminated the Spanish Empire’s control of Cuba and Puerto Rico.
Theodore Roosevelt, Secretary of the Navy at the time, formed his own army unit he called the Rough Riders so that he would not miss out on the “splendid little war” in Cuba.
However, Black troops from the regular army had to save him and his men at the Battle of San Juan Hill.
The United States navy sank the Spanish fleet in the Caribbean and in the Philippines, denying any possibility of the arrival of reinforcements and war materiel from Spain.
At the end of 1898, the Spanish Crown agreed to Cuban independence and handed over Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States Cuba Libre was shouted for years by Cuban nationalists.
However, Cuba was far from “free” after the war, since the United States government demanded the right to intercede in the internal affairs of the island for any reason.
The infamous “Platt Amendment” was forced into the constitution of the new Cuban republic, and United States Marines were indeed sent in periodically to change governments or put down rebellions, real or imagined.
United States investors were particularly leery of increased Afro-Cuban participation in politics, projecting their own racism onto the affairs of the island.
Rudyard Kipling’s famous 1899 poem, “The White Man’s Burden,” was written in support of the United States effort to subdue the ungrateful brown people of the Philippines.
The United States Navy destroyed the city of Iloilo to suppress the independence movement, and Aguinaldo called for a strategy of guerrilla warfare.,200 American soldiers were killed in the conflict and about 250,000 Filipino soldiers and civilians.
Resistance continued until 1913, but by 1902 most of the guerrillas had been pushed way from major cities.
Editorial cartoon “The White Man's Burden” shows John Bull and Uncle Sam delivering ungrateful colored peoples of the world to civilization.
The Spanish-American War also highlighted the military importance of building a canal in Panama.
The United States Pacific Fleet, after defeating the Spanish in the Philippines, had to sail around South America to engage Spain in the Caribbean.
The California Gold Rush had brought the Colombian province of Panama to the attention of investors.
Steamships from East Coast ports brought passengers to Panama, who, by 1855, could take a U.S.built and -owned railway to the Pacific side, embarking onto other steamers for the trip up to California.
In 1902 the United States government bought the French canal company’s land for $40 million.
Although the French project managed to do some of the most difficult digging, they had abandoned the project several years earlier.
Ferdinand De Lessups had planned a sealevel canal, like the Suez in Egypt, but the hilly topography made locks more practical, while the tropical jungles meant malaria for canal workers.
Panamanians | the “liberation” of Panama from Colombia. were upset at the delay, and it did not take much for the United States to help engineer the independence of Panama, sending a naval destroyer to discourage the Colombian government from sending troops.
Almost immediately, the new government of Panama signed the Canal Zone over to the United States The Canal, opened in 1914, was an impressive engineering feat, shortening the trip for cargo between the oceans.
The United States withdrew from the Canal Zone and the canal became Panamanian property on Dec., 1999.
In 1873 Minor C Keith began planting banana trees alongside his railroad in Costa Rica.
The government had defaulted on some payments to Keith, but instead gave him 800,000 acres of taxfree land along the rail line.
When the railroad failed to pay for itself in the 1890s, Keith concentrated on bananas.
He merged with Baker’s Boston Fruit Company, which was growing bananas on about 10,000 acres in Jamaica.
U.F.C. quickly bought up several competitors and gained control of 80% of the bananas reaching the United States In 1901, American author O Henry coined the term “banana republic” in his book Cabbages and Kings, inspired by a visit to Honduras in 1897.
His point was that companies like the U.F.C. didn’t limit themselves to bananas.
In 1900 the company began a travel service to Central America on its steamers and produced an illustrated travel guide called The Golden Caribbean.
In 1901 _ the government of Guatemala contracted with U.F.C. to run ana the nation’s postal service.
Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company, and by 19380 U.F.C. was worth over $200 million and was the largest employer in Central America.
The company owned over 3. million acres of land, making it the largest landowner in Guatemala.
Hundreds were killed, including dozens gathered in a town plaza in support of the strike.
This 1928 Banana Massacre was described by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude.
In 1983, Sam Zemurray (founder of the rival Cuyamel Fruit Company) acquired U.F.C. in a hostile takeover.
Zemurray had gotten into the business in 1895 by buying overripe bananas from U.F.C. and selling them cheaply in New Orleans.
In 1910 Zemurray bought 15,000 acres in Honduras and the following year he conspired with a former president of Honduras and an American mercenary general to depose the elected government and install a military regime friendlier to foreign business, especially his.
The general who led the coup became commander of the Honduran Army and was later appointed United States Consul to Honduras.
In 1934 members of the banana workers union in Costa Rica began a national strike that spread to thirty other unions.
The U.F.C. tried to divide workers and their salaries based on professional or ethnic differences, and even deported foreign workers.
The unions and the U.F.C. came to an agreement after about a month, but the U.F.C. did not follow through on its agreements.
Instead, the company began a public relations campaign depicting the unions as communist revolutionaries, with the backing of Costa Rica’s government.
Unrest and instability in the region threatened shipping lanes and the building and maintenance of the Panama Canal, so between 1908 and 1938, the United States government sent troops to quell disorders in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
By the with the poem “La United Fruit Co.”, Nobel end of the period, the Prize-winning Chilean poet Pablo Neruda Marines had trained national hunted Ee eee aay police forces, whose leaders then took over their own governments.
The Trujillo dictatorship lasted until 1960 in the Dominican Republic, while the Somoza family ruled Nicaragua until 1979.
On a lighter note, the Marines also introduced baseball into the countries they occupied; it is still the national sport of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Dominicans.
South Asia was part of the British Empire, East Asia and Oceania were divvied up, and the Americas were either already colonized or had established republics whose existence was accepted by Europeans and the United States The rivalries among the Europeans were based on the desire to create captive consumer markets for their manufactures and to secure resources like copper, tin, cotton, rubber, palm oil, tea, cocoa, and coffee upon which their industries depended.
Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913, showing how the Scramble for Africa affected the continent.
After the British began enforcing an end to the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, European contact with most of sub-Saharan Africa consisted of trade for ivory and other goods at a handful of trading posts.
The Portuguese in Africa defended their preexisting arrangements, while the British and French began to rush deeper into the continent.
The Europeans made agreements with many local kings and chieftains and went to war with others, always seeking a pledge of loyalty to their particular empire.
The Berlin Conference was attended by representatives from 18 European powers plus the The conference of Berlin, where Europeans United States.
No African divided up Africa in 1884-5. countries were represented except for the Ottoman provinces along the Mediterranean.
Administrative boundaries deliberately cut across existing political and ethnic boundaries, in some cases forcing warring groups to live and work together, in others dividing tribes and their allies.
This weakened resistance in the short run, but, as will be examined in a later chapter, became a source of civil unrest, separatist movements, and boundary disputes among the new African countries formed in the 1950s and 60s.
However, European treatment of African laborers often included whipping, torture, and other punishments, alongside debt peonage.

They were interesting in forming a community of farmers that could supply the fleets rounding the Cape of Good Hope on their way to the East Indies.
Thousands of Dutch and other Europeans were attracted by the relatively cooler climate of southern Africa and plentiful arable land; and like the British and the United States in North America, they were more interested in removing the natives rather than subjugating them.
The British took control of the territory from the Dutch during the Napoleonic period.
In the 1830s, the imperial government began abolishing slavery and requiring English in schools and in legal transactions.
At the same time, the descendants of unions between Europeans, Africans, and natives of the Dutch East Indies brought in as laborers (collectively known as “coloured”) occasionally established their own autonomous regions.
The British also faced the Zulus, who, led by their extraordinary leader Shaka Zulu and his well-trained army, had established an independent kingdom in eastern South Africa in the 1820s.
When local British commanders’ decided to attack a growing military threat from the Zulus in 1879, the imperial regiments were defeated by Zulu troops in a series of major battles.
A second invasion of Zululand was successful, but the British Sketch of King Shaka from . ; 1824, continued to recognize Zulu autonomy in much of their territory.
The descendants of the Dutch settlers called themselves “Boers” and successfully repelled a British invasion in 1881.
They were defeated in the Second Boer War , after a bloody conflict that included a wide guerrilla war and concentration camps for Boer civilians.
A young Winston Churchill, the future Prime Minister of Great Britain, went to South Africa as a journalist to report on the war, and instead was captured by the Boers.
Churchill escaped and his story of heroism helped launch his career in British politics.
This new Union was effectively an autonomous dominion within the British Empire, much like Canada.
Rhodes Scholars include Bill Clinton, Rachel Maddow, Bobby Jindal, and_ Kris Kristofferson.
Rhodes Scholarships do a lot for the memory of Cecil Rhodes, just as the Nobel Prize does a lot for the memory of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite whose company “The Rhodes Colossus” cartoon, published after Rhodes announced plans for a telegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo in factories during his lifetime. —_1892.
The son of a well-connected Anglican minister, Rhodes joined his brother in 1871 in South Africa at age 18, to recuperate from tuberculosis.
He dabbled in farming and then, financed by the Rothschild bank that had helped Britain buy the Suez Canal, began buying diamond mines.
Rhodes returned to England to attend Oxford, but left after a year to resume his diamond business, eventually founding the De Beers Company in 1888.
During his year at Oxford, Rhodes absorbed the philosophy of imperialism.
Rhodes took this idea back to Africa, and once declared “We are the finest race in the world and the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race” As noted, the British were not the only people who believed themselves to be superior to the people they conquered.
Europeans and the Americans also believed it was their job to help “civilize” the rest of the world.
The “White Man’s Burden” and the “Civilizing Mission” of imperialism were big themes -— we still call countries in what was once described as the “third world” as “ developing nations,” as if the goal of all the nations in the world is to become like Europe and the United States, who have a responsibility to help them do just that.

They sailed up the Yangzi River and threatened the Grand Canal and Beijing, forcing the Chinese to surrender and agree to the unequal treaty.
The Royal Navy used them against the Egyptians in 1882 during Egypt’s civil war.
The United States used them to support American troops during the Battle of San Juan Hill when Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders made their famous charge.
In one battle, the British used Maxim Guns to “fight off” 5,000 attacking Zulu warriors.
In 1898 the British were able to kill 20,000 Sudanese warriors with four Maxim Guns in a few hours without taking many casualties.
This was the beginning of a period of asymmetrical warfare based on technology that continues to the present — and forced people who could not stand up to the imperialists’ superior weapons to find other ways to resist.
In addition to weapons and transportation, Europeans and Americans had the added advantage of communications.
A successful undersea cable line between Britain and the United States was completed in 1866, and Britain and India were connected in 1870.
Australia was linked to the system in 1872 and a trans-Pacific cable was completed in 1903 linking the United States with Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines.
Although telegraphy had been pioneered by Americans like Samuel Morse, the British dominated undersea cable.
At the end of the 19th century, Britain owned 24 of the world’s 30 cable-laying ships and the British owned and operated 2/3 of the world’s cable.
During World War I, British telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while Britain was very successful cutting German cables, forcing the Germans to rely on wireless transmissions that were easy to listen and decipher.
Europeans treated their military success over colonized people as proof of their cultural superiority.
They developed theories of scientific racism and Social Darwinism to justify their choice to treat conquered peoples as less than fully human.
They also took advantage of previous African customs and_ tribal animosities to divide the conquered Africans, or created new ones based on their own prejudices.
In Rwanda, the Belgians noted the existence of separate castes that lived side-by-side for generations under the same rule.
However, the Belgians decided to put the cattle-raising Tutsis, ten percent of the population, over the Hutu farmers.
Because of more access to animal protein, the Tutsis seemed taller and better-looking to the Europeans and were deemed to be naturally superior to the Hutus.
After independence, the Hutus took control and subjected the Tutsis to periodic pogroms.
In 1994, nearly a million Tutsis were killed by their neighbors in a governmentorchestrated genocide, until a largely Tutsi-led guerrilla insurgency took over the government.
However, in the aftermath up to 2 million Hutu refugees fled Rwanda for the Congo, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and destabilizing central Africa even further.
Oil was first drilled by a Russian engineer on the Apsheron Peninsula on the west side of the Caspian Sea near Baku, Azerbaijan in 1848.
Edwin Drake’s famous well in Titusville, Pennsylvania, was drilled 11 years later in 1859.
Illustration Although Russian fields and from a 1909 book is captioned, “Where it refineries in Azerbaijan were Pale rereleun industry pioneers, the United States took an early lead and by 1880 the Bradford Field in Pennsylvania produced 77% of the world’s oil supply.
But by the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire had taken back the lead in production.
By the first decade of the 20th century, commercial oil production was underway in Sumatra, Persia, Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico, as well as Texas, California, and Ohio.
Oil initially played a fairly simple role in the Industrial Revolution as a machine lubricant.
However, by the late 19th century, internal combustion engines, which relied on firing cylinders using gasoline or heavy oil as fuel, were quickly becoming more efficient, replacing steam-power in transportation.
Diesel-fired ship and train engines, for instance, carried less fuel than needed for coal-fired steam engines, while the gasoline-powered automobile quickly became commonplace by the second decade of the twentieth century.
As oil became increasingly central to powering industry and transportation, oil companies became more powerful and were able to project their economic influence to shape the politics of the countries they operated in.
This became especially true in the Arabian Peninsula, which until the discovery of oil had been a sparsely-populated desert.
Today, about 80% of the world’s readily-accessible oil reserves are located in the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States are the three largest producers.
The Chinese Empire continued its decline, as Europeans continued their presence in assigned trading ports, divvying up Chinese territory into “spheres of influence” in which commerce and _ Christian missionary activity was controlled by a particular European power.
By _ the 1890s, however, China also faced the rapidly industrializing Japanese “China the cake of kings and...of emperors”, a French political cartoon from 1898 depicting the Great Powers cutting up Empire.
In less than thirty the Chinese cake. years, the Japanese reconstructed their government, initiated industrial activity, and built up their military through conscription and the latest weapons and ship technology.
However, the Japanese home islands lacked deposits of key industrial inputs, chiefly coal, iron ore, and oil.
To acquire guaranteed resources and markets, the Japanese government began to play the imperial game, following the rules established by the Europeans.
Like the British in India and China, Japanese commerce laid claim to their own “sphere of influence” in Chinese territory, and claimed sovereignty over tributary states.
The brief Sino-Japanese War in 1895 ended with the Qing Empire granting the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan to Japan, and ceding trading rights in Korea and Manchuria.
At the end of the 19th century, a final conflict with the West would pave the way for radical change and the end of the Qing Empire in China.
The Boxer Rebellion was an anticolonial, anti-Christian revolt led by martial artists who called themselves the Righteous Fists, or “Boxers” by Westerners.
An eight-nation alliance, which included European nations, the U.S., and Japan, sent 20,000 troops to fight the Boxers.
The foreign soldiers freed the legations besieged in the capital, but they also looted Beijing and the surrounding countryside and summarily executed anyone suspected of being a Boxer.
The abject state of the Qing dynasty and the increasing regional power of Japan set the scene for China to become a battlefield for territorial conflicts between Russia, Japan, and the United States.
The United States acquired the Philippine Islands from Spain after the 1898 war, and immediately began projecting its own political and commercial power into East Asia.
Coming late to the imperial game in China, the United States sought to limit the existing “spheres of influence” and prevent new ones from being imposed by either Russia or Japan.
In 1900, Russia occupied Manchuria and came into conflict with Japanese interests on the Korean peninsula, leading to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5.
After the Japanese navy sank the main battleships of Russia’s Pacific fleet in the Battle of Port Arthur and held off the Russian army, the world realized the power of an organized and industrialized Japan; forcing the Europeans and Americans to consider the Japanese Empire as an equal, while inspiring non-European colonized peoples that the Europeans were not always invincible in war.
From the Russian side, however, defeat by the Japanese on the battlefield and on the seas was not only humiliating, but highlighted the ineffectiveness of the Tsarist regime.
Petersburg in January 1905, a major protest against the inept government ended when the Palace guard fired upon the _ peaceful demonstration, killing hundreds.
In the meantime, the Tsar sent most of the Russian Baltic Fleet to retake Port Arthur from the Japanese.
Two thirds of the ships were sunk by the Japanese Combined Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905.
In October 1905, Tsar Nicolas II acquiesced to the formation of an elected parliament, the Duma, and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.
However, the Tsar also agreed to end the unpopular war with Imperial Japan.
Peace between the Russians | and Japanese was negotiated ' in Portsmouth, Maine, in the United States, highlighting the increasing importance of > United States interests in East Asia.

China’s Liaotung Peninsula and was recognized as the sole power in Korea, which became part of the Japanese Empire in 1910.
The Russo-Japanese War also once again highlighted the extent to which the Qing government in China was hardly considered a factor in international relations.
Even though the war concerned Chinese territory, Chinese armies were not seriously involved in the fighting; nor were Chinese negotiators present at the Treaty of Portsmouth.
By that time, the Qing empire was devolving into a series of warlord-controlled regions.
Palace intrigues in the royal “Forbidden City” in Beijing had led to effective power being wielded by the Empress Dowager Cixi for nearly five decades until her death in 1908.
Although she at times embraced gradual reform of her government and military and periodically protested European and Japanese incursions, she was realistic enough to understand her limits.

It was not long before modernizing forces soon overthrew the decadent imperial system.

Cecil Rhodes, “Confession of Faith”, 1877 It often strikes a man to inquire what is the chief good in life; to one the thought comes that it is a happy marriage, to another great wealth, and as each seizes on his idea, for that he more or less works for the rest of his existence.

However, the official peace covered a growing tension that was beginning to flare up into military conflict.
Unification of Germany in 1870, after the Prussian-led victory over the French, had created a new nation with imperial aspirations in the middle of Europe.
Bismarck’s new nation competed with neighboring countries in industry, agriculture, and overseas empire-building.
The existence of a strong, united Germany ended the careful balance of power created by the Congress of Vienna in its effort to reset the clock and redraw the map after the Napoleonic Wars in 1815.
France and Germany were enemies and sought alliances against each other.
By 1914, most governments in Europe were preparing for an eventual war between these groups of allied nations, although no one knew what incident would bring the continent to battle.
But, as early as 1888, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had predicted that “some damned foolish thing in the Balkans” could initiate a widespread European conflict.
Empire against the “Allied Rival military coalitions in 1914: Allied Powers’, which at the Powers in green, Central beginning of the war was Powers in brown. called the “Triple Entente” after the original allies, France, Great Britain, and Russia.
Russia left the war in 1918, Italy joined the allies in 1915, and Japan was an additional ally on the French side.
The underlying causes of World War One were nationalism, opposition to foreign rule, and simmering rivalries between the Great Powers that were exacerbated by treaties requiring allies to enter a war once it began.
Africa was divided among the European empires at the Berlin Conference in 1885, while “Spheres of Influence” were established in China in order to regulate trade.
Not only did the Deutsches Reich aspire to become an imperial power like Britain, France, and Russia, it had rapidly built up its military and industrial power.
By the first two decades of the twentieth century, Germany surpassed Britain to become the largest economy in Europe and second in the world.
German scientists won more Nobel Prizes than any other nation beside the United States.
In 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm II took the imperial throne when both his grandfather and father died in rapid succession.
Wilhelm I, the King of Prussia whom Bismarck had made an emperor, ruled until he was 90.
Due to the elaborate intermarriages of the European ruling families, Wilhelm II was also the eldest grandson of Queen Victoria of England.
Perhaps taking inspiration from the British Empire, Wilhelm II launched Germany on a “New Course” toward overseas imperialism.
The Kaiser ordered his military leaders to read Alfred Thayer Mahan’s book, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, which had also impressed Theodore Roosevelt in America.
The new emperor also dismissed Bismarck as Chancellor in 1890 and began looking for ways to make Germany a colonial empire, through a much more Portrait of Kaiser Wilhelm II, 1902.
The eighty-four-year old Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef had been reigning since 1848.
His nephew, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the Crown Prince and expected to soon become the next Emperor.
In the area of western Europe between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea called the Balkan Peninsula, the AustroHungarian, the Russian, and re the Ottoman empires each THE BOILING POINT. claimed control.
As described “The boiling point”, a cartoon published in in the previous chapter, the Punch in October 1912.
By the end of the nineteenth century, newlyindependent nations of Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro and Serbia separated the Muslim Ottomans from the Catholic Austro-Hungarians.
The Orthodox Russians dreamed of reestablishing Constantinople in Istanbul, and felt a kinship with their fellow Orthodox Slavs, the Serbs and Bulgarians.
The Balkan conflict Bismarck had predicted began in 1908 with the Austro-Hungarian takeover of Bosnia from the Ottoman Empire.
Many Serbs lived in Bosnia, so Serbian nationalists wanted it to be part of Serbia.
The Serbs and Bulgarians deepened their alliance with the Russians, who also wanted to check the expanding influence of the Austrians in the Balkans.
The independent nations of the Balkans fell into war in 1912-1918, first with the Ottomans, resulting in an independent Albania, and then with each other as ethnic and religious boundaries were contested.
The Balkan armies on both sides dug into trenches as new arms and technology limited the movement of troops.
In an effort to strengthen Bosnian ties to Austria, Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand and his wife made an official visit to the regional capital of Sarajevo on June 30, 1914.
A secretive Serbian nationalist group, that had _ been encouraged and supported by Serbian military _ officers, plotted the assassination of the royal couple as their motorcade made its way through the city.
After some initial bungling, one of the Newspaper illustration of Gavrilo Princip killing Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife in Sarajevo. conspirators, nineteen-yearold Gavrilo Princip, shot and killed the Archduke and his pregnant wife.
The Austro-Hungarian government made a series of demands for restitution from the Serbian government.
Germany was bound by its treaty obligations to support any action taken by its ally AustriaHungary.
All of Europe’s armies had been preparing for a continentwide conflict since the unification of Germany in 1870.
All war plans relied on the quick mobilization of troops, and the extensive European railway network built in the nineteenth century moved regiments more rapidly than in any previous war.
This rapid deployment meant that as soon as one side mobilized, the opposing side also had to mobilize in defense.
Less time was available for calm decision-making as every nation rushed to arms.
In July 1914, when Austria declared war and shelled the Serbian capital, Belgrade, Russia mobilized its military.
Italy, which had a defensive alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, sat out of the first months of war, until its government decided to side with France, Great Britain, and Russia in early 1915.
Expecting to face 7 oo enemies on Germany’s ] 2 eastern and western borders, German soldiers in a railway supply train the German generals had on the way to the front in 1914.
Early in the been planning for years to war, all sides expected the conflict to be a initially fight a defensive war short one. with Russia in the east and an offensive war with France in the west; holding off invading Russian armies while focusing on defeating the French first.
In the first months of the war, the Germans were successful in carrying out their strategy.
The German army on the eastern front was able to stop and even defeat the advancing Russians.
On the western front, the German government asked permission of neutral Belgium to pass through on their way to a surprise attack on France.
The Germans advanced rapidly into France, but were halted by combined French and British forces, miles from Paris.
Both sides dug in, creating a network of opposing trenches that ultimately extended from the North Sea to the Swiss border.
Armies on both sides would be frustrated in their attempts to break through on this “western front” for the next four years.
The wars of the nineteenth century had been mobile, with generals coordinating the movements of infantry foot-soldiers, horse cavalry, and artillery cannons on _ the battle landscape.
However, conflicts like the Crimean War and the United States Civil War had begun introducing better, more deadly weapons.
The Charge of the Light Brigade had proven that cavalry was ineffective against dug-in Hussar Regiment fighting from a trench, on artillery.
And in the last the western Front, 1916. decades of the nineteenth century, Europeans had perfected the use of machine guns, German soldiers of the 11th Reserve practicing on native populations in their colonies.
And they were ready to use these on each other, rather than just on the so-called “barbarians” their empires ruled over.
When their artillery had not “softened up” the opposing forces enough, attackers would be met with enough machine gun fire to slow down any effective advance.
During four long years of war, millions would either be severely wounded or killed in the “no-man’s-land” that separated the opposing armies.

Imagine being ordered “over the top” in a charge against the enemy trench.
Frustrated with the stalemate of trench warfare, the opposing sides on the western front tried new technologies and strategies in search of a_ decisive First Serbian armed airplane, 1915. victory.
Airplanes, first developed by the Wright Brothers in 1908, proved their value in reconnaissance and later in strafing trenches with machine guns and dropping small bombs.
And in the spring of 1915, the Germans first experimented using poison gas on the battlefield.
Within months, all sides would develop different varieties of poison gas, while racing to improve the designs of their gas masks.
Poison gases added another devastating weapon to trench warfare, while achieving no significant advantage.
Chlorine and mustard gas were two of the most common chemical weapons used by both sides in the war.
In the case of mustard gas poisoning, the effects took 24 hours to begin and it could take four to five weeks to die.
German development of poisonous chlorine gas and its first use were supervised by Fritz Haber, a scientist who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing nitrogen from the atmosphere.
After 67,000 troops were killed and wounded by the gas in its first use in April 1915, Haber’s wife, the scientist Clara Immerwahr, killed herself with his service revolver in protest.
Airplanes and poison gas, alongside machine guns and massive artillery, simply became more cogs in the war’s increasinglyeffective killing machines.
More people were killed, but without any change in the outcome of the war.
Enormous battles raged for months at a time at Verdun and the Somme in 1916, resulting in millions of casualties but hardly any territorial changes.
The conflict on the Eastern Front, where the Germans and Austro-Hungarians faced the Russians, was more mobile.
In 1916, as the months-long Battle of Verdun seemed to be going against the French, the Russian Army overwhelmed Austrian forces in the Brusilov Offensive, the largest and most deadly of the war.
Hundreds of thousands died on both sides as the Russian army advanced, forcing the Germans to divert their forces from the Western Front.
Even before the entry of the United States in 1918, the war had become truly global.
Japan was eager to be counted as a world power, and Japanese leaders seized upon the opportunity the war provided to improve their Japanese troops landing during the Battle status in Asia.
After taking of Tsingtao, where they captured the German position. control of German colonies in China and the Pacific in 1914, Japan sent the Chinese government a list of 21 Demands.
The Chinese believed that giving in to Japan’s demands would have basically resulted in China becoming a colony of the Japanese Empire.
The Chinese government agreed to some of the demands, but leaked the list to British diplomats, who intervened to prevent a complete shift in the balance of power in Asia.
The German commander in East Africa, led a largely native African force in guerrilla tactics against Allied troops for most of the war.
In eastern Africa, disrupted crop cultivation and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths by starvation and disease.
The Ottoman Empire controlled territory on either side of Bosporus _ straits, which connect the Black Sea with the Mediterranean.
However, the Turks held the high ground above the landing site chosen for the mostly colonial troops.
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps troops were decimated, in a battle that marks the beginning of a sense of nationality in those countries.
The anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, April 25th, is still celebrated as ANZAC Day.
The disastrous plan nearly ended the political career of the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.
Scenes like this were common all over the Armenian provinces in the spring and summer months of 1915.
Death in its several forms—massacre, starvation, exhaustion—destroyed the larger part of the refugees.
The eleven month-long Gallipoli invasion was even more important for the Turks.
The hard-fought victory was led by General Mustafa Kemal, who soon became a national hero and would go on to found the modern Turkish Republic and serve as its first president after the war.
However, at nearly the same time as the Gallipoli landings, the Ottoman government also decided to take action against the Christian minority in Armenia.
The Armenians were loyal subjects (many were serving in the army when the persecution began), but after an unsuccessful Russian attempt to invade Turkey from the east, some military leaders in the Turkish government accused the Armenians of collaborating with the Russian troops and decided to eliminate the Armenian population.
Men were executed, while women and children were force-marched across the desert to Mesopotamia.
Nearly one million died in what was the worst genocide of the 20th century before the Holocaust of World War Two.
The imperial powers drafted soldiers from their colonies into the fight.
Many of the 18 million people killed in battle and 23 million wounded, were people ruled by the empires.
The French brought in African troops from Senegal and Morocco, who fought and died in the Indian bicycle troops at a crossroads at the trenches of Western Front Battle of the Somme, France. alongside other Allied soldiers.
British imperial subjects like the Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders fought beside their English cousins.
Over 700,000 Indians fought for Britain against the Ottomans in Mesopotamia.
Indian divisions were also sent to Gallipoli, Egypt, German East Africa, and Europe.
Despite all of the efforts for a breakthrough on the battlefields of France and Eastern Europe, the most effective strategy against Germany was the British-led naval blockade, which cut off grain and other food supplies from overseas.
The Germans, who had developed the most effective submarines and torpedoes, tried to blockade Great Britain and France by sinking incoming supply ships.
This German naval strategy, however, risked bringing the United States into the war.
The German government quickly backed away from unrestricted submarine warfare against supply ships bound for the Great Britain and France.
The United States had a long tradition of trying to avoid being drawn into the “Great Powers” conflicts of Europe.
American attitudes toward international affairs reflected the advice given by President George Washington Jane Addams and other American activists jn his 1796 Farewell Address, attending a peace conference in the to avoid “entangling alliances” Netherlands, 1915. with the Europeans.
The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 had gone further to establish the Western Hemisphere as the United States’ area of interest, implying that the United States did not intend to intrude in the affairs of Europe.
However, although the United States did not participate in international diplomatic alliances, American businesses and consumers benefited from the trade generated by nearly a century of European peace and the expansion of the transatlantic economy.
Additionally, by the 1880s and 1890s, millions of Europeans emigrated to the United States to work in factories and mines, or to establish farms in the West.
More Irish and Germans arrived, and also Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, and Jews from Eastern Europe.
The diversity among the immigrants in this American “melting pot” helped bolster the case for USS. neutrality in European affairs even as the war began.
A foreign policy’ of neutrality also reflected America’s focus on_ the building of its new powerful industrial economy, financed largely with loans and investments from Europe and especially London.
However, United States dependency on foreign capital began to change during the war, when American bankers began making substantial loans to Britain and France.
Rice to have the Morgan bank designated as the sole-source United States purchasing agent for both Britain and France.
Morgan and Company managed the Allies’ purchases of munitions, food, steel, chemicals, and cotton; receiving a 1% commission on all sales.
Woodrow Wilson’s Secretary of State, the populistleaning William Jennings Bryan, objected to the loans and argued that by denying financing to any of the belligerents, the United States could hasten the end of the war.
Morgan and Company’s Managing Director, Thomas Lamont, presented his views in a 1915 speech to the American Academy of Political and Social Science.
Lamont observed that the war offered the United States a unique opportunity to shift from being a debtor nation, dependent on loans from Europe and Britain, to becoming a global creditor.
America was poised, Lamont concluded, to become the trade and finance center of the world, and the United States dollar to replace the British pound sterling as the world’s currency.
But this would only happen, he warned, “if the war goes on long enough” A quick end to hostilities would allow Germany to rapidly regain its competitive position.
The best result for America would be a long war that ended in German defeat and left the winners deeply in debt to the United States.
United States agriculture also benefitted from the war raging in Europe.
Armies needed calories, but the sons of farmers (and their horses) in the wheat fields of France and elsewhere were being drafted into the conflict.
Soon grain from the Great Plains of the United States was feeding British and French troops on the Western Front, bringing wealth to Midwestern agricultural communities.
Farmers were soon purchasing new equipment and buying or renting additional land to produce more.
Despite Wall Street bankers’ interest in profiting on the European conflict, the United States federal government faced strong public opinion against entering what Americans saw as a fight they had no stake in.
Scandinavians and German immigrants declared both their neutrality and their general impression that Germany’s culture was superior to that of its European rivals.
Business leaders and social activists like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Jane Addams were pacifists.
But only a month after his second inauguration, Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany in April 1917.
The European powers had been building up _ their military capabilities for nearly a generation before the outbreak of war, and it was unclear whether the United States could mobilize Pancho Villa and members of the Division rapidly.
In late 1916, border of the North. . ‘ troubles in Mexico served as an important field test for modern American military forces and the National Guard.
Revolution and chaos threatened American business interests when Mexican reformer Francisco Madero challenged Porfirio Diaz’s corrupt and unpopular conservative regime.
Madero was jailed, fled to San Antonio, and planned the Mexican Revolution.
Although Diaz was quickly overthrown and Madero became president, the Revolution unleashed forces that demanded more social change, especially in land reform, that the new liberal government was capable of delivering.
New uprisings, led by Pancho Villa and Emilio Zapata, broke out in rural Mexico.
Reactionaries assassinated President Madero in Mexico City in early 1918, with the encouragement of the European and United States ambassadors, and a military regime was installed—but social upheaval and a guerrilla war continued.
The Wilson administration had officially withdrawn its support of the new military government and watched warily as_ the revolution devolved into assassinations and chaos.
In 1916, provoked by American support for his rivals, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Pancho Villa and John Pershing posed for a Mexico.
His troops killed photo together in August, 1914, six months seventeen Americans and before Pershing would chase Villa through northern Mexico. burned down the town center.
President Wilson commissioned General John “Black Jack” Pershing to capture Villa and disperse his rebels and used the powers of the new National Defense Act to mobilize over one hundred thousand National Guard soldiers from across the country as an invasion force in northern Mexico.
Although these troops failed to capture Villa, they gained experience in the field and developed into a more professional fighting force, which would form the basis of the United States army when war was declared against the Central Powers a few months later.
By the spring of 1917, President Wilson believed a German victory would drastically and dangerously alter the balance of power in Europe.
Submarine warfare had been a problem earlier in the conflict, when the Lusitania was sunk in 1915.
In 1917, the German general staff decided that a new push for victory on the Western Front needed to be combined with renewal of U-boat attacks in an effort to starve the British and French.
When decoded it was found to contain a suggestion from an official of the German foreign office to the German ambassador in Mexico that if the U S. entered the war, Mexico should be encouraged to invade America to regain the territory taken in the Mexican-American War.
However, Zimmerman soon acknowledged its authenticity, claiming he had only been suggesting a Mexican invasion if the United States had already entered the war.
The Mexican government, for its part, announced they had never seriously considered the German suggestion—after all, they were occupied with their own revolution.
With American public opinion finally behind him, President Wilson went to Congress in February, 1917 to announce that diplomatic relations with Germany had been severed.
The third year of the war saw a major change in German military prospects when the Romanov Dynasty of Tsar Nicholas II collapsed in March 1917.
The trouble had begun in late February with a strike by women factory workers in St.
Within a few days the army had sided with the revolutionaries and Nicholas II was forced to abdicate.
Liberal reformers soon established a republic, which actually made it easier for United States President Wilson to proclaim that the war was to “make the world safe for democracy,’ since a major ally was no longer ruled by an absolute monarch.
The revolutionaries and the soldier and sailors who supported them wanted to end Russian participation in the war.

The treaty also called for territories claimed by the Ottoman Empire to be handed over to Germany’s ally, but Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia declared their independence instead.
Russia also agreed to pay 6 billion marks to compensate Germany for its losses.
The Russian revolution soon became a civil war between the “Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army”, formed by the Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky, and the armies of the “White Russians” under several leaders, dedicated to restoring the Tsarist monarchy.
To prevent the return of the Romanovs to power, the revolutionaries had the entire family killed in July, 1918.
The revolutionaries also waged war on uncooperative peasants called Kulaks, whom they accused of withholding grain from the Bolshevik government.
Many of the Kulaks were Ukrainian, which contributed to an ongoing aggression toward the Ukraine by the new Soviet Union.
As soon as the war began, governments on both sides moved quickly to portray the war effort as a success and to eliminate any sign of dissent.
Britain censored mail sent by soldiers at the front to their families, instituting standardized postcards that allowed men in the trenches to choose from a menu of statements but not to write anything specific about their experiences.
Society became completely focused on the war effort, and governments reorganized the economy around war production.
The state also rationed food and strictly controlled the media to silence dissent and present news of the war that boosted the morale and resolve of the population.
The “Orwellian” censorship and propaganda in works like 1984 probably reflect his experience during the first World War.
Socialist Presidential candidate Eugene V Debs speaking against the draft in Canton, Ohio in 1918.
To stifle dissent in the United States , the government passed the Espionage Act in June, 1917.
Wilson also suggested that labor unions’ actions to defend worker rights during wartime would be considered an attack on America.
As the Russian Revolution was taken over by the Bolsheviks, United States concern shifted from draft resistance to socialism and a “Red Scare” gripped America.
Hundreds were arrested, deported, and jailed under the Espionage and Sedition Acts.
Women on all sides served as nurses and medics, and worked in agriculture and industry to keep the economy going while men were away fighting.
Many governments promised equal pay, although most did not make good on their promise.
But women gained political influence, and achieved the right to vote in the United States and many European countries almost immediately after the war’s end as a result of their contributions to the war effort.
Until the spring of 1917, the Allies possessed few effective defensive measures against German submarine attacks, which had sunk more than a thousand ships by the time the United States entered the war.
The rapid addition of American naval escorts to the British surface fleet and the establishment of a convoy system countered much of the effect of German submarines.
Shipping and military losses declined rapidly, just as the American army arrived in Europe in large numbers.
Although many of the supplies still needed to make the transatlantic passage, the physical presence of the army proved to be a fatal blow to German plans to dominate the Western Front.
By the middle of July 1918, each and every the Kaiser inspecting a communications one had failed to break trenchon the western front, 1918. through the Western Front.
Then, on August 8, 1918, two million men of the American Expeditionary Forces joined the British and French armies in a series of successful counteroffensives that pushed the disintegrating German lines back across France.
The gamble of the Spring Offensive had exhausted Germany’s military, making defeat inevitable.
Kaiser Wilhelm IJ abdicated at the request of the German military leaders and a new democratic government agreed to an armistice on November 11, 1918, hoping that by embracing Wilson’s call for democracy, Germany would be treated more fairly in the peace talks.
Even if a nation was relatively self-sufficient in food production under normal circumstances, war was not a normal circumstance.
The British blockade of Germany prevented not only war supplies but food from reaching the German people, resulting in a half million civilian deaths.
For the Europeans, World War One was a “Total War” involving every level of society.
By the end of the war, more than 4. million American men had served in all branches of the military.
The United States lost over one hundred thousand men, fifty-three thousand dying in battle and even more from disease.
Their terrible sacrifice, however, paled before the European death toll.
After four years of stalemate and brutal trench warfare, France had suffered almost a million and a half military dead and Germany even more.
Even as war raged on the Western Front, an even deadlier threat loomed.
In the spring of 1918, a new strain of the influenza virus appeared in the farm country of Kansas and hit nearby Camp Funston, one of the largest army training camps in the nation.
Between March and May 1918, fourteen of the largest American military training camps reported outbreaks of influenza.
Some of the infected soldiers carried the virus on troop transports to France.
By September 1918, influenza had spread to all training camps in the United States.
Unlike most flu viruses, the H1NI1 strain struck down those in the prime of their lives rather than old people and young children.
A disproportionate number of influenza victims were between ages eighteen and thirty-five.
In Europe, influenza hit troops and civilians on both sides of the Western Front.
The disease was misnamed “Spanish Influenza,” due to accounts of the disease that first appeared in the uncensored newspapers of neutral Spain while the warring nations tried to suppress the news of disease for propaganda purposes.
Reports from the surgeon general of the army revealed that while 227,000 American soldiers had been hospitalized from wounds received in battle, almost half a million suffered from influenza.
The worst part of the wartime epidemic struck during the height of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the fall of 1918 and weakened the combat capabilities of both the American and German armies.
Four waves of worldwide infection spread before cases and deaths finally began fading in the early 1920s.
Question for Discussion Compare the “Spanish Flu” with the current COVID-19 pandemic.
On December 4, 1918, President Wilson became the first American president to travel overseas while in office.
Wilson went to Europe to end “the war to end wars”, and he intended to shape the peace.
The German, Russian, AustrianHungarian, and Ottoman Empires each evaporated and the map of Europe was redrawn to accommodate new independent nations.
As Woodrow Wilson traveling from Versailles part of the armistice, Allied fice enue oe ery forces occupied territories in the Rhineland separating Germany and France, to prevent conflicts there from reigniting war.
Anew German government disarmed while Wilson and other Allied leaders gathered in France at Versailles to dictate the terms of a settlement to the war.
After months of deliberation, the Treaty of Versailles officially ended the war.
The plan not only addressed territorial issues but offered principles on which Wilson believed a long-term peace could be built.
The president called for reductions in armaments, freedom of the seas, adjustment of colonial claims, and the abolition of the types of secret treaties that had led to the war.
Some members of the international community welcomed Wilson’s idealism, but in January 1918, Germany still anticipated a favorable verdict on the battlefield and did not seriously consider accepting the terms of the Fourteen Points.
At the center of the plan was a new international organization, the League of Nations.
This promise of collective security, that an attack on one sovereign member would be viewed as an attack on all, was a key component of the Fourteen Points.
Wilson’s Fourteen Points speech was translated into many languages, and was even sent to Germany to encourage negotiation.
But while President Wilson was celebrated in Europe as a “God of Peace,” many of his fellow statesmen were less enthusiastic about his plans for postwar Europe.
And America’s closest allies had little interest in the League of Nations.
Allied leaders focused instead on guaranteeing the future safety of their own nations.
Unlike the United States, safe across the Atlantic, the Allies had endured the horrors of the war firsthand.
Negotiations made it clear that British prime minister David Lloyd-George was more interested in preserving Britain’s imperial domain, while French prime minister Clemenceau wanted severe financial reparations and limits on Germany’s future ability to wage war.
The fight for a League of Nations was therefore largely on the shoulders of President Wilson.
Morgan nation and led to World War and Company and peace negotiator at Versailles.
Wilson’s Fourteen Points have received more attention from historians, but Britain and France were successful getting the punitive items they wanted into the final treaty.
By June 1920, the final version of the treaty was signed and President Wilson was able to return home.
The treaty was a compromise that included demands for German reparations, provisions for the League of Nations, and the promise of collective security.
According to historian Ferdinand Lundberg, the “total wartime expenditure of the United States government from April 6, 1917, to October 31, 1919, when the last contingent of troops returned from Europe, was $35,418,000,000.
Morgan and Company would earn additional millions loaning Germany the money the treaty required it to pay to the allies so they could pay the bankers.
President Wilson’s call for self-determination in the Fourteen Points appealed to many under Ottoman rule, especially the Arabs.
In the aftermath of the war, Wilson sent a commission to determine the conditions and aspirations of the people.
The King-Crane Commission found that most favored an independent state free of European control.
However, the people’s wishes were largely ignored and the lands of the former Ottoman Empire were divided into several nations created by Great Britain and France with little regard to ethnic realities.
The British in particular wanted to continue to control the Suez Canal which was their route to India, and to monopolize the oil of the Persian Gulf to fuel the diesel engines of their navy and merchant marine.
The Arab provinces of the Ottomans were to be ruled by Britain and France as “mandates” and a new nation of Turkey emerged in the former Ottoman heartland in Anatolia.
Though supposedly established for the benefit of the Middle Eastern people, the mandate system was essentially a reimagined form of nineteenth-century imperialism.
His sons Abdullah and Faisal were chosen to be kings of Transjordan and of Syria, where Faisal was rejected and so instead became the king of | Iraq.
The Iraqi dynasty ended in violence with the murder of Faisal’s grandson in 1958, but Abdullah’s dynasty still an rules Jordan, under Abdullah ee and Iraqi King Faisal in II and Queen Rania.
In Hejaz, Hussein Ibn Ali was overthrown in 1925 by Ibn Saud, a tribal leader from eastern Arabia.
Through strategic marriages with other tribes, Ibn Saud established Saudi Arabia.
He had so many children that the current king is still one of his many sons.
The disposition of the Middle East was complicated by the increasing importance of its oil resources.
Oil had been discovered in Iran in 1908, and during the period when petroleum was becoming the most important commodity of the twentieth century it was also becoming clear that some of the world’s largest reserves were located in the Middle East.
The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was established in 1908 to control production in Iran.
After the war, Britishcontrolled businesses that had been licensed by the Ottomans to develop oil discovered in Mesopotamia spurred British interest in creating the new Kingdom of Iraq under British mandate in 1920.
The British-controlled multinational, TPC (Turkish Petroleum Company, established in 1912), received a 75-year concession to develop Iraq’s oil.
The movement to establish a Jewish Homeland—Zionism—was begun in the 1890s by Jewish Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl.
Shocked by how Jews were being persecuted throughout Europe, even in liberal France, Herzl concluded that Jews would never be fully accepted as citizens anywhere and _ that they needed to establish a separate Jewish homeland.
Originally, most Jews around the world, especially more religious Jews, rejected the movement because they believed that Jews were not to return to Israel until the Messiah came.
Zionists in Palestine often had problems with their Arab neighbors, who looked upon these new arrivals as Europeans trying to take over their country.
In the heat of the war, in 1917, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour promised that Palestine would be recognized as a “Jewish homeland,” in an attempt to gain support of Jews among the belligerents—not realizing that Zionism was hardly the majority view at that time within Judaism.
Of course, the British also promised to respect Arab sovereignty in Palestine; setting the stage for conflict in the region that has continued to today.
The charred corpse of Will Brown, victim of Omaha, Nebraska lynching, September 1919.
Industrial war production and massive wartime service had created vast labor shortages, and thousands of black southerners had traveled to the North and Midwest to work in factories.
But the Great Migration of Black people escaping the traps of southern poverty and Jim Crow sparked new racial conflict when white northerners and returning veterans fought to reclaim the jobs and the neighborhoods they believed were theirs alone.
The overseas experience of Black Americans and their return triggered a dramatic change in their home communities.
Du Bois, a black scholar and author who had encouraged blacks to enlist, highlighted African American soldiers’ combat experience when he wrote of returning troops, “We return.
But white Americans just wanted a return to the status quo, a world that did not include social, political, or economic equality for black people.
And they were alarmed and frightened by the thought of fearless, capable black men who had learned to handle weapons and defend themselves on foreign battlefields.
In 1919, racist riots erupted across the country from April until October.
The bloodshed included thousands of injuries, hundreds of deaths, and vast destruction of private and public property across the nation.
The weeklong Chicago Riot, from July 27 to August 8, 1919, considered the summer’s worst, included mob violence, murder, and arson.
Race riots had rocked the nation before, but the Red Summer was something new.
This behavior galvanized many in_ black communities, but it also shocked white Americans who interpreted black self-defense as a prelude to total revolution.
In the fall, an organization called the African Blood Brotherhood formed in northern cities as a permanent “armed resistance” movement.
But the Russian-led Communist International had no interest in semi-independent groups like the ABB with their Afro-Marxist ideas.
The wave of widespread lynching and riots against AfricanAmericans lasted into the early 1920s.
One of the most prosperous Black communities in the United States, the Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was burned to the ground and over a hundred people were killed by a white supremacist attack that included aerial bombing in June 1921.
Many white Americans felt threatened by African-American success and increased social mobility.
The early 1920s also saw a resurgence of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, which now added immigrant Jews and Catholics to the list of those who would destroy “traditional” white Protestant America.
These ideas culminated in the Immigration Act of 1924, which lowered overall immigration to a small fraction of what it was before World War One, while setting up a quota system based on the ethnic makeup in the United States in 1890, a time before many Jewish and Catholic immigrants arrived from southern and eastern Europe.
The desire to rid the United States of what the majority perceived as evil is also seen in the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibited the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States Liquor had ruined many American families, and women in particular had suffered as abused spouses.
The Women’s Christian Temperance Union and similar prohibitionist organizations were prominent in the Progressive movement, pushing for a federal graduated income tax to replace the lucrative tax on liquor.
The war made prohibition even more patriotic, since the beer industry was dominated by immigrant Germans, and the amendment was ratified shortly after the end of the war.
TRAFALCAR SQUARE, a Nr Communist victory in the NEXT OP™ Russian Civil War enflamed SOME YOUR THOUSAKDS American fears of communism.
Arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and murder, their trial focused not on the defendants’ guilt or innocence, but on their anarchist political affiliations.
Sacco and Vanzetti were quickly convicted and sentenced to death, setting off a series of appeals and motions for mistrial.
In 1925, while the two men sat on death row, another man confessed to the crime and provided details that made his confession credible.
People all over the world demonstrated their sympathy with the accused.
Demonstrations were held in London, Paris, Geneva, Amsterdam, and Tokyo.
Famous authors wrote about the case, such as John Dos Passos’s Facing the Chair, Maxwell Anderson’sGods of the Lightning or Upton Sinclair’s Boston.
The Industrial Workers of the World labor union called a three-day national walkout to protest the executions.
Sacco and Vanzetti were executed just after midnight on August 238, 1927.
The Sacco-Vanzetti case demonstrated an American paranoia about immigrants and the potential spread of radical ideas, especially those related to international communism.
Intellectuals had shared in the celebration when war had been declared, parading in the streets of many national capitals.
It is unclear exactly what they were expecting from the war, but their experience was quite different.
No one exposed to the misery of trench warfare could hang onto illusions of the heroism and nobility of the struggle they were engaged in.
The cold, the Ernest Hemingway in uniform in Milan, mud, and the terror of 1918.
The absurdity of Western culture was on display in what has come to be known as the modern crisis.
The trenches had also been an unusual opportunity for the classes to mix.
Some upper-class British officers such as Ford developed a new understanding of people they probably would never have met in their normal lives at home.
Other novels dealing with these themes include German author Thomas Mann’s Magic Mountain , Rebecca West's The Return of the Soldier (published in England as the war was ending in 1918), and even Virginia Woolf’s most famous book, Mrs.
The atoms that were assumed to be the basic building blocks were imagined to function like little billiard balls, obeying all the laws of motion that scientists had studied in the “macro” world of regular experience.
By the late 19th century scientists had discovered nearly 70 elements out of the 90 or so that occur naturally on earth.
Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleyev had explored the chemical nature of the elements and developed the periodic table that expresses their chemical relationships.
On the other end of the spectrum, at the astronomical scale, the universe was believed to be made up of an eternal field of stars that spread in all directions.
This idea was challenged by Edwin Hubble’s_ discovery around 1925 that the Andromeda nebula, a fuzzy patch on the star maps, and other “spiral nebulae” were actually distant galaxies and that all the visible stars were just nearby members of our Photograph of the “Great Andromeda own, Milky Way galaxy.
Reet Hubble discovered more galaxies, and then used measurements of their Doppler shifts in light wavelengths to deduce that the universe was not steady and eternal, but expanding.
Albert Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity suggested there were no static cosmological solutions, which led to the formulation of the Big Bang Theory by Belgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaitre.
Atoms had been thought of as tiny billiard balls, obeying the basic laws of motion suggested by classical physics.
Einstein challenged these ideas with his work on electromagnetics, and then Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Louis De Broglie, and Erwin Schrédinger smashed the classical model entirely with their development of quantum mechanics.
Others picked up on this idea, which became a metaphor for the intrusion of explorers and experimenters into the things they were exploring.
Scientists at the 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels included Marie Curie, Erwin Schrédinger, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Max Plank, and Albert Einstein.
Even sociologists and anthropologists were influenced by the uncertainty principle, and began wondering how their arrival in people’s lives to gather data about their cultures actually altered those cultures.
Psychologists Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung complicated matters even more when they suggested that there was a whole lot going on in the human subconscious over which we do not have control or even direct knowledge.
The solid, rational basis of the western world was beginning to look like a house of cards or a shared hallucination that might evaporate at any moment.
Already in the 19th century, the challenge and promise of industrialization, liberalism and nationalism had changed the themes _ traditionally considered by artists, while the attempt to get at the essence of a scene inspired painters to record their first egyard Munch's “The Scream” “impression” of a_ scene, highlighting color and light over form.
Even before World War One, the experimentation of the mainly French impressionists and post-impressionists (like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent Van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin) inspired artists like the Norwegian Edvard Munch towards expressionism—using the impressionist style to express interior emotions.
Munch’s “The Scream” from 1898 perhaps best sums up the “shock of the new” experienced not just by the artists but by much of society in the new industrializing world.
Abstract expressionism after the war reverted to forms and shapes to reveal interior thoughts and feelings, such as in Wassily Kandinsky’s “Yellow-RedBlue” and Paul Klee’s “Ancient Sound”, both painted in 1925.
Yellow-Red-Blue, Wassily Kandinsky, 1925 The surrealist and Dadaist movements of the 1920s especially pointed to the absurdity of societal conventions, exploded in the carnage of World War One.

After the war, German expressionists produced the horror film The Cabinet of Dr.

Hyperinflation Peace began in Europe with the hope that the new nationstates that replaced the German, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian Empires in Central Europe would deliver social justice and prosperity through new democratic constitutions.
Not everybody was willing to wait patiently for life to get better after the war and pandemic, however.
And the new Soviet Union, which had survived attempts by the allies and the United States to defeat the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, felt justified in trying to export their “workers revolution” to the rest of Europe.
Attempts at violent communist-inspired revolution led to violent reactions.
Many believed the bloodbath in the trenches had to have meant something more than just gaining the right to vote—perhaps it was to birth a new socialist utopia, replacing the not just the monarchs who started the war, but the capitalists who profited from it.
However, just weeks later, Bolshevik-inspired revolutionary actions like the Spartacist Revolt in Berlin were brutally suppressed by the new German government with the help of the paramilitary Fretkorps—troops returning from the front who, having just fought for their nation, did not want Germany taken over by a “foreign” socialist revolution.
Although the new government was not treated as an equal by the Allies at Versailles, delegates elected from all over Germany met at Weimar, the cultural capital of Germany, at the same time to write the most representative constitution in the world, which was adopted in August 1919.
The Weimar Republic included an elected president and parliament, the Reichstag, as well as a chancellor who organized a cabinet of government ministers.
Elections were based on proportional representation, which almost always results in a multi-party government.
The spectrum of political parties included pro-Republic social democrats, liberals, and Christian democrats in the middle, with anti-democratic nationalists, monarchists and fascists on the right, and revolutionary socialists and communists on the left.
This wide range of political orientations was typical in most European democracies between the world wars.
All the countries of Europe, both old and new, faced massive unemployment and inflation after the war as their economies readjusted and veterans returned to the workforce.
However, these problems were magnified in Germany because on top of everything else, under the Versailles Treaty, the new government had to pay reparations to the Allies in the form of gold, coal and timber.
By 1923, the Germans were unable Spartacist rebels holding a street in Berlin, 1919.
The German government encouraged a widespread strike to protest the occupation, which it funded funded by printing more paper money.
Like nearly all of the world’s currencies, the German Deutschmark had originally been backed by gold, but the Kaiser had taken the country off the gold standard at the beginning of the war.
Germany had expected to capture territory that would pay for its war expenses, but defeat and reparations changed the situation drastically.
Printing more Deutschmarks decreased the value of each one, until ultimately they were not worth the paper they were printed on.
Piles of new Notgeld banknotes awaiting distribution at the Reichsbank during the hyperinflation.
The 1923 Weimar German inflation became a textbook case of hyperinflation.
And of course, gold was not the only commodity that was becoming unaffordable in terms of marks.
Stories circulated of people taking wheelbarrows full of Deutschmarks to the marked to buy a loaf of bread.
As typically happens with hyperinflation, when workers received their pay they would rush to markets and immediately buy everything they could before the currency was worth any less.
Workers demanded higher wages to keep up with higher prices, which only added more worthless currency to the money supply and created more inflation.
The savings of middle-class families, set aside for a house, a car, or for retirement, were wiped out to purchase food for a week.
Adding to the financial chaos, previous debts were quickly paid off with the nowworthless marks.
United States bankers, led by Charles G Dawes, sat down with financial representatives of the other Allied powers to renegotiate German reparations.
Dawes had helped secure the $500 million Anglo-French Loan and had then served as a General during the _ war.
American financiers understood that a chaotically unstable German economy would never be able to pay indemnities to the British, French, and others, which charles G, Dawes made it more difficult for these Allies to cover their own debts to Wall Street.
The solution Dawes negotiated was to have United States banks lend Germany the money it needed to keep up payments to the European Allies, who could then pay the Americans, who in turn could lend more to Germany.
The cycle of payments continued until the American banks were forced to stop lending at the beginning of the Great Depression, which we will discuss shortly.
The Soviet Union After its victory over the counterrevolutionary White Army, the Communists began establishing their version of the workers’ state envisioned by Marx in the new Soviet Union.
A successful socialist revolution in Russia inspired dedicated Marxists around the world, prompting general strikes and attempted workers’ uprisings in Europe and even in the United States.
However, Lenin’s tactics divided the revolutionaries from the reformers in the international socialist movement.
Russia had barely begun moving toward democracy and had very few industries when Lenin and _ Bolsheviks overthrew the government.
Many believed Russia was an exception, and even Lenin struggled to fit events in the new Soviet Union into the outline of future history that Marx had provided.
The Bolsheviks were able to take over the Russian government in 1917 because they were more organized and aggressive than any of their political rivals.
Lenin and the communists declared themselves the true representatives of Marx’s ideas and argued that their model should be followed by communist parties in other countries.
Others who also called themselves socialists disagreed with Lenin’s interpretation of Marx , and many were more interested in reform than in revolution.
Debates over both doctrine and actions split the international movement into revolutionary communists and _ reform socialists, with Lenin setting up his own “Communist International” to oppose the older Socialist International of social democratic political parties.
Until the mid-1930s, Soviet communists often spent more energy struggling against social democrats and other parties on the left in an attempt to be the only force representing the working class, rather than fighting right-wing reactionaries and fascists.
Meanwhile, debates over policy and leadership in the Soviet Union itself had both domestic and international consequences.
Marx had focused his analysis on an industrial society where workers would own the means of production rather than the bourgeoisie—so Lenin and other Soviet leaders took over Russia’s factories and embarked on further industrializing their country.
The Red Army broke up the large landholdings of the old Russian nobility, distributing the land to those who worked it.
Already during the war and the civil war, distrust had grown against the Kulaks, small farmers living mainly in the Ukraine.
Lenin had denounced them as “wreckers” when it seemed they were withholding their grain from government collectors.
These debates were still continuing when Lenin suffered a stroke and died in 1923.
One of the main dangers of a cadre party is deciding on changes of leadership.
Trotsky argued in favor of a “permanent revolution,” stalin confers with an ailing Lenin in constantly perfecting the September 1922. workers’ state, which including eliminating private property in the countryside and collectivizing the agricultural sector.
Trotsky went into exile, where he and his followers founded yet another Trotskyist International of likeminded revolutionaries.
Stalin, in the meantime, announced the first in a series of Five-Year plans to industrialize the Soviet Union even more rapidly.
In his second plan, he embraced the forced collectivization of agriculture.
Stalin essentially came around to Trotsky’s view that small land-holders would become bourgeois anti-revolutionaries.
Stalin was becoming increasingly paranoid of any social sector or group of leaders that he thought threatened his own authority, including his hold over the Communist cadre, the Comintern, and the apparatus of the Soviet bureaucracy.
The forced collectivization of agriculture in the early 1930s led to death by starvation of nearly three million Ukrainians.
Peasants resisted the loss of their land by planting and harvesting fewer crops and by killing their livestock before they could be seized.
Many peasants were punished by the authorities, who confiscated everything they had and left them to starve.
By 1931 when Stalin announced to the world that the wildly successful five-year plan had been completed ahead of schedule, at least 3 million peasants had died.
As the claims made by Stalin diverged more and more from reality, dissenters had to be dealt with.
Stalin began sending critics to Gulag concentration camps in Siberia, or simply having them executed by his secret police.
In the late 1930s, about 1. million suspected dissenters were arrested and 724,000 people were shot in the back of the head by Russian secret police.
Among these were hundreds from the Red Army officer corps, who Stalin suspected were sympathetic to the ideas of Trotsky.
Stalin had published a book about Lenin that outlined a “Correct” view of Marxist-Leninist ideology leading to himself and excluding Trotsky.
When Leningrad party leader Sergei Kirov was murdered in 1984, Stalin launched what became known as the Great Purge.
Thousands of party members, including many leaders who had worked closely with Lenin, were targeted.
Among the people accused of treason and shot was Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Russia’s most brilliant military commander who had been awarded the highest rank in the country, Marshall of the Soviet Union.
There is considerable debate about the number of people killed under Stalin’s rule.
At the time, most of the world’s communists either refused to believe or tried to justify Stalin’s excesses, and his regime certainly did not advertise its deeds.
The low estimates are 10 to 15 million killed and the high estimates of non-war-related deaths reach 60 to 65 million.
One of the advocates for the 60 million number was Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a Russian dissident author who had been sent to Siberia when accused of writing anti-Soviet propaganda in 1945 (while an officer in the Red Army), and who won the Nobel Prize for his writing in 1970.
Strikes in the industrial north and_ agitation by landless peasants in the agrarian south were suppressed only with great difficulty by the government, From 1925, Mussolini styled himself Il Duce a multi-party parliamentary eeteden democracy with a figurehead king.
Since the 1870s, constant shifting of political coalitions, cabinets, and prime ministers had resulted in governments that were barely ready for war—the Italians had little to show for the nearly 750,000 dead soldiers who fought the Austro-Hungarians to a draw in the Alps.
The government was even less prepared for what seemed to be an imminent Red revolution.
Mussolini had begun his political career as a revolutionary socialist before World War I However, he despised the pacifism of Italian socialism and became a convinced nationalist.
He served in the war; like Germany’s Adolf Hitler, reaching the rank of corporal.
In addition to being anti-socialist, Fascism was anti-liberal and anti-democratic.
Mussolini and his followers believed that parliaments were ineffective talk-fests of corrupt politicians that should be replaced by strong authoritarian leaders.
Although fascists in Italy and the rest of Europe participated in elections, they did so with a high level of organized street violence by their own paramilitary units against political opponents, especially socialists and communists.
Mussolini’s black-shirted squadristi were imitated by the Nazi brownshirts in Germany and the Falangist blue-shirts in Spain, among many others in the rest of Europe and the Americas.
Not only did they break up rival political meetings, they also brutally attacked strikers and labor organizers.
He went on to impose “totalitarianism”, his word for state control over the entire social and economic life of the nation.
Claiming that they were protecting private property against socialism, fascists actually created a form of state corporatism that was every bit as autocratic as Stalin’s system but retained the appearance of private ownership.
The establishment of corporate groups supported the claim that a wide array of political parties was no longer necessary; but in reality, the selection of leaders was limited to members of the official state party.
Mussolini and other fascists wanted to impose upon their countries military discipline and unquestioning loyalty to the leader.
Imperial expansion became a priority and war was encouraged to bring grandeur to the nation and strengthen its people.
Fascism gained ground more slowly in most other countries in the 1920s, until the onset of the Great Depression.
Italy did not seem to suffer as acutely from the social, labor and political unrest that came with the unexpected international economic crisis because the Italian opposition had been eliminated or jailed years before.
For property-owners and capitalists, fascism was a defense against revolutionary communism, while even for some in the working class, it seemed to provide a degree of social and political stability that democracy was struggling to retain.
The Great Depression The exact causes of the Great Depression are still being argued by historians and economists.
An ongoing agricultural recession in the United States and abroad during the 1920s was an important element, as was a Wall Street stock market bubble caused by excessive use of margin to buy company shares.
Investors were able to buy the shares of companies for pennies on the dollar by borrowing 90% to 97% of the purchase price.
This allowed them to buy ten to twenty times the number of shares they could actually afford, with lenders putting up the rest.
This system works very well as long as prices continue to rise, and the extreme demand for stocks powered by marginbuying drove the prices ever higher.
Insider trading was also quite common, with secret “pools” of investors buying up stocks to inflate prices, waiting for others to join in the game, and then selling when the price reached a profitable new height.
During the 1920s, the value of the stock market doubled without a corresponding increase in corporation assets or earnings.
The market grew at a rate of over 20% per year while the economy shrank.
Most stock prices rose to levels that could not be explained by their assets or earnings, since industry was actually starting to feel the pinch of the agricultural recession.
Stock prices typically reflect the underlying value of the company; in the bubble they mostly reflected the buying frenzy.
When credit became a bit tighter and people began receiving margin calls and trying to sell more of these inflated shares than there were new buyers for, the bubble burst.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (the most popular average of the value of America’s largest stocks) had fallen nearly 5% the day before, and opened Black Thursday at 305.
As soon as the opening bell rang, the market began dropping fast on volume three times greater than normal.
The three major banks, Morgan, Chase, and National City, began buying 4 solemn crowd gathered outside the Stock heavily to try to stabilize the Exchange after the crash.29.
After this weeklong crash, the market continued sliding for the next three years.
The market lost 90% of its pre-Crash value, and would not reach the levels it had seen in September 1929 for another 25 years until 1954.
The sudden evaporation of the market, even though the prices of stocks had been ridiculously inflated, resulted in a collapse of lending.
Loan amounts had been based on these inflated asset values; the values had disappeared but the debt remained.
After foreclosing on bankrupt farmers, rural banks were stuck with farms whose worth continued to drop.
Smaller banks had also borrowed from larger banks, affecting the entire financial system.
Wall Street stopped lending money to Germany to pay its reparations to the Allies.
Worldwide, the cost of food and industrial goods dropped considerably as businesses sought to lessen the effect of losses.
But unemployment was so staggering that few farmers and workers had enough to pay for anything, even at rock-bottom prices.
Governments embraced protectionist high tariffs in a last-ditch effort to stimulate domestic industry; however, this led to a collapse of global free trade which hurt the world economy even more.
In their desperation, people everywhere began to question the effectiveness of capitalism and liberal democracy to resolve the crisis—indeed, many began to blame liberalism and market capitalism for their sudden impoverishment.
Many saw the Soviet Union as a new model for economic stability, especially because Stalin was claiming the success of his Five Year Plans and no one knew what was going on behind the scenes.
Although labor unrest and mass protests broke out all over, Mussolini seemed to be maintaining order in Italy.
Also, fascists did not seek to end capitalism and private property like the communists promised to do.
Many in the middle class supported new fascist-inspired governments as a_ better guarantee of their livelihoods than the liberal democracy that seemed to have failed them.
This is essentially the story of how a minor political figure, Adolf Hitler, was able to become Chancellor of Germany in January 1983, as we will see below.
In the United States, bread lines became common, although Republican President Herbert Hoover, elected in 1928, insisted things weren't as bad as they appeared.
Shanty-towns and tent villages began appearing all over the country and were ironically nicknamed Hoovervilles.
The American Legion, formed in 1919 by World War I veterans, agitated for the early payment of military bonuses that had been awarded after the Great War but could not be redeemed until 1945.
A “Bonus Army” formed and marched on Washington to demonstrate, setting up a Hooverville in Washington and camping on the lawn outside the Capitol Building.
Hoover ordered his Secretary of War to disperse the protestors, and in July 1932 United States troops armed with tanks and machine guns attacked and burned the bonus camp, killing a few of their former comrades in the process.
Hoover lost the 1932 election to the Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, who issued an executive order enrolling 25,000 veterans in the Civilian Conservation Corps.
In 1986 Congress authorized the early payment of $2 billion in World War I bonuses.
The Russian Revolution and World War I had reduced European farm production and had driven up the price of American grain in international markets.
Marginal high plains grazing lands in western Kansas and Nebraska, Oklahoma and northwestern Texas were put under the plow.
Cropland in this region doubled between 1900 and 1920, and then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.
As European agriculture recovered, grain prices began to drop, so United States farmers planted more to try and earn the same amount.
A farmer and his two sons during a dust storm in Cimarron County, Oklahoma, April 1936.
Plowing fields for annual corn and wheat planting is such a common farming practice, it seemed normal to continue the practice as farmers expanded westward.
However, on the high plains, perennial grasses had evolved to find water deep in the soil and hold onto it.
The western edge of the prairie was actually a completely different ecosystem from the eastern edge by the Great Lakes, but the change in climate was very gradual.
Although many farmers moving west to convert the high plains rangeland to cultivation failed to notice it, rainfall was scarcer and the wind blew harder.
Over half a million people were left homeless when the topsoil blew away.
On Black Sunday, April 14, 1935, dust storms were reported A dust storm approaches Stratford, Texas, ; in 1935. from the Canadian border to Texas.
Newspaper reporters throughout the affected area wrote that they could not see five feet through the blowing dust.
The agricultural disaster that became known as the Dust Bowl caused an exodus from the high plains region.
Of 116,000 refugee families surveyed on their entrance into California, only four out of ten were farmer families.
A full third of the heads of families who fled Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas were white collar professionals.
However, US. democracy proved _ stable enough that the voters simply changed the party in power in the 1982 elections, from the Republicans to the Democrats.
Franklin D Roosevelt was inaugurated president a few weeks after Hitler took power’ in Germany.
Roosevelt was neither a communist nor a Herbert Hoover and Franklin D Roosevelt fascist, although he did accept on Inauguration Day, 1933. a degree of government intervention in the economy to alleviate the worst effects of the crisis.
Roosevelt saw the role that Wall Street had in the crisis, and wanted to restore confidence in the banking system.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is insurance, paid for by banks, which guarantees that depositors will receive their savings , in case of a bank failure.
FDIC helped bring an end to “runs on banks” by increasing people’s confidence in the banking system.
The Securities and Exchange Commission was a new agency that would oversee Wall Street.
New regulations put an end to “pooling” and other forms of stock manipulation and insider trading, in order to restore confidence in the stock exchange.
Borrowing money “on margin” to invest in stocks is still closely regulated.
In agriculture, the Roosevelt Administration began paying farmers not to over-plant and stabilized farm prices with the Agricultural Adjustment Act.
Agricultural Extension programs also taught new farming methods to prevent a future Dust Bowl.
Public Works Administration construction of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington.
The Works Progress Administration included large building projects like the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge, but also many smaller local projects like sidewalks, post offices and schools.
TVA dams controlled the flow of rivers to prevent flooding and to provide electricity to factories and rural homes.
Governments throughout the world sent representatives to see how it worked.

Instead of the government siding with industry and sending troops to put down strikes as in it had in the past, the Wagner Act legalized unions and strikes, and set up the National Labor Relations Board to arbitrate between industry and labor in contract disputes.
The Nazis In the 1920s, Germans had elected moderate, social democratic governments.
The disruption caused by the collapse of Wall Street and world trade especially affected German industry.
Previously, communists and National Socialists had been fringe parties, easily ignored.
But as Germans became increasingly desperate, they looked for easy solutions, or at least someone to blame for the crisis of world capitalism.
Political conflicts took to the streets, with social democrats fighting communists and both groups fighting Nazis.
Adolf Hitler, at the window of the Reich Chancellery, greets cheering crowds on the evening of his inauguration as chancellor, 30 January 1933 Meanwhile, intrigues began swirling around President Otto von Hindenberg, who was responsible for choosing a politician to take the role of Chancellor and form a government.
The aristocrats believed Hitler could be controlled; he had other ideas.
They even had their own paramilitary force with uniforms and insignia, and a powerful symbol in _ the swastika.
The Nazis also appealed to many voters because of their consistent opposition to the Versailles Treaty, which nearly all Germans blamed for their economic distress.
In 1934, Hitler became Germany's head of Nazis, the Versailles peace was _ state with the title of Fuhrer und a national humiliation and Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor of the Reich). the real reason that Germans **""” were unemployed.
During the campaign, the Reichstag building was burned down by a disgruntled communist; Hitler used this incident to arrest Communist politicians.
Although once again the Nazis failed to win a majority in the election, Hitler was granted neardictatorial powers.
By the end of the year, all other parties were outlawed or dissolved; by mid-1934, Hitler purged his own party of “left-Nazis,” eliminating all organized opposition.
Hindenberg’s death the following year allowed Hitler to combine the offices of President and Chancellor, so that the democratic Weimar constitution was a completely dead letter.
This was a remarkable achievement for Hitler, who until World War I had been a frustrated Austrian artist living in Vienna, absorbing extremist German nationalist and anti364 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford Semitic ideologies.
He had joined the German army at the beginning of the war; after the armistice, he was assigned by the army to observe and report on the various political groups that were appearing in Munich.
In 1920, he adopted the ancient Hindu swastika symbol in his design for the party’s flag.
After an attempted coup failed in Munich, Hitler was imprisoned in 1923.
While in prison, he wrote Mein Kampf an outline of his plan for the domination of the pure German “Aryan race” over Europe.
Hitler’s anti-Semitism blended with his hatred of “foreign” Bolshevism, and he imagined German “Aryans” as Europe’s defense against Jews and socialism.
Nazi focus on racial hatred set them apart from the Fascists in Italy, although anti-Semitic ideas were shared by other nationalists and fascists in Europe.
Hitler and the Nazis, like the Fascists in Italy, built their power by appealing to people’s worst prejudices and to their feelings of resentment that their problems were someone else’s fault.
As a group, they were perceived as being more successful in academia, the professions, and business than their Christian counterparts.
Close study of scripture was respected and _ encouraged, and these habits were quickly applied to careers in law, Benito Mussolini with Hitler on 25 October yy edicine and science once 1936, when the axis between Italy and P Germany was declared, Jews were liberated from the ghettos.
It was easy to blame Jews for the economic and social problems facing Europe in the 1980s, especially since they were believed by many to not fully be part of the “nation,” but rather a separate international community that divided their loyalty away from the fatherland.
Incongruently, the Nazis claimed that Jews were behind both Communism and the international banking and financial system that Communists wanted to destroy—a Jewish cabal was supposedly fomenting every crisis in a complex (and nonsensical) conspiracy theory.
Still, in the mid-19380s, Hitler’s popularity in Germany was not initially based on Nazi racism.
The Nazis suppressed labor unions, but work projects like building the Autobahn superhighway put men back to work.
Hitler called for an _ affordable “people’s car”, and in 19387 his Adolf Hitler laying the foundation stone of government built a statethe Volkswagen factory near Fallersleben on 26 May 1938.
Ferdinand owned factory €0 porsche at far right. manufacture a design created by race-car designer, Ferdinand Porsche.
The original Volksauto would be available to German citizens for $396 through a government-sponsored savings plan.
In early 1936, when he moved troops to the French border, the Allies did not respond militarily; much to the surprise of many German generals.
Berlin successfully hosted the Olympics in July 1936, showcasing the regime to the world while also starting the tradition of lighting an Olympic flame brought from Greece by relay runners.
Almost immediately after Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis called for a boycott of Jewish-owned businesses and Jews were fired from government positions.
The 1935 Nuremberg Laws prohibited marriage with Jews and defined Jewishness based on ancestors.
Warlords (army generals and minor regional nobility) quickly organized troops to bring order to the countryside.
However, they were not interested in respecting or The Kuomintang reveres its founder, Sun supporting the new republic, Yat-sen, as the “Father of the Nation” which was seen as a European novelty.
In the power struggle between Sun Yat-sen and General Yuan Shih-kai, the head of the Imperial Army, Yuan won.
Instead of Sun Yat-Sen, a warlord became president of the republic under the new constitution.
In the chaos of the republic’s early years, remote imperial provinces were able to establish their own nations, separate from China.
Mongolia is still independent, while Tibet was reconquered by Mao Zedong in the 1950s and is still seeking independence.
After Yuan’s death in 1916, cliques and civil conflict broke out between the republic and the warlords.
Yuan had declared himself emperor in 1915, and additional provinces had broken away in protest.
Sun and the nationalists experienced a resurgence on May 4, 1919, when students revolted in Beijing against the Versailles Treaty, in which Japan received the German protectorates in Shandong province, rather than China.
These demonstrations marked an _ important modernizing moment for the new Republic.
As the struggle continued against the northern warlords, Sun died of cancer in 1925, and his protege, General Chiang Kai-shek took over the Kuomintang.
In 1927, Chiang married U.S.educated Soong Mei-ling, the sister of Sun’s widow Soong Ching-ling.
By 1927, the “Northern Expedition” against the warlords was successful, led by Chiang with CCP and Soviet support.
A few months later, Sun Yat-sen and Chiang however, a new civil war ‘@shek began in China.
Chiang turned against his communist allies, who he feared were strengthening their support in the cities.
Chiang purged CCPmembers from the Kuomintang, and beginning in the commercial and financial capital in Shanghai, began rounding up and executing many Communist leaders, while imprisoning others.
In 1931, the Japanese military invaded Manchuria and created the puppet Kingdom of Manchukuo, installing the heir to the Qing dynasty, Pu Yi, as the monarch.
The Chinese Republic, in the midst of a new civil war, was not in a position to fight the Japanese.
The Nationalist armies reconquered parts of Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong China’s interior under in Yan’an in 1937, shortly after the Long Communist control March. , surrounding the communists in the Jiangxi Province in October 1934.
The CCP forces broke out of the trap and began what became known as the Long March.
In 3870 days, the communists covered 5,600 miles including some of the most rugged terrain in china.
Mao Zedong gradually emerged as a leader of the CCP, along with Red Army leader Zhou Enlai.
As seen in previous chapters, by embracing western technology and government, Japan went in the opposite direction of China in the late 19th and early 20th century.
By 1910 the Japanese Empire had extended its territory to include the Ryuku Islands and Taiwan, had defeated the Russians in the 1905 war, and had taken control of the Korean peninsula.
Japanese industrial goods, especially textiles, found markets in the United States and other parts of the world.
And as part of the victorious Allied coalition in the Great War, the Japanese were awarded the Marshall Islands and Shandong peninsula from Germany, although their proposal to condemn racism was not approved by the Allied diplomats in Paris.
Japan enjoyed a parliamentary monarchy, with political parties, trade unions, a parliament, and a “divine” emperor.
In international affairs, the civilian government joined the World War I allies in an effort to decrease the militarization of the Pacific and East Asia and agreed to maintaining a smaller navy in the Pacific than either the United States or Great Britain in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty.
They advocated a Japan that would dominate East Asia, eventually replacing European rule and influence.
As the reign of the new Emperor Hirohito began in 1926, the nationalist resurgence continued in the military, taking over Japanese foreign policy at the beginning of the Great Depression.
The protectionism of many countries in the wake of the international financial crisis harmed the exportdependent Japanese economy.
In 1981, an “incident” was staged by Japanese forces in Manchuria, giving Japan an excuse to take the region Manchuria from China.
The civilian Japanese government was not in a position to reverse the conquest of Manchuria by their own military.
Japanese diplomats ended up defending the takeover at the League of Nations.
In late 1936, Japan united with Germany in an_ AntiComintern Treaty in opposition to the Soviet Union and communism.
The Japanese Empire would bring order and prosperity to an Asia, “for the Asians” through the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
Japanese imperialism seemed like an attractive proposition to some in East Asia who wanted to rid themselves of European imperial rule.
As mentioned previously, the British trained and educated locals in India as soldiers, police, government administrators, and professionals in the nineteenth century in order to run the Empire, claiming they were preparing India for eventual selfrule.
When the promised self-rule would begin became a source of debate and conflict between the colonizers and the colonized.
They believed they were already administering the country and no longer needed British bureaucrats to tell them what to do.
After the war, this service inspired increased agitation for independence.
However, reacting to racial discrimination, he in|, Studio photograph of Mohandas K Gandhi, began to organize on behalf London, 1931. of non-whites.
Popular calls for complete independence from Britain were accelerated by the horrific Amritsar Massacre in 1919, in which the British army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians.
Increasing protests against British rule had led to oppressive measures, including the prohibition of public gatherings.
In Amritsar, a religious celebration was interpreted as a political demonstration by the local British administrator, and he ordered his troops to open fire.
The following year, Gandhi led his famous Salt March protest against the British salt monopoly.
The British controlled the production and sale of salt, so Gandhi led a massive march to the sea to illegally make salt from the ocean.
Non-violently disobeying an absurd law effectively highlighted the futility of Britain’s position in India.
The British Parliament responded with the Government of India Act in 1935, which established regional legislatures.
Voting was arranged by religious and social categories, applying a “divide and conquer” method that the British had been using since the nineteenth century.
They were radically in favor of independence, but also encouraged democracy.
The asceticism and simplicity of Gandhi was an example to be emulated, not a way of life imposed from above.
Indian ideas and techniques would become an example for other struggles by colonized peoples and oppressed minorities, directly influencing the course of decolonization and the struggle for civil rights by African-Americans in the United States after World War Two.
In many ways World War Two was a continuation of World War One, especially in Europe.
The Nazi regime promised to reverse all of it, and place a powerful new German Empire as the dominant force on the continent—and perhaps the world.
However, World War Two was also a result of the worldwide reaction to the Great Depression, which was seen by many as not only a failure of capitalism, but also a failure of democracy.
Fascism and communism seemed to some to offer the only plausible reactions to the crisis—remember that although neither the Nazi nor the Communist parties in the German Weimar Republic ever won a majority in a contested election, by 1932 most German voters opted for one or the other, and essentially voting against liberal democracy.
Germany was not alone in abandoning democracy and _ embracing authoritarianism—the same happened all over Eastern and Central Europe, Latin America, and, most importantly, Japan.
The last chapter presented how the Japanese military, taking the initiative against the weak objections of Japan’s elected government, initiated the conflict that would become World War Two by invading and occupying the northern Chinese province of Manchuria in 1931.
While Hitler was % still consolidating the Nazi % regime and rebuilding German armed forces in violation of the Versailles Treaty, Mussolini decided to act.
In October 1935 Italy invaded independent Ethiopia from its colonies in Eritrea and Somalia.
The Italians had been defeated by Ethiopian King Haile Selassie on cover of the Ethiopians in 1896; this Time magazine, November 1930 time was different.
Using air power and poison gas, Mussolini’s military swept through Ethiopia.
By the end of 1986, most pockets of Ethiopian resistance were defeated.
In April 1936, Ethiopian King Haile Selassie went to the League of Nations to ask for help, but the League had no army to attack Mussolini’s.
Emboldened by the ineffectiveness of world opinion, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia was brutal.
In February 1937, in response to an attempted assassination on the new Italian viceroy in the capital city, Addis Ababa, Italians went on a threeday killing spree to exact vengeance on the Ethiopians.
At least 20,000 were murdered, including Ethiopian intellectuals who had already been imprisoned in wretched conditions.
As we'll see, such atrocities were typical of the racism inherent in fascist regimes, who thought that using such terror was the only way to “teach a lesson” to “inferior” conquered peoples.
After losing most of its Latin American colonies in the early nineteenth century, Spain fell into decades of civil wars.
By the time Spain lost the Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898, the Spanish empire was less stable and poorer than several of its former territories such as Argentina and Chile.
In the early years of the new century, Spanish workers were inspired by socialism and anarchism, the belief that taking down all forms of repression would liberate the natural socialist and communal tendencies of humanity.
Many found fault with the Catholic Church, which received government funds to educate and provide welfare for the poor, but was seen as ineffective and hypocritically enjoying its own riches by the starving, illiterate, and landless peasants and proletarians.
The king abdicated—another victim of the crisis of the Great Depression—and a Spanish Republic was established.
A new Spanish constitution formed a presidentialparliamentary government with proportional representation, much like the Weimar Republic in Germany.
Rebellions by radical miners in northern Spain in 1934 led to repression and the imprisonment of thousands, leading to the formation of a “Popular Front” government in February 1936 after very close elections.
Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered the world’s communist parties to join anti-fascist Popular Front coalitions.
The Spanish Popular Front government WaS a coalition of socialist, anarchist, and workers _ parties seeking to preserve — and Francisco Franco in 1930 extend liberal reforms.
However, when the new government rolled out agrarian reforms and began suppressing the Church, street fighting and assassinations led to a fascistsupported military coup orchestrated by General Francisco Franco in July, 1936.
Although the “nationalists” took control of northern and western Spain, the fascists were stopped in the region around Madrid and Barcelona by socialist and anarchist workers who had been armed by the Republican government.
The leading European democracies—Great Britain and France—declared neutrality while the United States chose once again to try to stay out of Europe’s disputes.
However, even before Franco and the nationalists finally defeated the Republic in April 1939, Stalin had pulled Soviet advisors out of Spain and abandoned the Popular Front strategy.
Francisco Franco remained the authoritarian dictator of Spain until his death in 1975.
By the 1930s, and the Great Depression, the French, British, and Americans were wondering what “winning” the Great War had really meant.
The deaths of millions and the wounding of millions more did not seem worth repeating.
The Germans, on the other hand, had been humiliated by the peace and were now led by a man, and a party, that claimed that they could have won if they had not been “stabbed in the back” by liberals, social democrats, and Jews.
There was truth in the observation that bankers and capitalists had profited from the war, but there was no evidence of a conspiracy.
The fact that public opinion descended into fantastic conspiracy theories is a testament to the psychological effect of the worldwide economic crisis on a fearful humanity.
Lebensraum, living space, for Aryans would be taken from the Slavic peoples of eastern Europe.
Hitler set his sights on the Sudetenland, an ethnically German region of Czechoslovakia.
In October 1988, the British and French leaders, alarmed but still anxious to avoid war, attended a diplomatic conference in Munich where they agreed that Hitler could annex the Sudetenland in return for a promise to stop all future German aggression.
They were desperate to believe the Fiihrer could be appeased, but in March 1989, German troops rolled into the rest of Czechoslovakia.
The Czechoslovak government had not even been invited to the conference in Munich; despite being the only democracy standing in Central Europe by 1938, they were betrayed by the appeasement policy of their fellow democracies.

In November 19388, after a German diplomat was assassinated by an exiled German Jew in France, the Nazi government allowed a massive outpouring of violence against Jews and Jewish-owned businesses.
German mobs murdered dozens of Jews, publicly humiliated thousands, and burned businesses and synagogues.
Many people in the democracies were outraged, thinking that such a pogrom was only impossible in a civilized nation like Germany.
However, no government took action against Hitler, nor did any country accept Jewish refugees—anti-Semitism was all too common in most “civilized” countries.
All of this was happening as Stalin was still supporting the Spanish Republic, hoping that the democracies would join in a struggle against rising fascism.
When they instead appeased Hitler, Stalin concluded that the capitalists perceived Hitler as a bulwark against the communist Soviet Union rather than as a threat to their own territories and interests.
The Soviet Premier changed his diplomatic strategy and Stalin and German Foreign Minister on August 23, 1939 signed a Ribbentrop shaking hands after the signing Non-Aggression Pact with of the non-aggression pact in the Kremlin.
By that time, Hitler had set his sights on “liberating” the German-speaking population in Poland and their territory.
The world learned of the secret agreement to divide Poland included in the NaziSoviet Pact when the Stalin sent his armies into eastern Poland three weeks later.
The Road to War in East Asia As described in the previous chapter, the government ruling in the name of Japanese Emperor Hirohito also shifted toward fascism after the invasion of Manchuria in 1981 and the establishment of the puppet state Manchukuo in northeast China and Inner Mongolia.
The Japanese military also justified their conquests by claiming they were liberating Asia from European colonialism.
The United States supported the Chinese protest, and after a six-month investigation, the League found Japan guilty and demanded the return of Manchuria to China.
The diplomats of the League had no way to enforce their ruling, of course.
Japan ignored the demand and simply withdrew from the League of Nations.
Japanese diplomatic isolation further empowered radical military leaders who could point to Japanese military success in Manchuria and compare it to the diplomatic failures of the civilian government.
In the military’s eyes, the conquest of China would not only provide for Japan’s industrial needs, it would secure Japanese supremacy in East Asia.
The broken Chinese army gave up Beijing to the Japanese on August 8, Shanghai on November 26, and the Nationalist capital, Nanjing, on December 18.
TRey began by Japanese officer. executing 90,000 Chinese Army deserters who they despised for surrendering, and then moved on to civilians.
To pacify the rest, the Japanese distributed opium and heroin to the captive population.
Like the Italian fascists in Ethiopia and the German Nazis in occupied Europe, the Japanese military felt themselves to be superior to the conquered peoples, and believed that only terror could subdue the civilian population.
His Nationalist government retreated inland, burning villages and destroying dams; in the process killing more Chinese peasants than the Japanese had killed in the atrocities in Nanjing.
Chiang established a new capital deep in the interior at the Yangtze River port of Chungking.
When news of the “Rape of Nanjing” first reached the West, many were skeptical because the violence was so extreme.
However, United States missionaries and European businessmen had established an “International Safety Zone” in Nanjing during the atrocities, which saved 200,000 Chinese civilians and documented the Japanese actions.
Eyewitness accounts written by Westerners were published in American newspapers, along with photographic evidence, and the brutality of Japanese imperialism began to sink in.
The Japanese army was a technologically advanced force consisting of 4,100,000 men and 900,000 Chinese collaborators armed with modern rifles, artillery, armor, and aircraft.
By 1940, the Japanese navy was the third-largest and among the most technologically advanced in the world.
Chiang Kaishek’s popular wife, U.S.-educated Soong May-ling, known to Americans as Madame Chiang, led the effort.
In contrast to her gruff husband, Madame Chiang was charming and able to use her knowledge of American culture and values to garner Madame Chiang Kai-Shek and Eleanor Roosevelt on the White House lawn. support for Chiang and his government.
But although the United States denounced Japanese aggression, it took no action.
Mao Zedong recognized the power of the Chinese peasant population and began recruiting from the local peasantry, capitalizing on the outrage caused by both the Nationalist failure to prevent Japanese invasion and its scorched-earth retreat.
Mao gradually built his force from a meager seven thousand survivors at the end of the Long March in 1935 to a robust 1. million members by the end of the World War Two.
Axis Conquests in Europe and Asia German column of panzers and mechanised infantry advancing through Ukraine, June 1942, typifying fast-moving advances of Blitzkrieg.
Two days after the German Wehrmacht invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Britain and France declared war and began mobilizing their armies.
The war planners hoped the Poles would be able to hold out for three to four months, enough time for the Allies to intervene.
Poland fell in three weeks, partly due to the Russian invasion in the east and partly due to a new form of warfare.
The German army, anxious to avoid the rigid, grinding war of attrition in the trenches of World War I, had built its new army for speed and maneuverability.
German strategy emphasized the use of tanks, planes, and motorized infantry to concentrate forces, smash front lines, and wreak havoc behind the enemy’s defenses.
Meanwhile, after the fall of Poland, France and Britain braced for the inevitable German attack.
In April 1940, the Germans quickly conquered Denmark and Norway in an effort to prevent the British naval blockade which had been so key to the German defeat in World War One.
The following month, Hitler launched his blitzkrieg into Western Europe through the Netherlands and Belgium to avoid well-prepared French defenses along the French-German border.
By June, Hitler was posing for photographs in front of the Eiffel Tower.
In another propaganda victory, Hitler made the French diplomats sign their surrender in the same railroad car used for the German surrender in the First World War.
Germany split France in half, occupying the north and allowing a_ collaborationist government to form in Vichy to govern the south and the French colonies.
Led by the “Hero of Verdun,’ Marshal Philippe Petain, the Vichy regime sought to reorganize France along authoritarian fascist _ lines.
Many in France had also abandoned democracy and welcomed the demise of the Third Republic.
If the future held a German-dominated Europe, they reasoned, then it would be better for France to collaborate as partners rather than as subjects in a new Naziempire.
Although this rationalization fit into the scheme proposed by German propaganda, Hitler would never allow a full partnership with any of the conquered peoples.
Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of the British Isles, required air superiority over the English Channel.
From June until October 1940, the German Luftwaffe fought the Royal Air Force for control of the skies.
But if Britain was safe from invasion, it was not immune from ongoing air attacks.
Frustrated by losing the Battle of Britain, Hitler began a bombing campaign against cities and civilians.
Population centers like Bristol, Cardiff, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Southampton and industrial cities like Swansea, Belfast, Birmingham, Coventry, Glasgow, Manchester, and Sheffield were also targeted for heavy bombing.
The Royal Air Force defended the cities as well as they could, and British industrial production which had been moved out of major cities was unaffected by the air attacks.
In anger, Hitler and his Vice Chancellor Herman Goring began a policy of hitting London every day to try to break the will of their enemy.
Beginning on September 7 1940, London was bombed every night for 56 days, including a large daylight attack on September 15.
British morale failed to break, and Germany — eventually shifted to targeting Atlantic shipping and bombing port cities in an attempt to starve the enemy.
When the port of Clydebank in Scotland was Original 1939 poster bombed in March, 1941, only 7 of 12,000 houses escaped damage.
But the Germans failed to gain complete air superiority, partly due to the deployment of RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) by the British.
The technology had been developed in the 1930s and was advanced and finally perfected by Britain in the early 1940s.
It would be offered to the Americans in exchange for financial and industrial support as the two nations strengthened ties to “defend democracy” even before United States involvement in the war.
Nazi ideology considered the English as racial equals, and Hitler hoped that Great Britain would eventually join a crusade against Bolshevism.
Hitler had always planned on breaking his 1939 nonaggression pact with Stalin and invading the Soviet Union.
First, German armies invaded the Balkans and set up puppet regimes in Hungary and Romania, giving them a wider front for attacking the Soviets.
Mussolini, playing catch-up with his Axis partner, had sent his troops to conquer Greece from Albania, which Italy had acquired in April 1939.
The Greeks not only defended themselves, but pushed the Italians back into Albania; Hitler had to bail out Mussolini and invade, sending his armies into Yugoslavia and Greece.
In June 1941, German forces crossed into the Soviet Union ina massive surprise attack.
France and Poland had fallen in weeks, and Germany hoped to use the same Blitzkrieg tactics to break Russia before the winter.
The German military caught the Red Army and Stalin unprepared and quickly conquered enormous swaths of land and captured nearly three million prisoners.
After recovering from the initial shock of the German invasion, Stalin moved his factories east of the Urals, out of range of the Luftwaffe.
He ordered his retreating army to adopt a scorched earth policy, destroying food, rails, and shelters to slow the advancing German army.
The placard reads “We are the partisans who shot German troops”, Minsk, October 26, 1941 The German army split into three forces and reached the gates of Moscow and Leningrad, but their supply lines stretched thousands of miles.
Soviet infrastructure had been destroyed, partisans harried German lines, and the brutal Russian winter arrived.
Germany had won massive gains but the winter found German troops exhausted and overextended.
In the center, on the outskirts of Moscow, the German army faltered and fell back after a three-month battle that killed a million people.
In 1939 the United States dissolved its trade treaties with Japan and the following year America cut off supplies of war materials by embargoing oil, steel, rubber, and other vital goods.
Instead of being starved into submission, Japan’s resource-challenged military accelerated invasions across East Asia to sustain its war effort.
The Japanese took control of French Indochina from the Vichy Regime, and began threatening the Dutch East Indies after the Netherlands was occupied by Germany.
The United States demanded that Japan withdraw from China and the French and Dutch territories; Japan considered the oil embargo a de facto declaration of war.

On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise air attack from their carriers on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
Japanese military planners hoped to destroy enough battleships and aircraft carriers to cripple American naval power for years.
Luckily for the United States Navy, its aircraft carriers were out on maneuvers and not at port during the attack.
Japan also assaulted Hong Kong, the Philippines, and American holdings throughout the Pacific, but it was the attack on Hawaii that threw the United States into a global conflict.
Franklin Roosevelt called December 7 “a date which will live in infamy” and called for a declaration of war, which Congress approved within hours.

Take off from the deck of the USS HORNET of an Army B-25 on its way to take part in first United States air raid on Japan, the Doolittle Raid, April 1942.
However, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill understood that Germany was a more immediate threat.
Roosevelt and Churchill met in April 1941 and declared the Atlantic Charter—a pledge to defend freedom and democracy from fascism.
After the United States officially entered the war, Hitler unleashed U-boat ‘wolf packs” into the Atlantic Ocean with orders to sink anything carrying aid to Britain.
After losing thousands of merchant ships in 1942 and early 1943, British and United States tactics and technology won the Battle of A complete and working replica of the computer Turing invented to break the Enigma cypher, called a “Bombe”, at the the Atlantic.
British code British National Museum of Computing at_— breakers at Bletchley Park led Serine ra by Alan Turing cracked Germany’s Enigma _ radio cryptography.
The surge of intelligence, dubbed Ultra, coupled with naval convoys escorted by destroyers armed with sonar and depth charges and air support, gave the advantage to the Allies.
By mid-1943, Hitler’s navy was losing ships faster than they could be built.
Soon the wolf pack was sheltering in a defensive crouch in the harbors of occupied Europe.
Reflect on the technological developments that were accelerated by the war.
The Blitzkrieg again brought rapid success, but again got too far ahead of its supply lines.
Although the strategy included sophisticated tanks, armored troop carriers, and dive bombers, the Germans still used horsedrawn wagons to bring up food, ammunition and spare parts to the advancing armies.
As the advance slowed, Axis armies arrived at the new industrial city on the Volga River, Stalingrad.
Hitler badly wanted to conquer and wipe out Stalin’s namesake city, and the Soviet Premier was just as determined to defend it.
In late 1942, the two armies bled themselves to death in the destroyed city; fighting house to house in a five-month battle that killed nearly two million people on both sides.
Stalin placed his trust in General Georgy Zhukov, who planned a brilliant Soviet pincer move, cutting off the German 6th army in Stalingrad.
When his army was forced to surrender in February 1943, Hitler was apoplectic in his anger and his generals began to doubt that he any longer had the strategic brilliance he showed in the previous years.
The Germans planned to follow up with renewed attacks to get at Soviet oil, but their battle with the Red Army at Kursk turned the course of the war definitively to the Soviets.
Zhukov correctly guessed the German strategy, and fortified Kursk while massing armies to the north and south.
After the greatest tank battle in world history, Zhukov unleashed another pincer move, and the Germans retreated from 1944 portrait photograph of Georgy battle as quickly as they Zhukov.
The Red Army began rolling westward, putting the Germans permanently on the defensive for the remainder of the war.
More than any other Ally, the Soviet Union was most responsible for defeating Hitler, but at great sacrifice.
Twentyfive million Soviet soldiers and civilians died in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War, and roughly 80 percent of all German casualties during the war came on the Eastern Front.
The Germans and Italians had been threatening British Egypt since late 1940, and led by the capable General Erwin Rommel, seemed to be on the brink of victory in the spring of 1942.
Hitler’s decision to invade southern Russia was based on the expectation that the Middle East would soon fall into Axis hands.
In November, the first American combat troops entered the European war, landing in French Morocco, where French Vichy forces switched sides and joined the struggle to defeat the Axis.
The Americans pushed the Germans and Italians eastward while the British, after defeating Rommel at El Alamein in Egypt, began rolling the Axis armies back to the west.
By early 1943, the Allies had pushed Axis forces into Tunisia and then out of Africa.
Meanwhile, the Americans gradually stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific.
In the summer of 1942, American naval victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the aircraft carrier duel at the Battle of Midway crippled Japan’s Pacific naval operations.
The battles were the first time two naval fleets engaged one another by air and not by sea.
At Coral Sea, the United States Navy blocked the Japanese threat to Australia; Midway eliminated Japan’s advance toward Hawaii, while sinking three Japanese aircraft carriers which were irreplaceable, as Japan did not have the industrial capacity to replenish its fleet.
At Guadalcanal Japanese soldiers launched suicidal charges rather than surrender.
Many Japanese soldiers refused to be taken prisoner or to take prisoners themselves.
Such tactics, coupled with American racial prejudice, turned the Pacific Theater into a much more brutal and barbarous conflict than battle in the European Theater.
In January 1943, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met at Casablanca to discuss the next step of the European war.
The meeting leaders also declared that they expected nothing short of unconditional surrender from the Germans—to assure Stalin, who still did not trust the Allies to keep their word.
At Casablanca, Churchill convinced Roosevelt to chase the Axis up the Italian peninsula, into the “soft underbelly” of Europe.
Stalin preferred a_ cross-Channel invasion of France, but the British and Americans were not yet prepared in 1948.
In July, Allied forces led by General Dwight Eisenhower crossed the Mediterranean and landed in Sicily.
The Italian King dismissed and arrested Mussolini, who escaped with Germany’s help and established a fascist government in northern Italy.
The south, however, switched sides and fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war.
However, the advance northward toward Europe’s “soft underbelly” turned out to be much tougher than Churchill had imagined.
Italy’s narrow, mountainous terrain and Mussolini’s newly-formed fascist state gave the defending Axis the advantage.
Movement up the peninsula was slow, and in some battles, conditions returned to the trench-like warfare of World War I as the German armies fell back to new defensive positions, exhausting Allied forces in one battle after another.
Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Force sent thousands of bombers to England and North Africa in preparation for a massive Strategic bombing campaign against Germany—another move to assure Stalin the Allies were opening a “second front” against Germany.
Initially, United States bombers focused on destroying German ball-bearing factories, rail yards, oil fields, and manufacturing centers during the day because the United States was reluctant to target civilians in terror bombings.
However, after the London Blitz, the British felt no compunction against retaliating in kind, and carpet-bombed German cities at night.
By the end of 1944, the Americans joined the British in the same strategy, bombing urban industrial targets despite massive civilian casualties.
The joint RAF-USAAF bombing of the industrial city, Dresden, in February 1945, dropped 3,900 tons of high explosives on the city, causing a firestorm that killed 25,000 civilians.
However, advanced German technology allowed fighters to easily shoot down 8-29 “Super-fortress"" in flight during World the lumbering bombers.
German fighter planes shot down almost half of American and British aircraft until longrange escort fighters were developed that allowed the bombers hit their targets while fighters confronted opposing German aircraft.
The Germans actually increased production of war materiel during the war, relocating factories and streamlining production.
German and Japanese civilians, like the Londoners in 1940, learned to live with aerial attacks instead of rising up to overthrow their own governments and sue for peace.
Critics of terror-bombing argue that targeting civilians rarely results in surrender, and instead often stiffens a country’s resolve to fight on and inflict the same terror on its foe.
From left to right: Joseph Stalin, Franklin D Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill on the portico of the Russian Embassy during the Tehran Conference to discuss the European Theatre in 1943.
In the wake of the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met in Tehran in November 1948.
Dismissing Africa and Italy as a sideshow, Stalin demanded that Britain and the United States invade France to support the Soviet advance on the Eastern Front.
The leaders also began post-war planning, considering the best ways to prevent another world war and Great Depression.
The Allies had already begun calling themselves the “United Nations,” especially as Latin American republics and other countries began joining the fight against the Axis.
In April 1945, diplomats gathered in San Francisco to design a way for the United Nations to address world problems in a post-war world.
To avoid another Great Depression and to reconstruct wartorn nations, in 1944 the Allies also sent representatives to the Bretton Woods resort in New Hampshire to forge new international financial, trade, and developmental relationships.
Americans had become convinced that isolationism was not longer a practical foreign policy, and the world recognized that the United States was going to be instrumental in a post-war effort to keep the peace.
The Conclusion The photograph “Into the Jaws of Death” shows American troops, part of the United States 1st Infantry Division, leaving a Higgins Boat on Omaha Beach.
On the same day the American army entered Rome, American, British and Canadian forces launched Operation Overlord, the long-awaited invasion of France.
Using over 5,000 landing and assault craft, about 160,000 men crossed the English Channel on D-Day.
The Allied landings at Normandy were successful, and by the end of the month 875,000 Allied troops had arrived in France.
Allied bombing sorties intensified, continuing to level German cities and reduce Axis industrial capacity.
The Royal Air Force estimated that the Allies destroyed more than half of the “built up areas” in seven of the ten German cities with more than 500,000 residents.
The USAAF flew over 750,000 bomber sorties and dropped nearly a million and a half tons of bombs.
Up to five hundred thousand German civilians were killed by allied bombing.
The Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945 was the largest and deadliest single battle fought by United States troops in the war.
The desperate Germans failed to drive the Allies back from the Ardennes forests to the English Channel, but the delay cost the westernfront Allies the winter.
The invasion of Germany would have to wait, while the Soviet Union continued its relentless push from the east, ravaging German populations in retribution for German war crimes.
German counterattacks failed to prevent the Soviet advance and 1945 dawned with the end of European war in sight.
The Big Three met at Yalta in February 1945 to discuss their joint occupation of Germany and plans for postwar Europe.
In February 1945, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met again at Yalta, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the Black Sea.
Roosevelt and Churchill were anxious for Soviet help in defeating Japan; the atom bomb was months away from being tested and no one knew whether it would work.
The three leaders discussed their own long-range strategic interests at Yalta.
Stalin, whose country had sacrificed the most in the war, insisted on defending the Soviet Union from future invasion by occupying Eastern Europe.
Remembering British and United States support of the White Russians in the Civil War he had fought in the 1920s, Stalin distrusted his temporary allies against Germany.
Roosevelt’s main interest was maintaining the economic boom that had pulled the United States out of the Great Depression through free international trade.
The war had put people back to work and the nation was at near full employment.
Since United States was not bombed, American industry was in a position to supply the world and American firms to dominate world markets.
Although the three nations shared the victory in World War Two, in the long run, the United States “defeated” its allies.
The European empires Churchill hoped to save were ended by the 1960s with the independence of Asian and African colonies and Stalin’s Soviet Union and domination of Eastern Europe dramatically collapsed in 1989-1991.
Free trade exists throughout the world, and is currently embraced by industrially-developing nations as a means for economic growth.
In late April, American and Soviet troops met at the Elbe River while the Soviets pushed relentlessly to reach Berlin In an arranged photo commemorating the first and took the capital city meeting of the Soviet and American in May.

Of the “Big Three” who had met at Yalta, only Stalin was at Potsdam for the whole conference.
The leaders agreed that Germany would be divided into pieces according to current Allied occupation, with Berlin likewise divided.
The Holocaust We have already seen the application of fascist ideology in murderous atrocities against “inferior people” by the Italians in Ethiopia and the Japanese in China in the early years of World War Two.
Ten percent of Poland’s pre-war population was Jewish, about 3 million people, who had been subjected to discrimination by the authoritarian Polish government in the 1980s.
However, under German occupation, Jews were forced into overcrowded ghettoes in certain Polish cities.
The areas captured by the Wehrmacht in the western Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa added millions of Jews to Nazi-occupied Europe.
Mass shootings by specialized troops called Einsatzgruppen accompanied the invasion of the Soviet Union.
In October 1941, outside of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Jewish men were forced to dig mass pits in the Babi Yar ravine into which they and their families were herded naked and shot by Eznsatzgruppen and Ukrainian collaborators.
Officer executes those who survived the initial shooting, October 1942.
Non-Russians in these camps, Balts and Ukrainians, were given the option to join special guard units and collaborate with the Germans.
As the mass shootings took their psychological toll on German soldiers and guardsmen, these non-Germans were called upon to murder Jewish civilians and patrol the ghettoes and concentration camps.
Even before the war began, “mercy killing” had become a Nazi policy in German psychiatric and mental institutions, where those with physical and mental disabilities were denied care and murdered.
Fellow camps in the Eastern Europe, citizen, that is your money too.” the first opening in early 1942.
Jews were packed into railroad cattle-cars and taken to these camps, where they were told that they were going to “showers,” but instead were sealed in and gassed.
In all countries of occupied A page from Anne Frank's first diary, 1942.
Europe, some Jews were saved by their Christian neighbors, hidden in attics, barns, and even in churches and monasteries until the end of the war.
The German-Jewish Frank family had moved to the Netherlands to escape the Nazi regime in late 1933.
They had hoped that Holland would be a safe haven in a new European war since it had remained neutral in World War One.
However, the Germans occupied the country along with Belgium and France in 1940, and by 1942, were sending Dutch Jews in transports to the East.
The Frank family was able to hide in an annex with others, supplied with food and news of the war by a group of Dutch friends active in the underground resistance.
However, they were discovered by German authorities in August 1944, and sent off to the camps.
Young Anne Frank had kept a diary during their two years in hiding, and her father, who survived the war, published it in 1947.
Although Anne Frank’s diary has become one of the most important records of the Holocaust, the Germans themselves were good at keeping records of their actions against Jews and others.
New details emerge frequently of the extent and reach of the Holocaust, concentration camps, and slave labor.
However, during the war itself, it was difficult for the Allies to believe rumors and reports they were receiving of atrocities, mass executions, and death camps in Nazi-occupied Europe.
Polish resistance fighter Jan Karski was smuggled into the Warsaw ghetto and a transit camp in order to witness how the Jews were treated.
He saw teenage Hitler Youth members walking into the ghetto to casually murder a Jew or two and Jewish families destined for extermination packed into rail cars.
When Karski described what he had seen to United States Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, a Jewish-American, Frankfurter replied, “I know you are telling the truth, but I don’t believe you”; expressing the world’s incredulity that the Germans could perpetrate such atrocities.
Fritz Klein, the camp doctor, standing in a mass grave at Bergen-Belsen after the camp's liberation by the British 11th Armoured Division, April 1945 As the Allies pushed into Germany and Poland, they uncovered the full extent of Hitler’s genocidal policies.
Allied officers often forced German civilians to visit the camps in their towns and regions in order to witness the consequences of Nazi and fascist ideology that the “other” must be eliminated.
Since then, Germany has been forced to come to terms with this history, and most Germans have tried to confront their past honestly.
Europeans intentionally mass murdering other Europeans, and using industrial methods, was unacceptable.
The atrocities of Europeans against colonized peoples in Africa, Asia, and the American West seemed more acceptable, and were rarely addressed, due to a legacy of institutionalized racism.
But the violence was very real to the Congolese, Native Americans, Indians, and United States Blacks.
The attempted elimination of the entire Jewish population in Europe has had other geopolitical effects.
This was achieved in Israel three years after the war ended in Europe; but not, as we shall see, without long-term consequences for the Palestinian Arabs and the rest of the Middle East.
News of the death of six million Jews was especially difficult for JewishAmericans, who suddenly realized that they were nearly the last surviving remnant of an ancient people after their relatives and loved ones were murdered in Hitler’s camps.
Previously Jewish life had been centered in Poland and the Ukraine; now it was in the United States and Israel.
In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese military continue to fight tenaciously in defeat after defeat.
Few battles were as one-sided as the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, a Japanese counterattack that the Americans called the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot for the number of planes and vessels that they sank.
At Iwo Jima, an eight-square-mile island of volcanic rock upon United States postage stamp, 1945 issue, which the Americans wanted commemorating the Battle of Iwo Jima. to build an airfield from which to attack Japan, seventeen thousand Japanese soldiers held the island against seventy thousand Marines for over a month.
At the cost of nearly their entire force, they inflicted almost thirty thousand casualties before the island was lost in early 1945.
By that time, American heavy bombers were in range of the Japanese homeland.
Bombers hit Japan’s industrial facilities but suffered high casualties.
To spare bomber crews from dangerous daylight raids and to achieve maximum effect against Japanese morale, American bombers began night raids, dropping incendiary weapons that created massive firestorms consuming the wood-and-paper houses of the residential neighborhoods.
Over sixty Japanese cities were fire-bombed; one hundred thousand civilians in Tokyo died in a single attack in March 1945.
Okinawa was a viable base from which to launch a full invasion of the Japanese homeland and end the war.
Historians debate the many motivations that drove the Americans to use atomic weapons against Japan and many American officials criticized the decision at the time.
Early in the war, fearing that German scientists might develop an atomic bomb, the German-Hungarian-American physicist Led Szilard had written a letter to Franklin Roosevelt which Albert Einstein signed, warning of a nuclear-armed Hitler.
After some debate, other American physicists acknowledged the possibility.
The United States government responded in 1942 with the Manhattan Project, a hugely expensive, ambitious program to create a single weapon capable of leveling an entire city.
Three years later, the Americans successfully exploded the world’s first nuclear device, Trinity, in New Mexico in July 1945 while Allied leaders were meeting in Potsdam.
Two more bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man, were quickly built and detonated over two Japanese cities in August.
On August 9, the second bomb, Fat Man, was scheduled to be dropped on the castle town of Kokura.
But the town was obscured by clouds, so the mission proceeded to the secondary target, Nagasaki, an important port city on the southern island, Kyushu, with a population of about a quarter-million people.
In addition to the American atom bomb attacks, on August 9th, Soviet forces invaded Manchuria and overthrew the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.
On August 10th, Japanese cabinet ministers agreed to the Allied terms for surrender.
Emperor Hirohito endorsed their decision on August 15 and announced the surrender of Japan.
On September 2, aboard the battleship USS Missouri, delegates from the Japanese government formally signed their surrender.
The war effort converted American factories to wartime production, restored America’s economy to full employment, armed the Allies and American forces, pulled America out of the Great Depression, and ushered in an era of unparalleled economic prosperity.
Roosevelt’s New Deal had ameliorated the worst of the Depression, but the economy was still limping its way forward.
When Europe fell into war, Americans were glad to sell the Allies arms and supplies.
The “sleeping giant” mobilized its unrivaled economic capacity to wage worldwide war.
Government agencies such as the War Production Board and the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion managed production for the war effort and economic output exploded.
An economy that had been unable to provide work for a quarter of the workforce less than a decade earlier now struggled to fill vacant positions.
Government spending during the four years of war doubled all federal spending in all of American history up to that point.
The federal budget deficit soared, but, just as Keynes had predicted, the government’s massive intervention annihilated unemployment and propelled growth.
The economy that came out of the war looked nothing like the one that had begun it.
Military production came at the expense of the civilian consumer economy.
Appliance and automobile manufacturers converted their plants to produce weapons and vehicles.
Every American received rationing cards and goods such as gasoline, coffee, meat, cheese, butter, processed food, firewood, and sugar ena — ; could not be _ purchased an aoardng povatonng eset ishout them, New hous World War Il. building was shut down and cities became overcrowded.
The _ Roosevelt administration urged citizens to save their earnings or buy war bonds to prevent inflation.
They not only funded much of the war effort, they helped tame inflation as well.
The federal government raised income taxes and boosted the top marginal tax rate to 94 percent.
President Roosevelt and his administration encouraged all ablebodied American men and women to help the war effort.
He considered the role of women in the war critical for American victory, and the public expected women to free men for active military service.
World War II brought unprecedented labor opportunities for American women.
Industrial labor, normally dominated by men, shifted to women for the duration of wartime mobilization.
And over a million administrative jobs at the local, state, and national levels were transferred from men to women for the duration of the war; often permanently.
For women who chose not to work in factories or government service, many volunteer opportunities presented themselves.
The American Red Cross, the largest charitable organization in the nation, encouraged women to volunteer with local city chapters.
Millions of women organized community social events for families, packed and shipped almost half a million tons of medical supplies, and prepared twenty-seven million care packages for American and other Allied prisoners of war.
Military service was another option for women who wanted to join the war effort.
Over 350,000 women served in several all-female units of the military branches.
The Army and Navy Nurse Corps Reserves, the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, the Navy’s Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, the Coast Guard’s SPARs (named for the Coast Guard motto, Semper Paratus, “Always Ready”), and Marine Corps units gave women the A recruiting poster of the SPARS during World War II opportunity to serve as either commissioned officers or enlisted members at military bases at home and abroad.
The Nurse Corps Reserves commissioned 105,000 army and navy nurses recruited by the American Red Cross.
Military nurses worked at base hospitals, mobile medical units, and onboard hospital ships.
However, despite all the wartime and postwar celebration of Rosie the Riveter, when the war ended men returned home and most women lost their jobs.
Many former military women faced difficulty obtaining veteran’s benefits during their transition to civilian life.
The nation that called for assistance to millions of women during the four-year crisis seemed unprepared to accommodate their postwar needs and demands.
But many women who had answered the call refused to step back into the shadows and pushed forward, igniting a struggle that eventually became the Women’s Movement.
In this “crisis of democracy,’ Randolph said, defense industries refused to hire African Americans and the armed forces remained segregated.
In exchange for Randolph calling off the march, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, banning racial and A Phillip Randolph in 1942. religious discrimination in defense industries and establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee to monitor defense industry hiring practices.
While the armed forces remained segregated throughout the war, the order showed that the federal government could stand against discrimination.
The black workforce in defense industries rose from 3 percent in 1942 to 9 percent in 1945.
Most blacks served in segregated, noncombat units led by white officers.
The number of black officers increased from five in 1940 to over seven thousand in 1945.
And all-black fighter and bomber squadrons, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, completed more than 1,500 missions and earned several hundred merits and medals.
Black pilots of the 3832nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P-47 Thunderbolts red and many bomber crews specifically requested the “Red Tail Angels” as escorts.
Near the end of the war, the army and navy began integrating some of their units and facilities, before the United States government finally ordered the full integration of its armed forces in 1948.
Many black Americans saw the war as an opportunity not only to serve their country but to improve it.
The Pittsburgh Courier, a leading black newspaper, spearheaded the “Double V” campaign.
To achieve double victory and “real democracy,’ the Courier encouraged its readers to enlist in the armed forces or volunteer on the home front, and fight against racial segregation and discrimination.
During the war, membership in the NAACP jumped tenfold, from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand.
The Congress of Racial Equality, formed in 1942, proposed nonviolent direct action to achieve desegregation.
Between 1940 and 1950, 1. million southern blacks also demonstrated their opposition to racism and violence by migrating out of the Jim Crow South to the North.
Racial tensions erupted in 1943 in a series of riots in cities such as Mobile, Beaumont, and Harlem.
The bloodiest race riot occurred in Detroit and resulted in the death of twenty-five blacks and nine whites.
Still, the war ignited in African Americans an urgency for equality that they would carry with them into the subsequent years.
Many Americans had to navigate American prejudice, and America’s entry into the war left foreign nationals from the enemy nations in a precarious position.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation targeted many on suspicions of disloyalty for detainment, hearings, and internment under the Alien Enemy Act.
Those sentenced to internment were sent to government camps surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards.
Then, on February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of any persons from “exclusion zones” which ultimately covered nearly a third of the country at the discretion of military commanders.
Thirty thousand Japanese Americans fought for the United States in World War II, but wartime anti-Japanese sentiment built on longstanding prejudices.

This policy of mass exclusion and detention affected over 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-descended individuals.
Although the exclusion orders were found to have been constitutionally permissible based on claims of national security, they were later judged we even by the military and judicial leaders.
In 1988, President Reagan signed an Act that formall apologized _ for internment and provided reparations to SUrVIVINg internees.
But if actions taken during war would be regretted, so would inactions.
As the Allies pushed into Germany and Poland, they uncovered the full extent of Hitler’s genocidal policies.
The Allies discovered massive camp systems set up for the imprisonment, forced labor, and extermination of all those Untermenschen deemed _ racially, ideologically, or biologically “unfit” to live in a Nazi-ruled Europe.
As Russian and American troops liberated concentration and death camps, they discovered the Holocaust, the Nazi state’s systematic murder of eleven million civilians, including six million Jews.
But, like the Rape of Nanjing, the Holocaust was not a secret from those who chose to face facts.
Initially, American officials had expressed little official concern for Nazi persecutions.
As the first signs of trouble became clear in the late 1930s, the State Department and most United States embassies did little to aid European Jews.
Roosevelt pushed for the 1938 Evian Conference in France, where international leaders discussed the Jewish refugee problem and worked to expand Jewish immigration quotas.
But the conference came to nothing, and the United States turned away countless Jewish refugees who requested asylum in the United States.
Louis, carrying over nine hundred Jewish refugees, could not find a country that would take them.
Passengers were not granted visas under the United States quota system.
The ship cabled Roosevelt for special permission, but the president said nothing.
Even if Roosevelt wanted to do more, he decided the political price for increasing immigration quotas as too high.
After Kristallnacht, in 1939, Congress debated a bill to allow twenty thousand GermanJewish children into the United States.
First lady Eleanor Roosevelt endorsed the measure, but the president remained publicly silent.
It never came to a vote in the Senate because it was blocked by a North Carolina Democrat whose support Roosevelt needed on military spending bills.
The president, anxious to protect the New Deal and his rearmament programs, was unwilling to expend political capital to save foreign children that even leaders of his own party had little interest in protecting.
Military deaths were over 25 million, including 5 million prisoners of war who died in custody.
The war also killed about 55 million civilians, including 28 million who died of war-related disease and famine.
The Soviet Union lost 11,400,000 men in battle, 10 million civilians in_ war-related activities, and about 7 million through famine caused by the war, for a total of about 28 million.
At home and abroad, the United States wanted a postwar order that would guarantee global peace and domestic prosperity.
Although the alliance of convenience with Stalin’s Soviet Union would rapidly collapse, Americans nevertheless looked for the means to ensure postwar stability and economic security for returning veterans.
The inability of the League of Nations to stop German, Italian, and Japanese aggressions caused many to question whether any global organization could effectively ensure world peace.
Skeptics included Franklin Roosevelt, who, as Woodrow Wilson’s undersecretary of the navy, had witnessed the rejection of The League’s ideal of world governance by both the American people and the Senate.
But others, including Roosevelt’s secretary of state Cordell Hull and British prime minister Winston Churchill, convinced the president to push for a new global organization.
As the war ran its course, both Roosevelt and the American public came around to the idea of the United Nations.
Pollster George Gallup noted a “profound change” in American attitudes.
In 1987 only a third of Americans polled supported the idea of an international organization.
America’s entry into the war bolstered support, and by 1945, 81 percent of Americans favored the idea.
And Franklin Roosevelt had always supported the ideals enshrined in the United Nations charter.
Eleanor Roosevelt with the Universal Roosevelt signed the Atlantic Declaration of Human Rights, 1949.
Charter with Churchill, reinforcing those ideas and adding the right of selfdetermination and promising some sort of economic and political cooperation.
Roosevelt first used the term united nations to describe the Allied powers, not the subsequent postwar organization.
At Tehran in 1948, Roosevelt and Churchill convinced Stalin to send a Soviet delegation to a conference in August 1944, where they agreed on the basic structure of the new organization.
It would have a Security Council consisting of the original Four Policemen and France, that would consult on how best to keep the peace and when to deploy the military power of the assembled nations.
In a shift from the unarmed diplomacy of the League of Nations, the United Nations would have a military.
The plan was a hybrid between Roosevelt’s policemen idea and a global organization of equal representation.
There would also be a General Assembly made up of all nations, an International Court of Justice, and a council for economic and social matters.
The Soviets expressed concern over how the Security Council would work, but the powers agreed to meet again in San Francisco between April and June 1945 for further negotiations.
There, on June 26, 1945, fifty nations signed the United Nations charter.
Anticipating victory in World War II, American leaders not only planned the postwar global order, they planned for the returning servicemen.
American politicians and business leaders wanted to avoid another economic depression by gradually easing returning veterans back into the civilian economy.
Bill was a multibillion-dollar entitlement program that rewarded honorably-discharged veterans with a range of important benefits.
Bill offered a variety of incentives to slow their return to the civilian workforce as well as reward their service with public benefits.
The Veterans Administration paid educational expenses including tuition, fees, supplies, and even stipends for living expenses, sparking a boom in higher education.
Enrollments at accredited colleges, universities, technical, and professional schools spiked from 1. million in 1940 to 3. million in 1960.
The VA disbursed over $14 billon in educational aid in just over a decade.
Roughly 40 percent of Americans owned homes in 1945, but that figure climbed to 60 percent a decade after the close of the war.
Because the bill did away with down payment requirements, veterans could obtain home loans for as little as $1 down.
In addition, the V.A. helped nearly two hundred thousand veterans buy farms and offered thousands more guaranteed financing for small businesses.
It helped sustain the great postwar economic boom and established the hallmarks of American middle class life.
In many of Europe’s and the United States’ imperial possessions, the struggle for independence had begun long before World War Two, however.
And in imperial possessions like India, the “civilizing project” of empire for generations had including educating local administrators and training military and police forces.
The leaders of national liberation often came out of these experiences reasoning that since they were already experienced at running their own nations as administrators for the empires, it was time for the imperialists to leave.
Furthermore, the war was full of inspirational examples of Europeans and Asians who fought side by side against the fascist occupiers in their conquered nations.
The process was accelerated by the strain of war on the European imperialists.
France and the Netherlands had been conquered and themselves occupied as imperial subjects by the Germans, while the British were greatly weakened.
For instance, British leaders like Winston Churchill hoped and expected to expand their empire, which they now renamed a commonwealth, and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had no intention of giving back Iran’s Winston Churchill waving the Victory sign oil fields.
This may seem a to the crowd in Whitehall on the day he strange attitude for a nation voodoo eraionthltnewarw hat was having trouble feeding and housing its own population and leaned on United States aid like a crutch.
The timing of national liberation was complicated by the growing conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was both a competition to dominate territory and control alliances as well as an ideological struggle between capitalism and communism.
This conflict was known as the “Cold War,” since the two countries never directly attacked one another.
Instead they fought a series of proxy wars that occurred within the context of decolonization.
Each superpower competed to recruit more new nations to their side, pouring military and economic aid into the new developing countries.
In the Philippines, for example, the United States government handed over power to a local Filipino government within a year of ending the war with Japan.
The Americans fully appreciated the _ sacrifices made by the Filipinos under Japanese occupation and the contributions they had made to their own liberation.
LL ALWAYS President Harry Truman recognized the independence Propaganda poster depicting the Philippine of the Philippines on July 4, ene 1946.
In the days leading up to the announcement, the American and Filipino governments worked out arrangements allowing the United States to retain dozens of military bases and for American businesses to have preferential access to the raw materials and markets of the newly independent nation.
Sometimes, peaceful political pressure from organized movements also led to liberation.
Indian independence, examined below, is the first and prime example of how nonviolent protest, boycotts, and moral suasion could result in freedom.
However, there are also many cases in which independence could only be achieved through a more violent guerrilla struggle, as European imperialists were unwilling to let go of their colonies despite the desires of the colonized.
Indian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol, 1944.
When Britain called Indians to arms a second time, the Muslim League supported the British recruitment.
However, the Indian National Congress demanded independence before it would agree to help Britain again.
When the Congress began a “Quit India” campaign in August 1942, the British imprisoned tens of thousands of leaders for the war’s duration until June 1945.
Mohandas Gandhi was among those jailed; he was released in May 1944 due to health concerns.
British war strategy led to a major famine in Bengal in 1943 (modern-day Bangladesh, at the mouth of the Ganges River), and about 8 million people died of starvation.
Dead and dying about a half million Indian children on a Calcutta street published in Hindu refugees fo.
At the same time, the British decided to adopt a “scorched-earth” policy in southern Bengal, burning thousands of boats and destroying rice crops so they would not fall into the hands of the Japanese, who they assumed would soon extend their invasion.
Poor harvests and wartime inflation in late 1942-early 1943 sent internal rural refugees into Calcutta, the Bengali capital, exacerbating the crisis.
The British War Cabinet stalled in sending needed grain to the starving Bengalis—perhaps as policy, perhaps because of the strain on wartime shipping.
Very little sympathy was shown for the plight of the Bengalese by the leaders of Great Britain.
Churchill was not only aware of Gandhi, he was aware of the importance to India to the British war effort.
In addition to 2. million soldiers, the British government borrowed billions of pounds from India to finance the war.
And India was no longer merely a site of famines, it was becoming a source of essential supplies.
Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi in 1946 However, Indian independence was complicated by internal divisions, some exacerbated by the British themselves during many decades of imperial rule.
In particular, the British had encouraged division between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim populations; sending Hindu troops to police the Muslims, and vice versa.
Gandhi sought to eliminate the Hindu caste system which deprived the poorest Indians of hope.
While Gandhi simply wished for an independent, united India after the end of British rule, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League lobbied for the establishment of two states in the territory.
Jinnah proposed the creation of a Hindu India and an Islamic “Pure Land” called Pakistan.
Jinnah’s position was embraced by Hindu nationalists who wanted to be rid of the Muslim minority.
As independence was being negotiated after the war, escalating religious violence suggested that British withdrawal might result in a bloody civil war.
The new Muslim nation at the time included both the present territory of Pakistan in the west and the eastern region now called Bangladesh.
After independence in August 1947, the partition created a central Hindu nation with two borders into Muslim Pakistan India to the east and west.
These new, arbitrarily-drawn borders resulted in the displacement of 12 million people, as the former British subjects fled their homes to Four nations (India, Pakistan, Dominion of join the new nations that Ceylon, and Union of Burma) that gained matched their religions. independence in 1947 and 1948 Millions died during the chaos of the migration and the refugee crises that followed.
Gandhi himself was assassinated by one such extremist shortly after he achieved his dream of independence, in January 1948.
In 1947, a local Hindu prince convinced the British that the majority-Muslim region should stay with India.
The Government of Pakistan and many local Kashmiris continue to protest this, causing internal and external conflicts.
Since both India and Pakistan are now nuclear nations, the ongoing Kashmir dispute is a legacy of imperialism that may still endanger regional or even global peace.
Israel India was not the only region of the world from which Britain walked away soon after World War Two.
After World War I, Britain had been given a “mandate” to administer Palestine along with the oil-rich regions of Arabia and Iraq.
Between the wars the British continued to allow Zionists, advocates of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, to purchase land and move into the region.
Migration of Zionist Jews to the region had begun in the late nineteenth century.
This “second wave” of Zionist settlers included dedicated socialists who created cooperative farms called kibbutzim, and urban Europeans who built cities like Tel Aviv—one of the prime examples of the Bauhaus architectural style popular in Germany in the 1920s.
However, accelerating Zionist immigration increased tensions with the Palestinian Arabs who had lived in the region for centuries.
Competition for land and water, as well as for political dominance, resulted in violent riots between Arabs and Zionists in 1921, and a longer Arab revolt in Palestine from 1936 to 1939.
The British considered a petition to allow 100,000 refugee survivors of the Nazi camps to resettle in Palestine, but hesitated due to opposition from Palestinian Arabs and the nearby Arab states.
Zionist settlers had already formed a mutual defense force, the Haganah, in the 1920s.
After the war, the Haganah turned to sabotage against the British occupation and organizing illicit arms shipments.
More radical terrorist organizations also formed, including the Irgun, which in 1946 bombed the British headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people.
The Irgun also led a terror attack on the Palestinian town of Deir Hassin in 1948, in which over a hundred perished, including women and children.
Israeli government), the Deir Hassin massacre has served as a rallying cry and a justification for terror attacks against Israelis by different Palestinian-related terrorist groups ever since.
In 1947, the British relinquished their “mandate” over Palestine to the new United Nations, which tried to develop a new map for a Jewish homeland—the new state of Israel—while taking into account the presence of the Arab Palestinians.
The Zionists received more land than could be justified by their numbers at the time, as well as some of the more valuable agricultural and water resources.
As the British withdrew in May 1948, Israel declared its independence based on the United Nations borders, which the both the local Arabs and the neighboring Arab countries had rejected.
Israel’s new neighbors immediately declared war, but the new nation had powerful allies and was willing to fight for its survival.
The Israelis claimed they needed to have a wider defensive perimeter and that the Arab Palestinians had abandoned many of their towns anyway; which many had because they thought the Arabs would win a decisive victory.
A series of wars in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982 continued the conflict.
Israel expanding as Palestine shrinks, in an image produced by Palestinian activists.
The Arab world, considering Israel an arbitrary creation of western powers, refused to recognize Israel as a legitimate state.
Peace processes with individual Arab nations have brought agreements and diplomatic recognition from Egypt in 1979, to whom Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula, taken in the 1967 war; and Jordan in 1994, which relinquished its claim to the Palestinian West Bank of the Jordan River.
Weariness with war and terror, and a desire to qualify for United States military and economic aid, have led the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan to recognize Israel in 2020.
Reluctance to abandon colonies was especially a problem in Africa, where there were British settlers rather than administrators.
By the early twentieth century, 30,000 a | British settlers occupied all "" the best farmland in Kenya, Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta, 1966. which they had bought or had been assigned by the colonial government, leaving 5 million Kenyans without.
The settlers were people something like the Dane Isek Dinesen, who wrote of her experiences in Kenya in her 1937 book Out of Africa, although most were generally less respectful and interested in the natives than she.
Blundell despised the local Kikuyu tribes and believed the “Kukes” as he called them had only “come out of the trees” in the last 50 years, and probably as a result of contact with the whites.
The attitude of British farmers in Kenya was much like the relationship two centuries earlier between English colonists in North America and the Native Americans.
In Kenya, a resistance movement called Mau Mau began in 1952 when natives restricted to reservations in their own country revolted.
After World War II, 1.25 million Kikuyu had 2,000 square miles of marginal farmland to feed themselves while 380,000 British settlers had 12,000 square miles in the fertile hills of the Central and Rift Valleys, where they grew cash crops like coffee using native labor.
The Mau Mau uprising protested this injustice and the British colonial government responded.
The uprising lasted until 1963, partly because white settlers could not easily abandon their property and go back to Britain.
Power in Kenya eventually shifted from the British colonial government to a native government, initially made up of many members of the Kenyan African National Union that had led the resistance.
Its leader, Jomo Kenyatta, became Kenya’s first indigenous Prime Minister from 19638 to 1964 and was President of Kenya and led the KANU party until his death in 1978.
Kenyatta, like other leaders such as Gandhi and Ho Chi Minh, had travelled internationally.
Kenyatta was imprisoned from 1954 to 1961 for allegedly leading the rebellion, and became leader of the party and the nation when released.
Kenyatta initially tried to heal the nation by downplaying the atrocity of the recent war, and he welcomed the multinational corporations that dominated the Kenyan economy.
Kenyatta was often accused of being a socialist, but he was also hated by the British settlers for being married to a white woman.
Kenyatta was regarded by many Africans as a strong Pan-Africanist and was hailed as the Hero of the Kikuyu.
Although France had been conquered and occupied by Germany, after the war the French fully expected to regain their colonial possessions in Africa and Asia and resume where they had left off.
In Algeria, revolutionaries had been organizing to resist French imperialism since before the war.
On the morning of May 8, 1945, , a parade of about 5,000 Muslim Algerians celebrating the war’s end was met by armed French police.
Marchers and police exchanged gunfire and during the battle people on both sides were shot.
The National Liberation Front , encouraged by the fact France had just lost their colony of French Indochina, called on Muslims in Algeria to join in the struggle for independence.
The FLN applied guerrilla “hit and run” tactics as well as terrorism and torture of both French pieds noirs and Africans suspected of supporting the regime.
The French were equally brutal, and by 1956 there were more than 400,000 French troops in Algeria.
The French military lost 25,000 troops and about 3,000 European civilians were killed.
The United States recognized Algeria’s independence in September 1962 and the country became the 109th member of the United Nations in October.
Revolutionaries were led by Ho Chi Minh , who as a young man had worked as a kitchen helper on a steamship from Saigon to Marseille in 1911.
He visited the United States several times in his travels and later claimed to have met Black nationalist Marcus Garvey.
Ho began to write articles that were noticed in Moscow and he was invited to visit the Soviet Union.
When Chiang Kai-shek cracked down on communists in China, Ho returned to Moscow and then moved on to Thailand.
Ho was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931 but escaped and returned to Russia.
In 1988 Ho returned to China as an advisor to the Chinese Communist army.
In 1941 he returned to Vietnam to lead the independence movement there.
At the end of World War II, Ho wrote a declaration of independence for Vietnam based on the United States Declaration from 1776.
Ho repeatedly petitioned President Harry S Truman to recognize Vietnam, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded.
Meanwhile, British and Chinese troops occupied the country in support of France.
Vietnamese rioted and killed a hundred or so French citizens, and in retaliation French troops armed Japanese prisoners of war and massacred over 6,000 Vietnamese.
This was the same pattern of asymmetrical force used by empires against their subjects throughout the colonial period.
However, the story of Vietnam is only half over; we will return to it in the next chapter when we discuss the Cold War.
Kenya, Algeria, and Vietnam were not the only places where the imperial powers and their international allies responded violently to movements of national liberation among the colonized.
For example, the French killed 80,000 in Madagascar in 1947 when the people of that island supported independence.
The Indonesian War of Independence raged from the former Dutch East Indies declaration of independence in 1945 and The Netherlands’ recognition of their claims in 1949.
About 8,000 Dutch troops and their allies were killed, and about 100,000 Indonesians.
And growing fears of international communism pushed the United States government into supporting some of these actions.
Although the Americans had peacefully let go of the Philippines, the United States military helped Korean militias massacre about 60,000 members of a peasant insurgency.
The Korean Peninsula had been divided at the end of World War Two, like Germany, into Soviet and United States occupation zones.
Unsurprisingly, the two rivals backed communist and non-communist leaders in North and South Korea.
The resulting conflict, the Korean War , will be examined in more detail in the next chapter on the Cold War.
New Nations and Development The newly-founded countries in Africa and Asia all faced the challenges of establishing borders, forming new governments, building economic self-reliance, controlling natural resources, and working toward a more just and equitable society.
In previous chapters, we have seen how the new nations in Latin America had confronted similar issues since the early nineteenth century.
Other older but less-industrialized countries, like Iran, also addressed questions of development and national sovereignty.
One of the major challenges faced by these new nations was the problem of borders.
The administrative boundaries drawn by the European imperial powers did not always follow any logic that served the colonized peoples.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s division by the European powers had also haphazardly thrown together peoples who wanted separate nations.
Violent conflicts based on tribal loyalties have caused civil wars and __ political instability.
For instance, when the Igbo people tried to form a separate nation in Nigeria in 1965, the three-year civil war that followed killed thousands before Biafra was defeated.
The disputed region is petroleum-rich (Nigeria leads Africa in oil production); so that even today, Igbo French journalist Gilles Caron photographs the starving children of Biafra during the separatists harass the Nigerian Civil War, 1969.
Nigerian government. resentful that their oil wealth seems to benefit the rest of the country more than it serves them.
Although no tribe advocates establishing their own independent state in Kenya, conflicting tribal loyalties often spill over into political competition.
Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta tended to favor his Kikuyu people, who were a plurality but not a majority in Kenya, during his long presidency.
But it is one thing to write a constitution, and quite another to actually follow it.
Like the older republics in Latin America, many new nations suffered through periods of authoritarian rule.
Often, the military would step in and overthrow a democratically-elected government in times of perceived or actual economic or political chaos.
The colonial powers had trained militaries as well as educating local administrators; army officers often felt that they were in a better position to rule their countries than incompetent and corrupt politicians, even if they had been elected democratically.
Similar arguments had been made by fascists and authoritarians in interwar Europe; the mistakes of the imperialists were often repeated in their former colonies.
The Cold War complicated this situation, as fear of communist-led “wars of national liberation” frequently caused the United States and other Western “democracies” to support repressive military dictatorships.
India successfully embraced democracy and_ remains today the largest democracy by population.
Sikhs advocating for more power in Hindu India murdered Indira Gandhi in 1984 and ethnic Tamil separatists assassinated her son Rajiv in 1991.
On the other hand, Pakistan has been ruled by their military more often than not since independence.
Unlike in Nehru’s India, Pakistan did not benefit from an initial long premiership by its founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who died barely a year after independence of tuberculosis and lung cancer.
Internal and international crises led to repeated interventions by the Pakistani military into national government.
But even today the military plays an independent, often secretive role in Pakistan, especially in foreign policy.
All of the new nations were faced with the question of how to develop their economies.
Some governments were inspired by the apparent rapid industrial growth in the Soviet Union under Stalin’s Five-Year Plans, while others embraced the role of providing natural resources to the mature industrial economies of the West.
Independent economic self-reliance was often difficult to achieve when industries and public utilities remained foreign-owned.
Some new governments nationalized these businesses, so that the nation owned and operated them in the name of the people rather than for the profits of foreign shareholders.
In India, for example, Nehru’s government nationalized the railroads, electric utilities, and communication systems.
Seeing the results of India’s actions, many new African and Asian countries did the same.
Critics of nationalized industries argued that like the collectivized agriculture and industry of the Soviet Union, these businesses faced no competition.
The foreign businesses that had been pushed out supported this view, and a reaction to nationalization, privatization, began in the 1980s.
In India the push for privatization was led by Rajiv Gandhi, the grandson of the leader who had led nationalization efforts.
In privatization, government-run industries were sold back to the private sector, which on occasion included, once again, foreign investors.
Newly-privatized industries often initially embraced cost-cutting efficiencies and more competent management, repairing broken-down electrical grids and rail lines.
However, as profits were once again exported abroad or held by a tiny local elite, there has been a push back against privatization, as some leaders once again seek more benefits for the entire nation.
In recent decades, a leader in the political push for privatization has been the International Monetary Fund , first established at the July 1944 conference at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire mentioned earlier.
There were two architects of the meeting and the global financial plan that came from it.
John Maynard Keynes was the British economist who had pioneered the “demandside” economic theory that people like United States President Franklin Roosevelt had adopted to confront the Great Depression.
Keynes’ claim was that by spending money, the federal government could jump-start the economy, Harry Dexter White and John Maynard cheats jobs, and put the Keynes at Bretton Woods, 1944. money in people’s pockets that would enable them to buy consumer products.
This plan was temporarily derailed by war production and rationing, so it is unclear to many economists that Keynes was right and that deficit spending and government borrowing was the key to ending the Depression.
At the time of the Bretton Woods Conference, Keynes was the chief advisor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain.
The American, Harry Dexter White, worked closely with Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr.
White opposed the ICU and instead proposed an International Stabilization Fund that would help debtor nations maintain their balance of trade.
This grew into the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , which became the World Bank.
Another reason the United States rejected the ICU and the “bancor” was to protect the leading position of the dollar in the world economy.
Since the United States had the strongest economy in the world at the end of the World War II, they also dictated the trade provisions agreed to at the conference.
The major provisions of the agreement were a foreign exchange system with the United States Dollar as its base currency, along with a pledge by members to convert their currency to gold for _ trade-related demands.
This would prevent debtor nations from escaping their obligations to creditors by simply inflating their currencies.
Finally, all members had to pitch in to the new bank’s assets, although the United States put up most of the money.
Bretton Woods also drafted a set of trade-related recommendations and an International Trade Organization was proposed, with a goal of reducing tariffs.
The United States Senate, however, was not interested in ceding its authority over tariffs to a new international organization, and did not ratify the ITO’s charter.
The less aggressive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was adopted in its place.
The IMF was designed to oversee the international monetary and financial systems and to monitor member nations.
The United States undermined this mission when itwent off the gold standard in197l.
Inflationary government spending on both the war in Viet Nam and the War on Poverty begun by Lyndon Johnson, and a worsening balance of trade led the Nixon administration to fear that foreign holders of dollars would demand conversion to gold, which would rapidly wipe out the United States gold reserves, held in Federal Bullion Depositories such as Fort Knox.
The next largest national gold reserve, roughly 3. metric tons, belongs to Germany Losing their original reasons for existence, the IMF and World Bank were forced to adapt.
Rather than enforcing convertibility, the IMF began using its ability to loan interest-free development money to debtor nations as a way to intervene in and direct the economic policies of the borrowers.
The IMF's stated aim was to avoid or mitigate financial crises, using the “conditionality” of their loans.
The IMF now analyses nations’ economic policies and offers “advice” which must be taken in order to receive IMF loans.
The changes the IMF and the World Bank require are called Structural Adjustment Programs.
They typically include deregulation, privatization, and removal of trade barriers.
All of these measures have been criticized by debtor nations as being more beneficial for the lenders in developed industrialized nations rather than for borrowers in the developing world.
Other structural adjustments can include reducing trade deficits through currency devaluation, austerity programs to decrease budget deficits, eliminating social welfare programs, cutting public services, focusing economic output on _ resource extraction, and attracting foreign direct investment.
This current bundle of structural adjustment programs is known as the Washington Consensus and is associated with neoliberalism or market fundamentalism, which we will discuss in a later chapter.
Even in its more modest formulation, IMF policy is designed to liberalize trade, deregulate and privatize industries, and protect property rights above all other concerns.
The Green Revolution The explosive improvement of agricultural yields throughout the world known as the Green Revolution began in the 1960s in a research station on the edge of the Mexican desert.
The scientist most associated with these advances is Norman Borlaug, an agronomist who developed a disease-resistant strain or dwarf wheat that increased yields of the grain worldwide, especially in developing nations facing high population growth and threat of famine.
Borlaug’s education included a stint in the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.
He later remembered that seeing the effect of hunger on people in America “left scars” on him and motivated him to try to solve the problems of supplying food to a growing world population.
Borlaug continued at the U of M after graduation, eventually earning a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942.
After a couple of years with DuPont, he joined the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture.
Borlaug found that local Mexican farmers resisted planting wheat because a fungus called stem rust reduced their yields so much they couldn’t make a living.
A related problem with wheat farming in Mexico was that the plants grew too tall when heavily fertilized and then “lodged” or fell over prior to harvest.
Borlaug and his team bred a new strain of dwarf wheat that would not grow too tall when fertilized and that also resisted rust.
The process took ten years and over 6,000 cross-breeding experiments between different types of wheat.
The new wheat had the additional advantage of being able to be planted twice per year.
Although it took Borlaug a while to convince local farmers to try his new hybrid, they could see his fields and were finally convinced.
In the 1960s, as the program was becoming successful in Mexico, it was exported to India, which was facing famine.
American farmers shipped a fifth of their wheat production to India in 1966 and 1967.
Wheat yields increased from 12. million tons in 1965 to 20. million tons in 1970.
By 1974 India was self-sufficient in all cereal grains and the USAID (US Agency for International Development) began calling Borlaug’s work a Green Revolution.
Since the 1960s India’s food production has increased faster than population growth.
India’s improved crop yields, driven by Borlaug’s improved wheat, have made it a net exported of wheat.
India began exporting wheat regularly in the 1970s and since 1980 has exported wheat every year except three.
The nation’s exceptional agricultural turnaround was made possible by Borlaug’s new wheat, but also by extensive use of fertilizer, irrigation, and machinery.
This savings amounts to 18.6% of India’s land, or about the area of California.
Although the Green Revolution has undoubtedly saved lives and _ allowed populations in India _ to increase dramatically, Borlaug and the Green Revolution have been criticized for bringing capitaland energy-intensive western agricultural techniques to regions of the world that had once relied on subsistence farming.
Western-style farming tends to reward large-scale operators and often provides even greater rewards to manufacturers of Dr.
Widening social inequality and expanding farmer debt has led to issues like the suicide crisis of India, where hundreds of thousands of indebted farmers have killed themselves after becoming dependent on hybrid seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and the machinery needed to produce crops at the scale required by the new economics of agriculture.
Activists like Vandana Shiva have argued that 80% of the world’s population is actually fed by the produce of subsistence farmers rather than the industrialized agriculture highlighted in the Green Revolution.
If this is true, then maybe the claims of the “revolution” are overblown.
Shiva says this increased irrigation is unsustainable, and cites studies showing a rapidly sinking water table across much of India.
Shiva is also an important activist against Genetically Modified Organisms who appears regularly on stage giving speeches and TED talks, or on television as an anti-GMO spokesperson.
Although Borlaug’s dwarf wheat was not produced by the types of genetic manipulations currently used to produce GMO crops, some people still President George W Bush along with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi congratulate Borlaug during the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony on July 17, 2007. resent it as a human intrusion on nature’s processes.
Borlaug, for his part, has stubbornly refused to believe there is a rational argument against the “miracle” he helped bring about.
He received a Nobel Peace Prize, a Congressional Gold Medal, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Toward the end of his life he criticized people who questioned the Green Revolution as elitists who had never gone hungry, but he also admitted that although his contribution had helped save many lives, it had not created a Utopia.
A defining element of the Cold War was that it did not become a hot war.
Neither the United States not the U.S.S.R. launched attacks on the territories of the other.
Instead, the superpowers supported or intervened in the conflicts of nations in their spheres of influence.
To a great extent, the Cold War was a struggle by each superpower to extend its sphere of influence and block the other from doing the same.
The Soviets and the Americans justified their actions in a variety of ways.
Defending like-minded governments against a different political or economic philosophy.
One side said it was protecting the world from the threat of totalitarian communist imperialism and the other said it was protecting the world from imperialist capitalism.
This fact weighed heavily on the British and Americans, who were hoping for Soviet help in defeating Japan.
Stalin had signed a NonAgression Pact with the Japanese in 1941, which both sides maintained during the conflict; at Yalta, he pledged to declare war on Japan three months after the German surrender.
It would turn out that this would be the beginning of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, which would not be fought directly between the two superpowers, but rather through proxy wars in the developing world over most of the next five decades. ee x} World War II in Europe was ee S nearly over when Stalin, lan Roosevelt, and Churchill met at Yalta in February 1945, but the war in the Pacific was still unresolved.
Stalin had signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Japan in 1941 which both sides had maintained during the conflict.
Roosevelt and Churchill urged Stalin to join them in defeating Germany’s final Axis partner.
Stalin agreed to declare war on Japan three months after the German surrender.
In Occupation zone borders in Germany, and the four zones of Berlin, 1947. exchange, Roosevelt and Churchill essentially agreed to accept the Soviet military occupation of eastern Europe.
The Allies were interested in winning the Second World War, but were all aware that they were not natural allies in the long run.
Despite promised democratic elections, by 1949 the Soviets had set up one-party communist states mirroring their own in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.
Stalin also decided to retain the Polish territory first taken by his armies in 1939 when he had been Hitler’s ally and advocated pushing the borders of Poland farther west and south into what had been Germany in 1939.
And the Baltic states the Red Army had conquered in 1939-1940 while Hitler was attacking France also remained part of the Soviet Union.
The first Cold War challenge to postwar peace occurred in Greece, where communist and non-communist antiNazi partisans began fighting for control shortly after the Germans withdrew from their country in late 1944.
When the war ended, this conflict soon turned into a full-blown civil war.
The British and Americans began supporting the beleaguered parliamentary monarchy against the communists, who were defeated in 1947.
The conflict in Greece showcased the new “Truman Doctrine” of containment, under which the United States was willing to concede to _ Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, but would “contain” the spread _ of communist regimes in any other country.
Churchill said the situation in Europe felt as if Stalin had dropped an “iron curtain” separating East from West.
The German capital Berlin was also divided into quarters by the four former allies, even though it was surrounded by Soviet-occupied East Germany.
The division of Germany was completed when the western portion uniting in a federal republic, the Bundesrepublik Deutschland , in October 1949, complete with elections and multiple political parties.
At the same time, East Germany became the Deutsche Demokratische Republik , a one-party communist satellite state of the Soviet Union.
Although the United States and the Soviet Union had been allies in World War II, the relationship did not last long after the defeat of Germany and Japan.
In February 1946, less than a year after the end of the war, the head of the United States embassy in Moscow, George Kennan, sent a message that became known as the long telegram to the State Department The Iron Curtain in black, with a black dot representing West Berlin.
Warsaw Pact denouncing the Soviet Union. countries in red, NATO members in blue.

Kennan argued that Russian imperialism had not ended with the Russian empire and under the Soviets would advance under what he called the “new guise of international Marxism’, although the U.S.S.R. was being ruled not as a communist democracy but as a totalitarian dictatorship under Josef Stalin.
Marx’s ideal of a “dictatorship of the proletariat”, where workers would live together in such harmony that police and armies would be unnecessary, never arrived for the Russian people.
There could be no cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kennan wrote.
As the Russians had advanced toward Germany in the final years of World War I, they had not only retaken Russian territory but had held onto the lands Stalin had conquered when he was Hitler’s ally and expanded their control over Eastern Europe.
In the years after the war the U.S.S.R. controlled not only East Germany but newly formed People’s Republics of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania.
In the alarm caused by the creation of these satellite states, often ruled by Soviet-installed dictators, anti-Soviet sentiment seized the American government and soon the American people.
To try to prevent a drift toward socialism in nations struggling with food shortages and_ rebuilding } Wir al from the destruction of the war, the United States launched the Marshall Plan in 1948 to rebuild western Europe.
The United States was anxious to rebuild Europe as quickly as possible, no only to reopen markets for United States goods, but also to counter the influence of growing communist parties in Italy, France, and other Western European countries.
United States Secretary of State George C Marshall shipped food and other material aid, and provided financial support to any European country who requested it.
The result was the largely capitalist rebuilding of Western Europe and West Germany, while Eastern Europe began industrializing by following Soviet-inspired FiveYear Plans.
European nations entered new military alliances along East-West lines as well.
In April 1949, Great Britain, France, and other Western European Allies united with the United States and Canada in a military alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , pledging to defend one another in case of attack.
NATO became alarmingly relevant later that summer when the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb, breaking the United States monopoly on nuclear weapons.
In the ensuing decades, both superpowers would develop advanced missiles, air forces, and submarines to deliver an overwhelming nuclear attack on the other side’s homeland in case of war.
The superpowers adopted a policy of “mutually assured destruction” as a means of preventing a conflict which would almost certainly have destroyed most of the humans and probably much of life on the planet.
Israel developed weapons in secret in the 1960s, and South Africa developed a couple of weapons in the 1970s but scrapped them and joined the non-proliferation movement by 1991, at the same time the De Klerk government was freeing Nelson Mandela and beginning to end apartheid.
Also in 1991 Kazakhstan left the Soviet Union and inherited a nuclear arsenal larger than that of Britain and France, but became the first nation to scrap its nuclear arsenal.
Operation Castle series of United States tests of thermonuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands.
Stalin died in 1958 and after a power struggle in the Politburo a new Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, took power in Moscow.
Khrushchev distanced himself from what he called Stalin’s “cult of personality” and revealed the extent of Stalin’s atrocities against perceived political enemies, which had led to the deaths of millions in purges, forced labor, and famine in the previous decades.
Khrushchev wanted Soviet communism to provide a higher standard of living for workers.
Achieving this was difficult if the military budget was too large, so he sought to lessen tensions with the United States and its allies.
In 1956, democratic reforms in Hungary led to a_ possibility of spreading anti-Soviet dissent in neighboring communist countries under Moscow's control.
The Cold War in Asia Although the U.S.S.R. had helped end the Pacific War by invading Manchuria in August 1945, the subsequent reconstruction of Japan was strictly a United States affair.
By the time the military occupation ended in 1955, Japan had returned to rule by a democratically-elected parliamentary monarchy under the same Emperor, Hirohito.
The United States guaranteed Japan’s security through a Emperor Hirohito and General MacArthur, treaty and a military base in who led the occupation, at their first Okinawa, and _ provided 2 meeting at the United States Embassy, Tokyo, September, 1945 financial assistance and preferential access to US. markets to rebuild the Japanese economy.
This was partly an attempt to counter the perceived communist threat in Asia, and Japan developed a highly successful public-private economic model, ultimately producing electronics and automobiles that would dominate their sectors worldwide.
Mao’s armies were victorious over the corrupt and incompetent Nationalists led by Chiang KaiShek.
By the end, entire divisions of the Nationalist army were going over to the Communists, and Chiang fled to the island of Taiwan, which had been relinquished to China after pone a part of the Japanese Empire for fifty years.
Cold War politics was the reason for this diplomatic decision, but even after its end Taiwan’s autonomy from mainland China is still guaranteed by the United States As previously mentioned, war broke out on China’s border a year after the establishment of the People’s Republic.
The Korean Peninsula had been divided like Germany at the end of the war with the Soviets administering the north while the south was controlled by the United States.
The U.S.S.R. helped establish a communist regime under Kim Il-sung, while the Americans supported an authoritarian “nationalist”, Syngman Rhee.
In June 1950, Kim ordered the invasion of the south in an attempt to unite the peninsula.
As Kim’s forces quickly took most of the south, the United Nations Security Council ordered a military response, led by the United States.
The Soviet Union abstained instead of using its veto power in the Security Council, casting doubt on the western suspicion that Stalin had okayed Kim’s invasion of the south.
By October, U.S.-led United Nations forces had pushed the communist North Korean forces out of the south and had taken the northern capital, Pyongyang.
United Nations armies continued to advance northward toward the Chinese border at the Yalu River, which brought China into the war on the North Korean side.
On October 25, United Nations troops were surprised by a counterattack by millions of soldiers from China, as Mao defended Chinese territory from foreign invasion and his own new communist government, established only a year before.
United States commander Douglas MacArthur, a hero of the Pacific War in World War II and leader of the occupation of Japan, talked about his ambition to expand the conflict in Korea to a full-on war with China and contemplated using nuclear weapons.
When the general refused to back down and criticized the president’s judgment, Harry Truman fired MacArthur.
North Korea has become a totalitarian closed society, largely isolated after the fall of the Soviet Union and China’s embrace of capitalism in the 1980s.
The Kim family has remained in power despite famine and mismanagement, while defending their regime by developing nuclear weapons.
South Korea was ruled by Rhee and the military until a transition to democracy in the 1990s, when it became a successful industrial power following the Japanese development model.
The us continues to maintain a military presence in South Korea, and currently there are 28,500 troops stationed near the capital of Seoul.
The border between North and South is considered the most heavily militarized zone in the world.
The establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 led to continuing diplomatic conflict over the status of Taiwan and war on the Korean Peninsula.
An additional hotspot is Tibet, a Himalayan region historically dominated by the Chinese Empire that became an independent nation run by Buddhist monks during the chaotic early years of the Chinese Republic in the 1920s.
Mao Zedong decided to reclaim Tibet for his new People’s Republic, and sent in troops in 1951.
Internally, Mao’s own totalitarian style had disastrous consequences for the Chinese.
The communists had already begun land reform around 1946 in the parts of China they controlled, well before their final victory; the policy had gained them widespread support among the vast peasant population.
With the nationalists out of the way, Mao’s policy became more aggressive.
He called for the elimination of the landlord class of peasants and redistribution of the land more evenly.
Classmotivated mass killings of landlords continued for the next 30 years and estimates of the death tolls range from 14 million to 28 million.
Mao set up 25,000 “people’s communes” of 5,000 families each, which would’ be responsible for not only feeding themselves and their fellow Chinese citizens, but for providing surpluses to export.
The Backyard furnaces in China during the famine that resulted, known Great Leap Forward era produced very as the Great Chinese Famine poor steel and a lot of pollution. killed 55 million people, although a few million were apparently beaten to death and millions more committed suicide.
This disaster caused some prominent communist party members to question Mao’s leadership, but he maintained support in the army and blamed the famine on a lack of socialist commitment among the Chinese.
Mao initiated his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, leading the military to recruit young people to reinforce Maoist ideology and purge remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society.
Schools and universities were closed, and Red Guard troops were encouraged to harass and even murder intellectuals.
Educated people were beaten, terrorized, and banished to the countryside to be “reeducated” by the peasants.
The death toll of the cultural revolution is debated, but estimates range from 3 to 10 million.
It delayed Chinese industrialization and modernization, and a generation of Chinese were deprived of an education.
As seen in the last chapter, efforts by the Vietnamese to liberate themselves from the French after World War II were initially thwarted.
This changed in 1954 when Ho Chi Minh’s anti-colonial forces defeated the French in northern Vietnam at the battle of Dien Bien Phu.
Ignoring the example of the Korean War, the French left Vietnam divided between a communist north and a non-communist south; with the vague promise of an eventual referendum in the south to determine whether or not the country would be reunited.
The United States began sending military advisers to South Vietnam almost as soon as the French withdrew.
This theory posited that every country the “fell” to communism represented one more step world domination by America’s enemies, although after the “Sino-Soviet Split” of 1956, it was unclear which communist nation was the threat in Vietnam, then Laos, then Cambodia, Burma, India, etc.
The United States also sent military and economic aid to neighboring Laos, also newly independent from France, in an attempt to prop up a monarchy that was in conflict with Soviet-supported Pathet Lao guerrillas.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s the CIA and United States military advisors supported the South Vietnamese government.
By the 1960s, the issue of Vietnam would enormously affect domestic politics in the United States, especially after President Lyndon Johnson began sending hundreds of thousands of United States soldiers to defend South Vietnam in 1965.
In 1969 and 1970, Richard Nixon bombed and invaded Cambodia, but could not defeat the Viet Cong guerillas.
The United States finally withdrew in 1973, after 58,000 United States troops and over a million Vietnamese had been killed.
Without United States support, the government of the South lost the war and Vietnam was unified in 1975.
Cold War in the Middle East In the last chapter, we examined how the establishment of Israel in 1948 immediately led to a series of conflicts with its Arab neighbors.
The defeat of Arab forces by Israel in 1949 led to a surge of Arab nationalism, led by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser, who became head of state in 1954 after a military coup that ended the Egyptian monarchy.
Nasser’s popularity was cemented when he took control of the Suez Canal, surrounded by Egypt but administered by the British and French, in 1956.
Nasser became a hero for the Arab world, standing up to both the old colonial powers and what the Arabs saw as their creation, the new state of Israel.
Like Mustafa Kemal Atattrk in Turkey in the 1920s, Nasser established a secular state dedicated to improving the lives of ordinary people.
He largely separated religion and politics, supported government intervention in Nasser greeted by crowds in Alexandria the economy to prevent one day after his announcement of the foreign control, and provided British withdrawal and a failed assassination attempt against him, October 1954. more and _ better social services.
Nasser, a former army colonel, also relied on the military as the most reliable and disciplined institution to maintain unity and order.
The Egyptian leader skillfully took advantage of Cold War politics, playing the United States and the Soviet Union against each other in order to gain military and economic aid.
The Soviets in particular supported the construction of the massive Aswan Dam, completed in stages by 1970 to control the flooding of the Nile while providing hydroelectric power to Egypt.
Nasser preached pan-Arabism, the goal that all Arabs should be united in one federated nation.
Hatred and resentment for Israel was a powerful unifying factor in the region.
Arab resistance and Cold War considerations led the United States to continue its support of Israel, which was supported by Jewish Americans, but also by Christian fundamentalist evangelicals, many of whom consider the reestablishment of the Israel as the beginning of the apocalyptical End Times and the return of the Messiah.
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union sought allies in the Middle East, which was much closer to its borders than to America.
Russia still maintains its only naval base on the Mediterranean in Syria, dating from the time it began supporting the Ba’athi Assad family in that country in the late 1970s.
Nasser mediating an agreement between Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King Hussein, during the emergency Arab League summit, September 1970.
Textbooks often describe the Islamic resurgence that began in the 1970s, but usually consider this only as a religious movement.
Some critics of Islam claim the Muslim world has never recovered from the First Crusade, when Christian armies captured Jerusalem in 1099 CE and over the course of a few days murdered almost the entire Muslim population of the city.
And if globalization, which we will cover in more detail in the next chapter, is primarily an economic development that has overtaken world politics, then resistance to globalization should be considered in economic and political terms.
The places Muslims and Christians most often find themselves in conflict are often where western Europeans and Americans have been very active in extracting natural resources from territories occupied by Muslims.
Western oil companies in the Persian Gulf, for example, have had a decisive role in the relationships between the governments of Britain and Prime Minister Mosaddegh with United States the United States and the people and President Truman in 1951 governments of the region.
For example, when the Iranian Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, decided to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company , Winston Churchill convinced Harry S Truman that Mosaddegh had to go.
Britain’s MI-6 and the CIA organized a coup against the elected government of Iran and installed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as ruler of Iran in 1958 to insure a steady flow of oil out of Iran.
Oil production in Iran rose quickly from less than a million barrels per day in the 1950s to 6 million barrels daily in the mid-1970s.
However, the oil boom of the 1970s widened the gap between the rich and poor in Iran.
The Shah began a policy of embracing western culture and westernizing Iran; conservative Muslims objected.
The new consumer goods and cultural changes were generally available only to the richest Iranians, and were not accompanied by political liberalization.
The Shah’s secret police force, SAVAK, terrorized the population and routinely assassinated the Shah’s critics.
In 1977, SAVAK killed several Islamic leaders including Mostafa Khomeini, son of the ayatollah.
When the Muslim clergy announced an open-air prayer meeting on the annual holiday marking the end of Ramadan, the Shah panicked and declared martial law.,000 protesters took to the streets of Tehran.
The ayatollah Khomeini claimed 4,000 people had been killed and workers at Tehran’s oil refineries and government workers declared a general strike that brought the economy to a standstill.
By early December, more than 10% of the Iranian people were marching in anti-Shah demonstrations.
A group of Islamist students stormed the American Embassy in ‘Tehran’ in November 1979 and took the staff as hostages.
The ayatollah, who was an astute politician as well asa Iranian students storming the United States Embassy hae in Tehran, November 1979. religious leader, supported keeping the hostages on purely political grounds.
However, the new Iranian regime also confronted resistance from the Arab world, especially from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
Not only were the Iranians Persian, rather than Arab, most were also followers of Shia Islam, rather than the more common Sunni branch which is prevalent in the Arab world and among all Muslims.
Although Shiites and Sunnis had lived in peace for centuries, Iran’s new clerical state was deemed a threat by its Arab neighbors, especially by the conservative Sunni regime in Saudi Arabia.
Hussein, meanwhile, was a Ba/athist, promoting — Arab nationalism in a secular state ruled by his military.
In September 1980 he sent his armies into Iran in an attempt to take advantage of what they supposed would be political chaos.
Hussein claimed that he was poe Arabs living in the Iranian order region, although conveniently, these areas also had vast oil deposits.
The Iran-Iraq War lasted 8 years and, like the hostage crisis, helped consolidate the power of the Khomeini regime.
The US, USSR, France, and many Arab countries — provided support for Irag, which used chemical weapons against Iranian military and civilian targets.
The death toll has been estimated as 800,000 Iranians and up to 500,000 Iraqis.
Hussein had eae nothing in the war but debt and demands for autonomy by non-Arab ethnic Kurds in northern Iraq; he responded with chemical attacks on civilian Kurdish populations.
The United Nations, led by the United States pushed Hussein out of Kuwait.
Not even the Saudis wanted the Iraqi dictator to take the tiny kingdom, which despite its size had as much oil as Iraq.
Latin America and the Cold War The twentieth century began in Latin America with the Mexican Revolution, when Pancho Villa in northern Mexico and Emiliano Zapata in southern Mexico created an opportunity for new liberal forces led by Alvaro Obregon.
After defeatin Villa on the battlefield, Obregon hel a constitutional convention in 1917 which produced a document that embraced agrarian reform, an eighthour work day and the right to organize labor unions; and a declaration that the subsoil belongs to the state in the name of the people.
And in 1938, Cardenas nationalized Mexican oil, taking over leases given to United States and British oil companies.
The American president, Franklin Roosevelt, who had begun a “Good Neighbor Policy” toward Latin America when he took office, to emphasize trade and cooperation rather than military force, did not intervene when oil companies objected.
Britain acquiesced in order to assure Mexican support in what everyone understood would soon be the next world war.
Cardenas was part of a wave of populist heads of state in Latin America, charismatic leaders who tried to address the needs of “the people,” which by the 1980s and 1940s included rural peasants as well as the urban working class.
Latin American Populism also attracted a rising professional middle class, shut out of political power by traditional oligarchies.
Argentina was second only to the United States as an immigration choice for impoverished Europeans, particularly Italians, Germans, and Eastern European Jews.
The populists also supported nationalist economic measures, including pOlicies of import substitution industrialization, land reform, and efforts to reduce dependency on international markets for their mining or agricultural goods.
The crisis of the Great Depression emphasized the importance of building independent domestic economies and _ instituting education, housing, and infrastructure improvements for all of the people.
The global war against fascism inspired many to embrace democracy and overthrow long-standing military regimes, like in Guatemala, Venezuela, and Cuba; although these attempts at democratic practices were frequently short-lived.
Vargas was an opposition candidate who lost in a fraudulent election to an oligarchybacked candidate in 1930; a brief uprising made him president.
He skillfully faced down a separatist revolt in the wealthy coffee state of Sao Paulo, but after embracing a degree of liberal democracy, in 1987 Vargas established an authoritarian state in order to prevent communist-supported leftists being elected.
Brazil was the only nation in Latin America to send troops to fight alongside the Allies in Europe.
Vargas stepped down in 1945, but ran again for president in 1950 and was reelected.
Peron, on the other hand, was an army officer who had served as a military attache in Italy in the 1930s, witnessing up close the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.
Juan Peron, a key player in the coup, chose to become the Minister of Labor.
By guaranteeing labor law and favoring the workers in negotiations, he became popular among the urban masses in Buenos Aires.
Although the military regime grew nervous about his growing popularity and had Peron arrested, the workers came to his aid.
He could promise and deliver on higher wages, better living and working conditions, and vacations for workers as tax revenues rolled in because of high international prices for Argentine wheat and beef.
In the context of the Cold War, Peron proclaimed that he represented a “third way” between unfettered capitalism and totalitarian communism.
Peron claimed that his government improved the lives of Argentinians without having to take sides in the superpower conflict.
This made him particularly annoying to the United States, which often had to face Argentine opposition at regional conferences.
Peron bet on never-ending good times, especially when it seemed that the Korean War might lead to a World War III in which Argentina would benefit.
However, shortly after he was reelected in 1952, Peron’s popular wife, Eva Duarte, died of ovarian cancer at age 33.
Hundreds of thousands attended her funeral and a cult of “Santa Evita” quickly took hold.
A bitter fight with the Catholic Church led to Peron’s ouster by the military in 1955 and the suppression of the Peronist movement until Peron was invited back from exile to be reelected president in 1973.
Although the United States congratulated itself that it had replaced blatant military intervention and “dollar diplomacy” with a “Good Neighbor Policy” under Franklin Roosevelt, nations like Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras were still thoroughly dominated by the United Fruit Company ; still Banana Republics.
After World War II, the Dulles brothers became leaders in developing United States foreign policy in Latin America.
John Foster Dulles was a corporate lawyer who had helped negotiate huge land giveaways to UFC by the governments of Guatemala and Honduras.
His brother Allen Dulles was on UFC’s board of directors before he served as President Eisenhower’s CIA Director.
In 1954 the democratically-elected government of Guatemala began talking about seizing some of the vast tracts of land the United Fruit Company had acquired but was not using.
The government planned to buy back the land from UFC and redistribute it to the poor.
The Dulles brothers accused the Guatemalan government of having close ties with the Soviets and sent in the CIA to overthrow it in a military coup.
One of the key elements of Latin America’s relationship with the outside world seems to be the question of revolution and the threat nations like the United States claimed to fear, of socialist, anticapitalist movements in the Western Hemisphere.
In many cases the anti-capitalism expressed by Latin Americans was actually resistance to what they perceived as economic imperialism by nations like the U.S., which regularly defended American-based corporations that operated freely in their nations and often intervened in their politics.
Latin American nationalist leaders like Getulio Vargas in Brazil (President from 1930-45 and 1951-54), Juan Perdén in Argentina (President from 1946-55 and 1978-4), or Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico (President from 1934-40), who nationalized the Mexican oil industry, were not Marxists, or even particularly socialist in their orientation or policies.
Even when the government’s goal was something like land reform, they usually tried to compensate the former owners.
The conflict over land reform in Guatemala was misrepresented by the Dulles brothers.
The Guatemalan government offered UFC a price for the lands it took back based on the values claimed in the corporation’s tax filings.
It may have been an open secret that UFC was defrauding the Guatemalan government, but the government was well within its rights to call that bluff.
A truly communist government determined to eliminate capitalism in Guatemala might simply have claimed UFC had acquired the lands illegally and taken them with no offer of compensation.
Many idealists in Latin America and elsewhere were radicalized by the violence nations such as the United States approved or initiated to protect the interests of corporations but justified as aN} defenses of democracy.
An Guevara with Alberto Granado example of this was the in June 1952 on the Amazon River aboard experience Ernesto “Che” their wooden raft, which was a gift from ; the lepers whom they had treated during Guevara, who witnessed the their motorcycle journey.
Bolivia’s struggle began when the candidate of the Movimiento Nationalista Revolucionario)MMNR) won the presidential election of 1951 but was prevented by the military from taking office.
He served his first term from 1952 to 1956, and accepted United States financial aid in return for compensating the tin mines he nationalized.
Bolivians approved of his leadership and Estenssoro was re-elected in 1960, 1964, and 1985.
Peasants on the altiplano, the high Andean plateau around the city of Cochabamba, seeing the changes in the mining codes, began seizing haciendas and dividing the land up amongst themselves.
The government passed an Agrarian Reform Decree in 1958 to capture the campesinos’ support and control the process a bit.
Before the revolution, less than 1% of the richest landowners in Bolivia owned half of the country’s land and 6% owned 92% of Bolivia.
Under the reform, 185,000 peasant families, about half of all rural families, got titles to an average of about 20 hectares each.
National agricultural output fell by about 10% after the land distribution, but probably because people were growing and keeping more produce for home use and trading it informally rather than taking it to commercial or export markets.
Some cities saw food shortages, but these were offset by imports and some foreign aid.
After witnessing this revolutionary change in Bolivia, Guevara went to Guatemala and watched a similar attempt crushed by imperialist armies operating to protect corporate profits.
This experience and _ his romance with a Peruvian Marxist economist named Hilda Gadea Acosta, who he married in 1955, radicalized Che.
When he was placed on an enemies list by the new Guatemalan regime, Guevara escaped to Mexico where he che Guevara and Fidel Castro, 1961. met Raul and Fidel Castro, who were in exile there following a failed revolutionary coup in Cuba.
Guevara became an ally of the Castros in June 1955 and joined the revolution.
The survivors fled into the Sierra Maestra mountains and enlisted peasants into a guerilla army that harried the Cuban army for the next two years.
He is disposed to defend his privileges, but he is disposed to defend them only to the degree that they are important to him.
His salary and his pension are worth some suffering and some dangers, but they are never worth his life.
Occasionally, the heat level increased and the United States and U.S.S.R. barely avoided direct conflict.
The U.S.S.R. became a trading partner of Cuba after Marxist revolutionaries Fidel and Raul Castro and Che Guevara overthrew the Americanbacked Battista government in 1959 and replaced it with a revolutionary socialist state.
President Kennedy supported a CIA-sponsored plan to invade Cuba using anti-Castro Cubans in 1961, but the Bay of Pigs invasion was a fiasco.
Possible SAM site Nautical Miles al gee CIA map showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 1962.
The 18-day standoff ended with the Soviet Union withdrawing its missiles in return for American promises not to try again to overthrow Castro.
Che Guevara announced “Our revolution is endangering all American possessions in Latin America.
Guevara increasingly believed that the global north was guilty of oppressing the global south.
He even criticized the U.S.S.R. for not doing enough to end imperialism, accusing Russia of forgetting Marx.
Che supported the independence movements of indigenous peoples and left Cuba to try to encourage these revolutions, first in the Congo and then in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian government forces in 1967 and summarily executed.
Fidel Castro continued as Cuban president until 2008 when his brother Raul became President.
Development of Venezuela’s oil resources, thought to be at least a fifth of known global reserves, began in the 1910s when _ the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez relied country’s president granted on oil revenue to run programs for the concessions to his friends to poor, but failed to diversify his economy. explore, drill, and voting iil These concessions were quickly sold to foreign oil companies.
In 1941 a reform government gained power and passed the Hydrocarbons Law of 1943 under which the government would receive 50% of the profits of the oil industry.
The outbreak of World War II had increased demand for oil, and the Venezuelan government granted a series of new concessions that were snapped up in spite of the 50% tax.
The postwar explosion of automobile ownership in the United States continued to drive demand, and Venezuelan production increased.
Venezuela bought the Cities Service company and CITGO gas became a key export of Venezuela.
Oil was a mixed blessing for Venezuela, providing high levels of revenue to support government programs benefitting the people; but also preventing Venezuelan industry from diversifying.
However, the CITGO sign became a welcome sight for many New Englanders, as the company has donated millions of gallons of home heating oil to help hundreds of thousands of families in the Northeastern United States over several decades.
During the 1950s and 1960s colonialism mostly ended in Africa, although not without occasional atrocities such as the British oppression of the Kikuyu in Kenya in a conflict the British still lost, despite having overwhelming force on their side.
De Klerk, who became president in 1989, finally began to dismantle the apartheid system that had oppressed the black majority for generations.
Nelson Mandela was a member of a royal native family of the Xhosa people who became a lawyer in Johannesburg and became active in politics after the white government began instituting apartheid policies in the 1940s.
Apartheid was a system of racial segregation that completely separated the black majority from the white rulers and deprived them of political and civil rights.
Mandela became president of the African National Congress , an organization established in 1912 to defend the rights of native Africans and mixed-race people in South Africa.
Despite a commitment to non-violence, Mandela began leading acts of sabotage against government properties in 1961 and was convicted in 1962 and sentenced to life in prison.
In 1990, De Klerk called for a new Constitution and shut down South Africa’s nuclear weapons program.
Then he freed Mandela after 27 years as a political prisoner Frederik de Klerk and Nelson Mandela and lifted the ban on the ANC shake hands at the Annual Meeting of the operating as a political party.
After losing the presidential election to him in 1994, De Klerk served as one of Mandela’s Deputy Presidents from 1994-6.
Cold War in the United States Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy burst onto the American _ political scene during a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, in February 1950.
Since McCarthy had no actual list, the number quickly changed to fifty-seven, then eighty520 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford one.
McCarthyism was part of a widespread anticommunist propaganda campaign directed at Cold War America by the United States government.
Only two years after World War II, President ‘Truman issued Executive Order 9835, establishing loyalty reviews for federal employees.
The FBI conducted close examinations of all potential “security risks” among Foreign Service officers.
When the Korean War began, J Edgar Hoover, head of the Federal FBI Director J Edgar Hoover _ gureau of Investigation, 1961. unsuccessfully petitioned Truman to suspend habeus corpus and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty.
Hoover grew increasingly frustrated with what he saw as the President’s and Supreme Court’s obstruction of his ability to prosecute people for their political opinions.
The scope of Hoover’s suspicions and COINTELPRO’s targets grew to include civil rights groups, feminists, environmentalists, Native American activists, and anti-war protestors before the program’s dissolution in 1971.
The program’s domestic espionage and psychological warfare tactics were widely criticized.
In Congress, the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held over a hundred investigations and hearings on communist influence in American society between 1949 and 1954.
The Internal Security Act, passed by Congress in September 1950, required all “communist organizations” to register with the government, gave the government greater powers to investigate sedition, and made it possible to prevent suspected individuals from gaining or keeping their citizenship.
In the first year, the new law turned away over 50,000 immigrants from Germany and over 10,000 displaced Russians.
The CPUSA enjoyed most of its influence as labor organizers and as strong opponents of Jim Crow segregation.
But even at the height of the Depression, communism never attracted many American.
McCarthy’s and Hoover’s witchhunts hurled accusations and ruined careers less on people’s communist sentiments and more on their opposition to civil rights and anti-war protestors.
The arms race was not only about nuclear technology, but also a contest to improve the distance and accuracy of missiles which could carry a nuclear load.
The missile race indirectly led to the space race, as both the United States and the Soviets initiated programs for space exploration.
As Germany collapsed at the close of World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union had raced toward Berlin, hoping not only to be first to occupy the capital but to acquire elements of the Nazi V-2 missile program and jet propulsion project.
In the last months of the war, the Nazis had developed a “vengeance weapon” to terrorize England, even though Germany had no hope_ of winning.
Both the United States and the U.S.S.R. hoped to capture scientists, designs, and manufacturing equipment to build their own rockets.
Germanys top rocket _ scientist, Wernher von Braun, surrendered to United States troops and eventually became the leader of the American space program.
About 1,600 German scientists and engineers found their way into the American program.
The Soviet Union’s program was managed by Red Army colonel Sergei Korolev, although the Soviet program also had about 2,000 Germans.
Both engineering teams worked to adapt German rocket technology to create an intercontinental ballistic — missile that could carry the new nuclear weapons. ae technology eveloped even more rapidly.
By the time of the Korean War, jet fighters F-86s of the 4th Fighter-interceptor wing, su ported both Korean War.
They even used the ICBM launch vehicle in October 1957, to send Sputnik, the world’s first human-made satellite, into orbit.
It was a decisive technological victory, and the Soviet F propaganda ministry took full advantage of the opportunity to begin a space race while at the same time warning the United States that it could deliver nuclear weapons to American targets.
In response, the US. government rushed to perfect The Apollo 11 Saturn V rocket lifts off, July its own ICBM technology and in 1958 established the 16, 1969.
Initial American attempts to launch a satellite into orbit suffered spectacular failures, heightening fears of Soviet domination in space.
While the American space program struggled, the Soviet Union’s Luna 2 capsule became the first human-made object to touch the moon in September 1959.
American astronaut Alan Shepard accomplished a suborbital flight in the Freedom 7 capsule on May 5.
The United States had been embarrassed, and John Kennedy used America’s frustration over early losses in the “space race” to bolster funding for a manned moon landing, which succeeded on July 20, 1969.
Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet system collapsed and Russia lost control of its Eastern European satellites.
Soviet leaders Yuri Andropov and Mikhail Gorbachev began relaxing the strict controls the state had been exercising on satellite states.
Andropov prevented the U.S.S.R. from invading Poland in 1981 to crush the Solidarity movement, as they had done during the Prague Spring in 1968.
The freedom of speech Gorbachev granted included freedom to criticize the government, which he would be unable to control.
Erich Honecker had been instrumental in building the Berlin Wall in 1961.
Honecker had then ruled the communist nation from 1971 until 1989, and had ordered East German troops to fire on people trying to escape to West Berlin.
He fled first to Russia and then to Chile to evade prosecution over giving the order to fire on people fleeing from East Germany, but by this time he was suffering from advanced liver cancer.
Germany didn’t fight too hard to extradite Honecker and he died in 1994 in Santiago.
Tearing down the wall and_ reunifying Germany in 1990 were milestones in the end of the Germans stand on top of the Wall in front Cold War.
In 1991, Gorbachev sisanderbuecacintsletdos agreed to allow the Baltic Republics (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) to secede from the U.S.S.R., and hard-liners in the Kremlin tried to overthrow him in a coup.
The president of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, supported Gorbachev and thwarted the coup.
In late 1991, Yeltsin flew the Russian flag over the Kremlin alongside the Soviet flag.
The following day, the U.S.S.R. was dissolved and Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev’s office at the Kremlin.
The collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world’s only superpower.
We'll look at how these people consolidated their power in the new Russia when we discuss Globalization in the next chapter.
At its most basic, globalization refers to business activities and the actions of governments beginning to be conducted on a worldwide scale.
As we’ve seen, this has been happening throughout the modern period we've been covering, if not before.
The voyages of Zheng He, the European colonial project in the Americas, the Atlantic Slave Trade, and the activities of the British East India Company in India and China were all conducted at a worldwide scale, and all had commercial elements.
Conflicts such as the Seven Years War, the War of 1812, and World Wars I and II have also involved multiple continents.
Twentieth-century economic colonialism involving oil was not limited to the Persian Gulf.
As we have seen, before Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia became leading producers, Mexico was a heavy supplier of oil to the United States in the 1920s.
In 1988, Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas invoked the new, 1917 Mexican Constitution to nationalize all oil production in Mexico.
The constitution, which had been written during the Mexican Revolution, stated that the nation owned all the subsoil assets of Mexico, and Cardenas formed the government-owned oil company PEMEX to extract and refine Mexican petroleum resources.
Although the corporations (particularly Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil) objected loudly, Franklin Roosevelt’s administration, which was busy implementing the New Deal at home to ease the impact of the Great Depression on the American people, acknowledged the right of the Mexican people to control their own resources.
Soon, the advent of World War II encouraged the Allied nations to put anti-fascist solidarity before the losses of a couple of United States corporations.
In 1941 a reform government gained power which quickly passed the Hydrocarbons Law of 1943 which allowed the government to claim 50% of the profits of the oil industry.
The outbreak of World War II increased demand for oil to such an extent that the government was able to grant several new concessions in spite of the 50% tax.
The postwar explosion of automobile ownership in the United States continued to drive demand and push oil prices higher, and Venezuelan production increased.
Oil was a mixed blessing for Venezuela, providing high levels of revenue for the government but also preventing Venezuelan industry from diversifying.
In recent decades, Venezuela used its oil revenue to pay for a wide range of social welfare programs for its people.
The USS. criticized these policies as socialist, but they were rarely done without widespread popular support in Venezuela.
Hugo Chavez, who was president from 1998 to his death in 2018, criticized the United States government vehemently but also continued the Venezuelan policy of giving free heating oil to hundreds of thousands of poor people in the United States and Europe.
After increasing during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s and then peaking during Russia’s invasion of Afghanistan in the early 1980s, oil prices languished in the late 80s, exacerbating the Soviet Union’s economic problems.
In the early 1990s after the Soviet breakup, Russia began exporting millions of barrels daily into the world market.
The dissolution of the U.S.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact accelerated the globalization of commerce.
Globalization in this new phase is characterized by increased foreign investment by transnational corporations, privatization of state enterprises, free movement of capital across national borders, and a reduction of tariffs that impede the movement of products.
A wave of deregulation accompanied these changes, as nations competed to attract businesses that were suddenly free to locate themselves anywhere resources, labor, and environmental costs were lowest.
This free movement of capital across national borders was heralded by western pundits as the final, decisive victory of the free market over socialism and communist totalitarianism.
In Russia, people who had been President Boris Yeltsin handing the members of the political elite Presidential Emblem to Vladimir Putin. were suddenly in position to buy up state-owned assets the government was selling at fire-sale prices.
These opportunities were especially lucrative during Vladimir Putin’s administration, which began in 1999 when Putin became Prime Minister while Yeltsin was still president.
Putin’s friends and allies did extremely well in the sell-off of Soviet state industries.
With the spike in oil prices in the early 2000s these men made vast fortunes and became some of the billionaire oligarchs we now see running the Russian economy for their own benefit.
The change to capitalism in Russia did much less than it might have to benefit the general population because the oligarchs captured so much of the profit.
The man who captured the most profit seems to have been Vladimir Putin himself.
Putin’s net worth in 2018 was estimated around $200 billion, or about twice the wealth of Jeff Bezos and four times that of Bill Gates, the two men who then topped the Forbes list of the world’s richest people.
One of the important forces driving globalization has been the removal of protectionist trade policies around the world.
Over time, GATT reduced average tariff levels between member nations from 22% in 1947 to just 5% in 1999.
The World Trade Organization that followed GATT is a more permanent agreement that covers trade in services and _ intellectual property as well as physical products.
Although the WTO’s charter calls on it to “ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as _ possible” throughout the world, critics argue it favors rich nations over poor nations; especially in its binding arbitration processes that function like an international trade court, whose decisions take precedence over local or even national court judgments.
Global corporations that can deploy teams of lawyers (or even station them permanently in Geneva) to argue in their interest seem to have a disproportionate influence on WTO decisions.
Most of these rulings have benefitted the transnational corporations, often at the expense of workers, consumers, and the environment.
Transnational corporations are uniquely suited to take advantage of this new world economy.
The next five on the list are Saudi Aramco , Volkswagen, BP, Amazon, and Toyota.
Placement on this list is based on revenues, which is similar to the GDP used to measure the size of national economies.
Free trade and “laissez faire” capitalism are typically believed to be a “conservative” value, so some people have been surprised to see the recent Republican administration opposing agreements like NAFTA and TPP and the Democrats supporting them.
Globalist trade policies have often been called “neoliberal,” but this is another confusing term.
The elements that make this ideology “Neo” are in many ways the opposite of liberalism.
Since the Enlightenment in social and political thinking that preceded the American Revolution, “liberal” has referred to a focus on expanding the rights and liberties of regular people, often against the power of governments.
Today the liberties being protected by neoliberalism are often those of corporations, which in many cases have gained so much power over the lives of regular people that they are a more immediate threat than governments.
NAFTA was an example of neoliberal policy that increased the liberty of corporations at the expense of people.
Perot went on to explain that although in the long run and from a global perspective, globalization makes economic sense, it was not necessarily good for America.
He said,’when jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it’s leveled again.
Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.
Mexico has also become a large consumer of United States corn which receives extensive subsidies from the United States government.
Cheap American corn has impacted the ability of Mexican farmers to compete and has also impacted the biodiversity of maize, which you'll remember was originally developed in Mexico.
Indigenous varieties are threatened by the monoculture of U.S.-developed hybrids and since corn is wind-pollenated, the indigenous varieties are in actual danger of being lost.
A pest or disease that wiped out Monsanto’s GMO corn would be bad for the company, but it would become a global disaster if scientists had no other varieties they could use to produce a new, resistant hybrid.
The experts and pundits all agreed that NAFTA was not to blame, and for the most part, the press either ignored or misrepresented the Mexican financial crisis, which it nicknamed the Tequila Crisis.
Perhaps the greatest effect of NAFTA on Mexico has been the rise of Mexican factories called maquialadoras which were located just south of the border and made products for the United States market.
In the five years after NAFTA’s 1994 implementation, maquila employment nearly doubled.
These factories in border towns adjacent to the United States manufacture goods using supplies shipped to them duty-free, which they then ship back north.
By 2004, maquiladoras accounted for 54% of Mexico’s exports to the U.S., and United States exports had grown to 90% of Mexico’s total exports.
The advantages for United States manufacturers were lower wages than the United States (in 2015 the Mexican hourly wage averaged $0.55) and fewer environmental and worker-safety regulations.
As low as the pay is, after the Mexican recession of the 1990s these jobs sometimes pay better than other available work for poor Mexicans.
However, the gains in Mexican employment have been matched by losses in the United States As Perot had predicted, until wages for factory workers in Mexico rise substantially, workers in the United States will not be able to compete for these jobs.
Despite the United States recession in the early 2000s and competition from other even lower-wage areas like Asia, there are still over 3,000 maquiladoras along the US-Mexican border.
TPP was established in 2016 to create a common market for countries bordering the Pacific.
It sought to eliminate tariff and regulatory barriers to trade between most of the nations on the Pacific rim, to create a common market between Asia and the west coasts of North and South America.
TPP would also to establish an Investor-state dispute system that would allow global corporations to sue countries for practices they deem to be discriminatory.
Critics argue this raises the status of corporations to make them equal or even superior to sovereign nations, allowing them to sue in an “Investor Court” that would favor their interests over the rights of citizens passing laws to safeguard workers’ rights, the environment, or other local concerns that impact the global corporation’s profits.
This is another way neoliberal policies subvert the democratic institutions created by the original liberalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Ironically, NAFTA already includes an investor-state court system for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, but since most of the companies that would use this system are U.S.-based, it is not seen as being an issue for Americans.
TPP would be a much bigger source of lawsuits from transnational corporations not originally based in America and the U.S., which has higher minimum wages, worker safety standards, and environmental regulations, would probably be a target of many.
The support shown by “centrists” of both political parties in the U.S., and the opposition of populists on the left and right wings of both parties, suggests a growing sense among regular people that both parties are under the control of their political donors, and no longer governing for the people.
An important element of the shift away from a U.S.-centered globalization is the growing economic power of Asia.
Japan’s economy was jump-started after WWII by United States aid including a $2 billion direct investment and letting Japan off the hook for war reparations.
Japanese goods were also given preferential access to United States consumer markets, so the Japanese economy focused on low-wage industries producing products for export to America.
The United States no longer considered Japan a threat, but rather as a potential ally against communist China.
Other Asian nations like Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan followed in Japan’s footsteps in the 1960s and 70s, often also with aid from the United States designed to slow the spread of communism during the Cold War.
In addition to a plentiful supply of cheap labor, China had high savings rates and Deng’s devaluation of the nation’s currency allowed Chinese savings and foreign exchange surpluses to be invested in securities like American government bonds.
This made China the world’s bank, as nations like the United States fell deeper into debt.
Finally, a rising standard of living in China has created a new middle class and a huge consumer market.
In 2002, ninety percent of the Chinese population lived in poverty, with seven percent listed as middle class, two percent upper-middle class, and one percent considered affluent by world standards.
By 2012, the number of poor in China has been reduced to twenty-nine percent.
Two thirds of the poor (nearly a billion people) have improved standards of living, in one of the most momentous shifts in world history.
Fifty-four percent of Chinese in 2012 were considered middle class, and that fiftyfour percent is expected to rise to upper-middle class status by 2022, with another twenty-two percent moving from poverty into the middle class, leaving only sixteen percent of Chinese people in poverty.
China is becoming a dominant force in the world economy once again, and the increased spending power of the Chinese people will soon drive the global market.
Chinese demand for items like automobiles is expected to outpace the rest of the world for the foreseeable future.
Companies like Foxconn, which began as a contract manufacturer of low-tech items like computer cases, has become a nearly $5 billion manufacturer of the highest tech items like Apple iPhones and computers.
Lenovo, which began as a Hong Kong PC clone company in 1984, has been the world’s largest personal computer maker since 2018.
Lenovo acquired IBM’s PC division in 2005, and the famous IBM ThinkPad became a Chinese product.
Lenovo does about $45 billion in annual revenue and was the world’s largest cell-phone maker until 2016 when it was overtaken by Apple and Samsung.
As Chinese purchasing power increases, world industry is will be challenged with producing consumer goods without exhausting finite resources or destroying the environment.
Chinese cities have been known for their pollution, especially for their poor air quality.
An increasingly affluent population may become less willing to tolerate environmental destruction, which might be a positive change.
The European Union grew out of a 1957 trade agreement 1957 that expanded on GATT to form the European Economic Community including France, Belgium, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.
In 19938, the European Union was formed including the original EEC members as well as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
In 1999, 16 member nations adopted a single currency, the Euro, although Sweden and the UK retained the Krone and the Pound Sterling.
The English financial district called the City of London has always been a center of European banking and finance, and the British were desperate to protect Growth of the European Economic Community/European Union.
In the early 2000s several Eastern European nations joined, bringing membership up to 28 nations.
Most of these new members adopted the Euro as well, and after the global financial crisis of 2007-8, the Eurozone established emergency loan procedures that allowed richer members to bail out the economies of poorer members in exchange for what the lenders termed economic reforms.
Borrowers often viewed these reforms as a takeover of their economies and harsh austerity programs.
In June 2016 the United Kingdom held a referendum and in a shocking nationalist vote the majority decided to leave the European Union.
The Republic of Ireland will remain an EU member, which will complicate the situation on the border between Ireland and British Northern Ireland.
The economic impact on Britain is difficult to calculate, but EU nations seem disinclined to allow Britain to retain the favored trade status it currently enjoys.
And although many British people and politicians wished to reverse the decision to leave, the EU was unwilling to pretend the Brexit decision never happened.
During 2020, an eleven-month transition period was agreed upon, to allow negotiators to establish post-Brexit policies.
At the end of 2020, an agreement seems to have been reached that will allow the UK and the EU to continue trading without tariffs in 2021.
In addition to the increase in international trade, global culture has been permanently changed by communications technology.
Computer networks and cell phones continued a process begun with the printing press, the telegraph, radio, and television.
Each of these technologies has been used to spread ideas to wider audiences, often against the wishes of those in power.
More recent inventions like fax machines, data communication via modems, the internet, and most recently smart phones and social networks have been used to spread news of events like the Tiananmen Square protests, the Arab Spring, and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011.
In spite of the efforts of some nations like China and Saudi Arabia to censor media and limit internet access, it is increasingly difficult to firewall societies from the global media culture.
One of the first computer networks was the semi-automatic business research environment launched by IBM in 1960, which initially connected two mainframe systems and grew into an airline reservation system.
ARPANET, begun in 1969, was a network of networks, joining government facilities and research universities on a system dedicated to official communications.
Commercial and political communications, however, were strictly forbidden.
A computer scientist named Ted Nelson developed the basic ideas that became hypertext and the web between 1965 and 1972.
Nelson’s version of hypertext was based on the idea that there would be a “master” record of any document on the network.
Exact copies of that document (which Nelson called transclusions in his 1980 book, Literary Machines) would point back to the original.
Ideally, rather than just referring to the original, they would actually call up the original document wherever possible, eliminating the proliferation of copies.
This ideal was never really achieved, because even though storage was expensive, bandwidth was even scarcer.
This is unfortunate, because the existence of bi-directional links would have allowed the owner of a document to know where and when it was used, and to have received compensation for its use.
Twoway linkage was much more difficult to implement than a oneway hyperlink that launched the user to a new place on the web.
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared the two in a speech about Nelson in the 1990s, saying one-way linking was a cool hack, while two-way linking required computer science.
AOL free trial CDs became ubiquitous; CEO Steve Case claimed that at one point in the 90s half the CDs produced worldwide had an AOL logo.
The commercial nature of subscriptions like AOL stood in sharp contrast, for a while, to the early internet.
Mora uiteniobisseh Somebody jotted on the front page of the paper, “Vague but exciting”, and Tim was given time to work out the details on a NeXT computer in his lab.
Andreessen graduated, moved to California and met Jim Clark, who had recently left Silicon Graphics.
They formed Netscape and made their browser, called Navigator, available for free to non-commercial users.
Netscape Navigator was destroyed by Microsoft’s decision to bundle its own browser, Internet Explorer, with Windows 95.
Microsoft made it very difficult for PC manufacturers or even users to uninstall IE and use Netscape and Java, which led to an antitrust case in Feb 2001, in which the court ruled that Microsoft had abused its monopoly powers.
Netscape never recovered from losing the “first browser war” however, and was acquired by AOL in 1999.
It was a Windows app that provided a WSIWYG design interface and output usable HTML code.
Discontinued in 20038, Frontpage was not replaced by anything with similar power and ease of use.
In 1999, a new generation of the web called Web 2. was announced, which claimed to focus on participation by users rather than people simply viewing content passively.
One example of this participatory nature of the new web is the proliferation of social media.
The actual number of sites in active use is probably closer to 200,000.
People could create a profile page, post images and multimedia, and see what their friends were up to.
It was much less structured than what we’re used to today, allowing users a lot of flexibility to personalize their pages.
Myspace was overtaken by a service, Facebook, that provided even more ease of use and uniformity.
Facebook is extremely easy to use, which may be why it has recently become the place for grandparents to stalk millennials.
Questions for Discussion Most of the hardware and software you use was developed during your lifetime.
The final element in the story of computing and networks involves the battle between free, open resources and commerce, which we’ve already seen in the growth of the web.
In time, other organizations released versions which only ran on their hardware (and often cost thousands of dollars), including IBM , Microsoft , Sun Microsystems , SGI — all roprietary distributions with similar unctionality.
He wrote an operating system kernel in , C, which he planned on calling Freax.
The open-source operating system rapidly gained popularity among hackers due to its free distribution and its easy configurability.
A programmer could configure , the Linux kernel with just the features desired, which led to an explosion of both OS distributions as well as uses in embedded systems which were becoming popular.
And organizations like NASA discovered that clusters of networked off-the-shelf PCs running Linux could rival the computing power of proprietary supercomputers.
Companies like Sun and SGI found the markets for their workstations and servers disappearing overnight.
The #2 machine, which was the world’s fastest supercomputer from 2018 to 2016, uses Intel Xeon CPUs.
But in 2015, the United States government banned the sale of these processors to China.
The official reason for the ban was national security concerns, but many suspected a desire to recover the status as the world’s fastest computer for America may have been a strong motivation as well.
China responded by very rapidly shifting to using its own Sunway CPUs, based on a new architecture and instruction set completed in 2016.
As computing power enables increasingly complex artificial intelligence systems that can control financial trading systems, power grids, and scientific research, the challenges of national technology competitions become apparent.
Social media has been implicated in helping cause the genocide in Myanmar against the minority Rohinga population.
Russian meddling and manipulation of Facebook data by a company called Cambridge Analytica may have influenced the 2016 Brexit vote.
Foreign hacking and social media manipulation were both alleged during the 2016 and 2020 United States presidential election, although it’s unclear whether the intervention changed the outcome.
In the course of investigating charges of Russian interference, details have come to light of just how compromised social media sites like Facebook have become and how much of their users’ data they hold.
And in 2013 American whistleblower Edward Snowden released information to journalists showing that intelligence agencies such as the NSA and British GCHQ are systematically invading the privacy of citizens in a number of illegal ways.
As a result of these disclosures, Snowden has been forced to live in exile in Russia.
It is not clear, however, whether the practices have been discontinued.
Finally, even when there’s not an adversary regime like Russia spreading disinformation, Social Media algorithms create “filter bubbles” in which people only see information that doesn’t threaten their world-views.
In an attempt to generate greater advertising revenues, social media platforms and search engines routinely direct users to information that will attract and hold their attention for the longest time possible.
However, as a result, users are directed to information that conforms with their “profile” of beliefs and biases.
News and information are tailored either to conform to audiences’ beliefs and prejudices, or to outrage.
As time goes on, people on different sides of issues can literally find themselves living in different worlds, basing their beliefs on different data, and believing the other side is irrational and evil.
In the early days of the internet, communication was text-based because bandwidths were low.
The advent of fiber optic network backbones in the 1990s and the worldwide web created the opportunity to communicate using images and ultimately streaming video.G and 5G cellular networks allow media to be streamed to smartphones and tablets.
This rapidly expanding bandwidth created an opportunity for the internet to replace broadcast television just as it had replaced the analog, landline telephone network.
On the other hand, more content is produced for the web by global corporations daily, and the Federal Communications Commission has begun to eliminate net neutrality so corporations can buy “fast-lane” access that will turn the web into just another platform for corporate media.
The promise of the early internet was that even though corporations participated, it was basically a peerto-peer platform.
Eliminating net neutrality could potentially kill that, unless hackers can come up with a new disruptive technology that allows the people to stay ahead of the corporations.
Imagine if a group with deep pockets and a political agenda could start editing what you can see on the internet.
One of the most basic but often overlooked aspects of human interactions with the environment that has come to the attention of historians and more recently the public is the impact of population growth and resource scarcity.
There are a number of reasons society prefers to avoid thinking about the danger of having too many humans around.
And historically, the growth of our own particular group has been important for our survival and therefore has been desirable.
In the past, people haven't always been too concerned if the success of their particular community came at the expense of their neighbors.
Especially when societies face scarcity, attention focuses on how a shrinking or too-small pie is divided up.
Since the industrial revolution though, Westerners have been able to live outside of the constrictions of zero sum logic.
To a great extent, this Thomas Robert Malthus, one of the first abundance and sense that the popes toconcem sane pie was growing was based first on the increase in staple foods made available throughout the world by the Columbian Exchange and the Green Revolution, and also by the harnessing of fossil fuels such as coal and oil.
At the very beginning of the modern age, an English economist named Thomas Robert Malthus published a short book called An Essay on the Principle of Population.
Malthus’s theory, published in 1798, became instantly controversial on both sides of the Atlantic.
Thomas Jefferson sent a copy of the book to his favorite economist and asked for an opinion.
Another way of saying that is, population grows as long as there is food and water to support it, and when these resources run out, population is brought back down through famine, disease, and war.
By this logic it is easy to see that a society can easily outrun its ability to feed itself if the population is not kept down by reducing births or increasing deaths, and to understand why early modern Europeans were so obsessed with acquiring new territories to improve their food production abilities.
The famines, diseases, and wars of European history gave Malthus the examples he needed of the types of crises that tended to reduce populations.
If society was going to avoid these periodic disasters, he argued, then it would need to find some way of limiting the birthrate to avoid starving.
The Malthusian theory, as it is called, was intensely controversial right from the start.
Malthus himself only called for what he termed “moral restraint” to help reduce the birth rate, but many Malthusians had more active contraceptive measures in mind.
Over two centuries later, we have not left these arguments behind. ee Global deaths in conflicts since the year 1400 @ Each 00)] sents one conflict.
The other big controversy surrounding Malthusian thought was that it was used by some members of the British upper classes to argue that the conditions of the poor should not be improved.
If poor people had higher wages and more to eat, they argued, they would have more children and more of their children would survive, which would put unnecessary stress on the social system and in the long run lead to mass starvation.
Some critics accused these upper-class Malthusians of simply wanting to hoard more of everything for themselves.
But some of them sincerely believed that there just wasn’t enough to go around, and that adding more hungry mouths wasn’t good for the poor or the rich.
It turns out, however, that the assumption held by Malthus and those members of the British upper class (and by many people today) that feeding the poor would lead to a population explosion is actually untrue.
Population scientists today agree, after studying societies all over the world, that as economic security increases, a “demographic shift” occurs and birth rates decline.
Death rates of children decline and as a result parents needing to insure that someone will survive to take care of them in their old age have fewer children.
Educating women is the other major factor demographers have credited with reducing birthrates.
Both factors have contributed to a demographic shift in the developed world where family sizes have decreased from an average of six children per family in the early nineteenth century to 1. in the twentieth.
Many developed nations now face decreased growth or even shrinkage in their native populations.
Save the People or Save the Planet,” claiming that the issue is still very poorly understood.
Gates compared two nations, Afghanistan and Thailand, which currently have populations of similar size.
She pointed out that in Afghanistan, where 10% of children die before the age of five, population is expected to nearly double by 2050.
In Thailand, on the other hand, the number of children dying has decreased substantially.
As we have already seen, this has not been the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
New staple crops from the Americas, abundant land, fertilizers, and technology created a global Green Revolution that has allowed us to continually outrun Malthus for the last two centuries.
But an agricultural scientist named Karl Sprengel noticed in 1828 that plant growth was limited by the availability of the essential nutrient with the lowest concentration.
Sprengel’s contemporary, biologist Justus von Liebig, realized this idea had wider applications and popularized it as Liebig’s Law, which became a key idea in ecology.
The Law states that growth is dictated not by the total resources available, but by the scarcest resource, which he called the limiting factor.
Until very recently in human history, the Earth has been so big and the total human population relatively so small, that the resources available to us have often seemed infinite.
During this dramatic increase, there were periods like the early industrial revolution when worriers like Malthus and his followers expressed doubts and anxiety.
Malthus had no idea that his nation was about to expand its empire into Africa and Asia, or that emigration to the Americas and Australia would continue to reduce populations at home.
And of course he couldn’t anticipate advances in technology or the demographic effects of increasing economic security we have just considered.
But sometimes even these advances proved temporary or subject to disruption.
The population of Ireland boomed in the first decades of the nineteenth century, as potatoes increased the calories available to poor people and seemed to eliminate the threat of famine.
The Irish population peaked at over 8 million in 1841, based on the potato.
About a third of all Irish people ate no other solid food, and lived on a diet of milk and potatoes.
Worse, the entire nation grew just a single variety of potato, called the Irish Lumper.
As the science of ecology developed in the second half of the twentieth century and we began to distinguish between renewable and nonrenewable resources, and to worry about the dangers of depending on monoculture food supplies.
Malthusian anxiety has returned. (aaa Rae eK A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.
It began with the statement, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.
In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.
Ehrlich’s scenarios inspired some great dystopian science fiction, but luckily they did not happen in the way Ehrlich had predicted.
Actually, a couple hundred million people did die of hunger in the decades after The Population Bomb was published.
It’s hard to tell exactly because when the United Nations reported worldwide deaths in the 1970s and 80s, it specifically omitted deaths from hunger.
But these deaths did not reduce world population overall or result in the social chaos that Ehrlich had prophesied.
The Population Bomb may have done more harm than good in the long run, by making worry over the population issue an easy target for critics.
But people remained concerned about the rapid increase of the world’s human population.
In 1972 an international organization called The Club of Rome published a study titled The Limits to Growth.
In 2008, the original authors of The Limits to Growth returned to their models and published a 30-year review of how accurate their predictions had been.
They found that measurements of all the variables they had identified were tracking with the predictions the computer models had made for an “overshoot and collapse” scenario.
The accuracy of the predictions the study had made for the short term does not prove their longerterm predictions were accurate, of course.
Marion King Hubbert was an American geophysicist working for Shell Oil in 1956 when he presented a research paper to an oil industry trade group The American Petroleum Institute, where he showed that for any geographical area , petroleum production follows a predictable bell-shaped curve.
Although the data and especially its interpretation are very controversial, several credible sources suggest that the peak in world production happened between 2008 and 2004, right on Hubbert’s schedule.
These new additions do not refute the logic of Hubbert’s predictions, although they do potentially push back the timing of the supply crunch that we would expect to raise prices.
Two elements of The Limits to Growth‘’s computer mode, industrial production and food supplies, depend heavily on the price of energy, and a third is an issue for both fracking and tar sands processing.
A reduction of the supply of oil, an increase in its cost, or an increase in pollution could all have a significant negative impacts on those variables.
During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth, and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential growth culture.
These are not the words of some dewy-eyed environmentalist or crazy academic or sensationalist.
Some have argued that possible future discoveries of more oil could postpone society’s shift to a non-fossil fuel energy economy.
But even the oil industry for the most part agrees that production will decline.
Some climate activists have begun to suggest that for the sake of the environment, we ought to switch from fossil fuels to other energy sources as soon as possible and leave as much as possible of what is left in the ground.
The argument against burning the rest of the oil is that fossil fuels are one of the biggest contributors of atmospheric carbon _ that leads to global warming.
While this is true, other factors such as deforestation and even agribusiness release comparable amounts of carbon.
Simply stopping the use of oil will not solve the whole climate change problem, although it is a key element of the change society needs to make to stabilize the global climate.
Global energy corporations have an incredible ability to influence politics.
A few years ago BP (British Petroleum, established in 1908 as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and now operating in 72 countries) issued an “Energy Outlook” report for the year 2035.
BP claimed that Hubbert’s Peak Oil scenario was actually incorrect and announced the company’s intention to burn just as much as possible over the next two decades.
BP’s claim that oil production hasn’t peaked, however, depended on redefining the word oil to include both tar sands and biofuels such as ethanol.
Ethanol production depends not only on the energyintensive production of surplus corn and cane sugar (used in Brazil as the primary plant source), but in government subsidies that keep the prices of these commodities below their cost of production.
Although the idea that the planet’s climate has been adversely affected by human activity is very controversial in the media, politics, and popular culture, it is almost universally accepted by scientists.
Bahr 2 Middle East 8 anno O22 25-Oct-2020 by Thomas Schule, AGAL Capital GmbH Per capita carbon emissions by country.
Of course who they mean by “we” is unclear, and the penalties for heeding their warnings are really hard to specify.
We often hear that “The forecasts show that it is China, India, and the other emerging economies that are increasing their carbon dioxide emissions at a speed that will cause dangerous climate change.
This objection came from a European Union environment minster, speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 2007.
While it’s important for China and India to get their carbon emissions under control, it is unacceptable for Europe and America to try to shift the blame when we still outproduce them on a per capita basis.
Especially since most of the carbon now in the atmosphere was put there by us.
And to make matters worse, most Americans share a belief system that distrusts science and scientists, because science seems to contradict their most cherished religious doctrines about the nature of the world and their place in it.
To make matters even worse, concern over climate change has been identified with a particular political orientation, with people like former Vice President Al Gore seeming to suggest that if people aren't alarmed by climate change, they’re monsters who don’t love their children.
The claim that only liberals care about the environment is not only absurd, but it ignores the traditional meaning of the word conservative.
However, in addition to the negative reaction many people had to the tone of messages like the trailer above, the argument against recognizing climate change and doing something about it has also been carefully managed and funded by political action committees and foundations representing corporations that oppose changes in fossil fuel energy policy.
Less than half of Americans are aware that scientists are basically unanimous on this issue, and thinking that scientists are unsure affects their own opinions about climate change and the the government policies they are willing to support to mitigate it.
A recent study found that most of the public statements against climate change made from 2003 to 2010 could be traced to about 91 organizations which received $558,000,000 in funding during that period.
From 2008 to 2007 this money was easily traceable to sources such as ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, two corporations opposed to any changes in energy policy.
With the changes in foundation funding that followed the 2008 Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed corporations to hide their political spending, the sources of money paying for climate change denial have been more difficult to trace.
Climate deniers warn of the “command economies” they claim environmentalists wish to impose, using language designed to rile up libertarians and free market enthusiasts and mobilize them against changing the economy in ways that although they would be very bad for big oil companies, would almost certainly create millions of new jobs.
American think tanks have also recently begun funding publishing in foreign countries to spread their message.
While Germany is becoming a world leader in solar energy deployment, in spite of receiving only as much sunlight as Alaska, and while Britain is mapping its shift to a post-oil based economy with its “transition The Solar Settlement, a sustainable towns, many Americans aa Erojecs ibrar continue wasting their time arguing over the makebelieve issue of climate change denial.
Most economists agree that there are currently more jobs in the renewable energy sector than in the fossil fuel sector, and that trend is going to increase.
The overall economy would be better off, if we shifted to sustainable energy sources and reduced carbon emissions.
Of course, the global petroleum industry would be decimated, so they’re spending their money trying to slow the transition.
Of nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed climate articles published between 1991 and 2012, only 24 reject global warming.
There really isn’t any doubt that the Earth’s climate is changing in ways that are going to cause serious social disruption in the future.
When political leaders say there is still doubt about the need to address climate change, we should follow the money to discover why.
Our unwillingness or inability to understand the situation causes us to continue being manipulated by organizations interested in maintaining the status quo, and may mean that our choices in the future will be much more limited than they need to be.
Choosing a Chief Executive and Voting Three Branches of Government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial Since the late 18th century, many republics have separated governmental responsibilities into three branches, the legislative, executive and judicial.
The legislative branch (usually called a congress, parliament, or assembly), writes laws and appropriates funds for governmental departments and agencies.
Some legislative branches have two chambers—for instance, the United States has a Senate in which states have equal representation, and a House of Representatives, whose members are apportioned according to each state’s population.
The executive (a president or prime minister on the national level, or governor on a state level, or mayor on a city level) administers and enforces the laws passed by the executive branch, while generally conducting foreign policy.
They select members of their “cabinet,’ usually with the approval of the legislative branch, who are called secretaries of departments or ministers of ministries.
These individuals run the agencies created by the legislatures to address various social and economic aspects of society.
Local, state, and national executives enforce laws through the police and the operation of prisons, while national chief executives are often the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces.
The judicial branch is made up of the courts, who interpret the laws, determining whether or not a law has been broken.
The highest court decides whether or not particular laws are “constitutional,” following the foundational law of the country.
How Democracies Choose a Chief Executive Democratic countries choose the chief executive through either a_ presidential, parliamentary, or presidentialparliamentary system.
In addition to the executive powers described above, the president can also veto laws passed by the legislative branch, which then usually need a super-majority (like two-thirds of all members of each chamber), to pass the law “over” the presidential veto.
This system originated in its modern form in the United States Constitution.
Technically, in a presidential election, United States voters do not directly choose a presidential candidate, but instead vote for “electors” who are pledged to vote for a certain candidate.
The least-populated states have a minimum of three electors ; the most-populated state has 55; Minnesota and Wisconsin each have ten; and Iowa has seven.
Because of this system, it is mathematically possible for a candidate to win the popular vote and lose the electoral college vote—most recently, this happened in the 2000 and 2016 elections.
Because of this “divided government,” critics point out that it is difficult to legislate, while others claim that it is an important check on executive power.
Recent examples in the United States include most of the Clinton presidency, the last two years of George W Bush presidency, and most of the Obama administration.
In the last two years of the Trump administration, the House of Representatives had a Democratic majority while President Trump was a Republican as were most members of the Senate.
Another potential check on executive power in the presidential system is the process of impeachment, in which the legislature can decide to remove a president from office for criminal activity.
In most cases, the legislative branch has only one chamber instead of two.
The system originated in Great Britain and is common in many former British colonies (i.e.
Parliamentary systems sometimes include a monarch involved in the government, but usually as a figurehead who holds only symbolic power (i.e.
The Prime Minister is usually a member of the largest party, which means that legislation is more easily passed; it is impossible for the executive branch to be controlled by one party and the legislative branch controlled by another, as has occurred frequently in the United States Parliament has the right to vote against a prime minister, which may force a new election.
Sometimes the president plays a key role in multi-party democracies in which the president asks the head of a political party to form a government, usually in coalition with other parties.
A historical example we discussed earlier was Germany’s Weimar Republic.
When a parliament votes against a prime minister, the president may ask some other party to form a government instead of calling for new elections.
Voting Systems in Democracies There are several ways in which elections can be organized in democracies.
Winner-take-all In this system, the candidate with the most votes wins, meaning they can win with a plurality rather than a majority of votes.
It is common in most elections in the United States, especially in choosing members of Congress and in choosing presidential electors.
Winner-take-all usually results in a two-party system, as in the U.S., since voters feel that they are “wasting” their votes if they choose a third-party candidate.
This often results in people voting against candidates they don’t want rather than for candidates they do.
They reason that the candidate they actually prefer might take votes away from the “lesser-of-twoevils” candidate, resulting in a government that they really do not want.
Proportional Representation This system is only used in legislative elections.
In proportional representation, voters choose a party; parties are assigned their number of seats in a legislature based on the percentage of votes that the party wins.
In the fictional case described above, if the Republicans won 35% of the vote, the first 85 individuals on their list would win a seat in the legislature.
Combined with a parliamentary or a_ presidentialparliamentary system of government, a multi-party situation frequently means that a prime minister is chosen as part of a coalition of parties, if no party has a clear majority in the legislature.
Fifty Percent Plus One Candidates in this system must win at least a simple majority of votes ; if this does not happen, the top two vote-winners compete in a second election.
Ranked Choice Voting A variation of the “fifty percent plus one” system is called Instant Run-Off Voting , where voters rank their first choice, then their second choice, and then their third choice.
If no candidate receives more than 50% as a first choice, the next count is limited to the top two vote-getters, with the secondchoice votes cast by those whose first choice lost added to the top two vote-getters.
This system is currently being used in the Twin Cities in elections for city council and mayor.
Finance and Taxes Basics of Banking: Lending Money at Interest Banks earn a profit by lending money at interest; when borrowers pay back what they owe, they also pay the bank a percent above the amount lent.
Borrowers include both individuals who want to purchase homes and consumer goods, and businesses which are financing their operations or investing in their own expansion.
Also, in some countries , banks make investments in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments to earn higher rates of return.
The trick to remember, however, is that if there is a high supply and low demand of a currency—too much money in the money supply—the value of money drops, so prices actually go up.
Until the early 1970s, most national currencies were “backed” by gold ; in other words, its “worth” was denominated in metal.
As seen in the example of hyperinflation during the Weimar Republic in Chapter 8, too much money in the money supply may mean that wages chase prices, which in turn chase wages; causing an inflationary spiral with people losing their savings to buy basic food items.
However, defining what is “normal” inflation, and achieving that level, is the challenge faced by banking systems.
Inflation and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System was established in the United States in 1913 during the period of activist government known as the Progressive Era.
Other countries already had governmentrun central banks, and the United States had experimented with this idea in the 1820s and 1880s, but had abandoned it, relying exclusively on the private banking system.
Morgan stepped in, lent money to banks that were on the verge of collapse, and investors’ confidence in the financial system was restored.
After the panic, many people began thinking that maybe having the entire United States banking system dependent on a single private citizen was a bad idea, and that the United States should adopt the “central bank” concept from other countries.
Interest Rates, Banks, and Lending The Fed lends money to banks at interest, which then lend to each other and to the rest of the economy at a higher rate of interest.
The interest rate banks use to lend to each other is called the prime rate.
It is usually three percentage points above the Fed’s interest rate to the banks.
Banks make profits by lending money at interest—but they have to also pay back the Fed.
The banks that borrow from other banks establish a higher interest rate than the prime rate for loans to businesses and personal borrowers.
The bank’s rate may fluctuate for individual borrowers based on how much confidence a bank has that they will be paid back.
This decision is based on a “credit rating” which is established by private companies like Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s.
Banks also consider other factors, for both individuals and businesses, such as savings and other investments, before lending money.
If a bank or other lending institution has less confidence in a borrower, they will charge a higher interest rate.
The Fed’s Interest Rate and Monetary Policy As mentioned, the Federal Reserve plays an important role in determining interest rates.
It uses this power to establish a healthy rate of inflation or to help stimulate the economy.
If the Fed’s rate goes up, the prime rate goes up and banks, businesses, and consumers borrow less and buy less because borrowing gets too expensive.
However, high interest rates may also slow down the economy because businesses will invest less and consumers will not buy as much.
If the interest rate goes down, banks, businesses, and consumers borrow more and buy more.
The Fed’s Monetary Policy, 1979-Today In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when there was a recession with over 10% inflation and high unemployment, the Fed raised interest rates and the prime rate went up to control inflation.
At the time, banks actually competed with prizes and other incentives to attract depositors, including establishing high rates of interest on savings accounts.
People spent less and saved more, which also affected the money supply.
However, when the tech boom slowed down around 1999, the Fed lowered interest rates even more to stimulate the economy.
This policy led to increased borrowing to buy real estate, which indirectly led to the 2008 Financial Crisis.
Since 2008, the prime rate has been very low, sometimes barely above 0%, in order to stimulate economic growth.
In the U.S., the recovery was gradual but sustained—jobs were added to the economy for every month from mid-2009 until the beginning of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.
This means that the Fed buys bank debt—what banks borrow from the Fed or other banks—so that banks can lend money instead of using it to pay off their own debts.
No “Sovereign Funds” Unlike other central banks—for instance, those of China and Japan—the Fed does not make investments.
In the case of China and Japan and other countries, central banks maintain “sovereign funds” by buying investments in their own countries, or in others.
Taxes, Government Borrowing and the World Economy Taxes and Government Revenue Taxes pay for government services (military, police, prisons, education, infrastructure, Social Security, etc.), but there are several different kinds of taxes.
For instance in the United States, the United States federal government raises revenue by taxing—taking a percentage—of individual income and corporate earnings.
The federal government also raises revenue through some sales taxes, especially on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco.
Customs and tariffs are still around but are a lot less important than they were in the nineteenth century as a source of revenue.
Most, but not all, states also have taxes on personal income and corporate earnings.
Municipal governments in the United States usually collect property taxes to raise revenue.
Property taxes are based on the value of real estate held by an individual or corporation.
School taxes in the United States are also almost always property taxes, which explains why rich suburban school districts can provide better public schools than poor urban and rural districts.
Advocates of this perspective argue that government projects and services help build the country’s future (infrastructure, education, affordable housing, etc.) while providing jobs, especially during hard economic times.
Those who promote this theory believe that individuals and businesses should have more money to spend any way they wish.
Consumers will stimulate the market through personal spending, while businesses will reinvest and help grow the economy.
This will create more government revenue as new workers and growing businesses are paying taxes.
Selling Bonds Governments at every level and all over the world borrow money by selling bonds to finance spending on projects and services.
Bondholders are paid interest on bonds, but, like stocks, may also resell them to other investors.
Government bonds are paid with revenue gradually over years, spreading the debt to the next generations.
Others, particularly among Republicans, feel that the government should not burden future generations with more government debt.
Like determining the best rate of inflation, the proper prime rate for an economy, and the level of taxation, economists and politicians also debate about how much government debt is too much.
Confidence in Government Debt An important consideration for investors interested in buying government bonds is the confidence in a government’s ability to pay its debt.
Just like individuals and businesses, as long as a government continues to pay its debt completely and on time, then banks will lend more money to the government, adjusting the interest rate based on their level of confidence.
Even countries have credit scores from rating agencies to help lenders and investors make decisions.
However, unlike individuals, governments never completely pay off debt, but that is less important than their ability to borrow based on how well they keep up on payments.
For instance, Germany did not finish paying all reparations from World War One until 2010, yet this fact had little effect on its economy, which has consistently been among the world’s top three for decades.
If a nation’s economy collapses or some other disaster happens, or the debt gets too big (and again, there is a lot of debate over what “too big” is), then investors will have less confidence and a government will be unable to sell bonds and borrow money.
The debt payments are restructured by the lenders, or reneged upon entirely, with future borrowing greatly affected because of the lack of confidence by investors and lenders.
Sometimes a government built infrastructure that did not end up stimulating economic growth; other times, they did not foresee huge changes—like a population leaving a city for the suburbs.
And sometimes, especially in certain developing nations, corrupt politicians and administrators robbed the funds, saddling a government with debt but leaving nothing of value.
