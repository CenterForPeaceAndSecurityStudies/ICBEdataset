Democratic senator and civil rights activistROBERT F KENNEDY signed typewritten letter on his personal United States Senate letterhead stationery written to Mr Evan Thomas of Harper & Row Publishers.
The warmly written one page letter, dated July 28, 1966, contains excellent and poignant commentary on the death of his brother, President John F Kennedy.
I understand others have plans to publish books regarding the events of November 22, 1963.
As this is going to be the subject matter of a book and since Mr Manchester in his research had access to more information and sources than any other writer, members of the Kennedy family will place no obstacle in the way of publication of his work.
However, if Mr Manchester's account is published in segments or excerpts, I would expect that incidents would not be taken out of context or summarized in any way which might distort the facts of, or the events relating to President Kennedy's death.

An icon ofmodern American liberalismand a memberof theKennedyfamily, he was a younger brother of PresidentJohn F Kennedy, and heserved as the president's chief adviser during his presidency.
From 1961 to 1964 he served as theU.S.Attorney General.Following hisbrotherJohn's assassination, on November 22, 1963, Kennedy continuedto serve as the Attorney General under President Lyndon B Johnsonfornine months.
That nightKennedy wasshotbySirhan Sirhan, aPalestinianArab.Mortallywounded, he survived nearly 26 hours, then died early in the morning of June 6.
Bobby spent summers with his family at their home inHyannisPort, Massachusetts, and Christmas and Easter holidays with hisfamily at their winter home inPalmBeach, Florida, purchased in 1933.
He attended public elementaryschool in Riverdale from kindergarten through second grade; thenBronxville School, the public school inBronxville, from third through fifth grade, repeating the third grade;thenRiverdaleCountry School, a private school for boys in Riverdale, for sixthgrade.In March 1938,when he was 12, Bobby sailed with his mother and his four youngest siblings toEngland, where his father had begun serving as ambassador.
He attended theprivate Gibbs School for Boys in London for seventh grade, returning to the United States just before the outbreak of war in 1939.
Paul's School, an elite privatepreparatoryschool for boys inConcord,New Hampshire.However, hetransferred after two months at St.
Paul's toPortsmouthPriory School, aBenedictineboardingschool for boys inPortsmouth,Rhode Island, for eighth through tenth grades.In September1942, Kennedy transferred toMilton Academy, a thirdboarding school inMilton,Massachusetts, for eleventh and twelfth grades.Six weeks beforehis eighteenth birthday, Bobby enlisted in the United States Naval Reserveas anapprentice seaman,releasedfrom active duty until March 1944 when he left Milton Academy early to reportto theV-12 Navy College Training ProgramatHarvard Collegein Cambridge,Massachusetts.
Kennedy graduated from law school in June 1951 and flewwith Ethel to Greenwich to stay in his father-in-law's guest house.
Kennedy'sfirst child,Kathleen,was born on July 4, 1951,and Kennedyspent the summer studying for the Massachusettsbar exam.In September 1951,Kennedy went to San Francisco as a correspondent of theBoston Posttocover the convention concluding theTreatyof Peace with Japan.In October1951, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week Asian trip with his brother John and his sisterPatriciatoIsrael, India, Vietnam, and Japan.Because oftheir age gap, the two brothers had previously seen little of each other.
After aperiod as an assistant to his father on theHoover Commission, Kennedyrejoined the Senate committee staff as chief counsel for the Democraticminority in February 1954.
When theDemocrats gained the majority in January 1955, he became chief counsel.
Kennedywas a background figure in the televisedMcCarthyHearingsof 1954 into the conduct of McCarthy.Kennedy worked asan aide toAdlaiStevenson IIduring the1956 presidential electionto learn for afuture national campaign by John.
After performing well inthe Senate hearing he easily won confirmation in January 1961.
Kennedy chosewhat Schlesinger calls an ""outstanding"" group of deputy and assistantattorneys general, includingByron WhiteandNicholasKatzenbach.Hilty concludesthat Bobby ""played an unusual combination of rolesâ€”campaign director,attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser,and brother protector"" and that nobody before him had such power.His tenureas Attorney General was easily the period of greatest power for the office; noprevious United States Attorney General had enjoyed such clear influence on allareas of policy during an administration.
To a great extent, President Kennedysought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, resulting in RobertKennedy remaining the President's closest political adviser.
Kennedy was reliedupon as both the President's primary source of administrative information andas a general counsel with whom trust was implicit, given the familial ties ofthe two men.
Thepresident once remarked about his brother that, ""If I want something doneand done immediately I rely on the Attorney General.
As one ofPresident Kennedy's closest White House advisers, RFK played a crucial role inthe events surrounding theBerlinCrisis of 1961.
ThePresident came to share his brother's sense of urgency on the matters at handto such an extent that it was at the Attorney General's insistence that he madehis famous address to the nation.Bobby played alarge role in the Freedom Riders protests.
Kennedy acted after the Anniston busbombings to protect the Riders in continuing their journey.
Kennedy sent JohnSeigenthaler, his administrative assistant, to Alabama to attempt to secure theriders' safety there.
King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy for his commandingof the force dispatched to break up an attack that might otherwise have endedKing's life.Kennedy thennegotiated the safe passage of the Freedom Riders from the First Baptist Churchto Jackson Mississippi, where they were arrested.He offeredto bail the Freedom Riders out of jail, but they refused.
Kennedy had hoped that legal means, along with theescort of United States Marshals, would be enough to force GovernorRoss Barnettto allowthe school admission.
He also was very concerned there might be a""mini-civil war"" between the United States Army troops and armed protesters.PresidentJohn F Kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campusturned violent.Ensuingriotsduringthe period of Meredith's admittance resulted in hundreds of injuries and twodeaths.
Yet Kennedy remained adamant concerning the rights of black students toenjoy the benefits of all levels of the educational system.
Robert Kennedy sawvoting as the key to racial justice, and collaborated with Presidents Kennedyand Johnson to create the landmarkCivilRights Act of 1964, which helped bring an end toJim Crow laws.He was to maintainhis commitment to racial equality into his own presidential campaign, extendinghis firm sense of social justice to all areas of national life and into mattersof foreign and economic policy.
It has beenargued that although this speech has been largely overlooked and ignored,because of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., it was one of mostpowerful and heartfelt speeches Kennedy delivered.After theassassination of his brother Jack, Robert Kennedy undertook a 1966 tour ofSouth Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti-apartheidmovement.The tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politiciansdared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa.
Kennedy spoke outagainst the oppression of the native population and was welcomed by the blackpopulation as though a visiting head of state.
In an interview withLookMagazinehe had this to say:In South Africa, agroup of foreign press representatives chartered an aircraft, after theNational Union of South African Studentsfailedto make sufficient travel arrangements.
He also helped develop the strategy to blockadeCuba during theCubanMissile Crisisinstead of initiating a military strike thatmight have led to nuclear war.
Kennedy had initially been among the morehawkish elements of the administration on matters concerning Cuban insurrectionaryaid.
His initial strong support for covert actions in Cuba soon changed to aposition of removal from further involvement once he became aware of the CIA'stendency to draw out initiatives and provide itself with almost uncheckedauthority in matters of foreign covert operations.Allegations thatthe Kennedys knew of plans by the CIA to killFidel Castro, or approvedof such plans, have been debated by historians over the years.
Mongoose was meant to incite arevolution within Cuba that would result in the downfall of Castro, notCastro's assassination.During the CubanMissile Crisis Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician, with anability to obtain compromises tempering aggressive positions of key figures inthe hawk camp.
The trust the President placed in him on matters of negotiationwas such that Robert Kennedy's role in the crisis is today seen as having beenof vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full militaryengagement between the United States and Soviet Russia.
Theassassination of President Kennedyon November 22, 1963,was a brutal shock to the world, the nation and, of course, Robert and the restof the Kennedy family.
During the campaign he visited the LubavitcherRebbe, RabbiMenachem Mendel Schneerson, seeking his blessing andendorsement.In 1965 Bobbybecame the first person to summitMount Kennedy.At the timeit was the highest mountain in Canada that had not yet been climbed.
It wasnamed in honor of his brother Jack after his assassination.In June 1966,Kennedy visitedapartheid-ruled South Africaaccompaniedby his wife,EthelKennedy, and a small number of aides.
A quote from this addressappears on his memorial atArlington National Cemetery.
He spoke forcefully in favor of what hecalled the ""disaffected,"" the impoverished, and ""theexcluded,"" thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rightsstruggle and social justice campaigners, leading the Democratic party in apursuit of a more aggressive agenda to eliminate perceived discrimination onall levels.
Kennedy supporteddesegregationbusing, integration of all public facilities, theVotingRights Act of 1965and anti-poverty social programs to increaseeducation, offer opportunities for employment, and provide health care forAfrican-Americans.The administrationof President Kennedy had backed United States involvement in Southeast Asia and otherparts of the world in the frame of the Cold War.
While Robert Kennedyvigorously supported President Kennedy's earlier efforts, like his brother henever publicly advocated commitment of ground troops.
Senator Kennedy hadcautioned President Johnson against commitment of United States ground troops as earlyas 1965, but Lyndon Johnson chose to commit ground troops on recommendation ofthe rest of President Kennedy's still intact staff of advisers.
Robert Kennedydid not strongly advocate withdrawal from Vietnam until 1967, within a week ofMartin Luther King taking the same public stand.
Consistent with PresidentKennedy'sAlliancefor Progress, Robert Kennedy placed increasing emphasis on humanrights as a central focus of United States foreign policy.In 1968, PresidentJohnson began to run for reelection.
A crucial element to his campaignwas an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of areinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality.
Kennedy'spolicy objectives did not sit well with the business world, in which he wasviewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the taxincreases necessary to fund such programs of social improvement.
It was thisintense and frank mode of dialogue with which Kennedy was to continue to engagethose whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals orinitiatives.
It has been widelycommented that Robert Kennedy's campaign for the American presidency faroutstripped, in its vision of social improvement, that of President Kennedy;Robert Kennedy's offer for the presidency saw not only a continuation of theprograms he and his brother had undertaken during the President's term inoffice, but also an extension of these programs through what Robert Kennedyviewed as an honest questioning of the historic progress that had been made byPresident Johnson in the 5 years of his presidency.
If he coulddefeat McCarthy in the California primary, the leadership of the campaignthought, he would knock McCarthy out of the race and set up a one-on-oneagainstHubertHumphrey at theChicago national conventionin August.Kennedy scored amajor victory in winning the California primary.
He addressed his supportersshortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a ballroomatThe Ambassador HotelinLos Angeles,California.
Leaving theballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut,despitebeing advised to avoid the kitchen by his bodyguard, FBI agent Bill Barry.
In acrowded kitchen passageway,Sirhan Sirhan, a24-year-old Palestinian, opened fire with22-caliberrevolver.
Ahigh requiem massattendedby members of the extended Kennedy family, PresidentLyndon B Johnsonand hiswifeLadyBird Johnson, and members of the JohnsonCabinetwas held at St.
Bobby hadalways maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, but his familybelieved he should be interred in Arlington next to his brother.TheNavyBandplayedThe Navy Hymn.Theprocession passed theNew Senate Office Building, and the proceeded to theLincoln Memorialwhereit paused.
TheMarineCorps BandplayedThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.Thefuneral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24m.
