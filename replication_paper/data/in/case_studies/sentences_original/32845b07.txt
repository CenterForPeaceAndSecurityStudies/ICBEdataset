The crisis peaked on Oct., “Black Saturday,” when a series of startling events, including the shooting down of an American U-2 spy plane over Cuba, suggested that neither Khrushchev nor Kennedy fully controlled their own military machines.
The presidential aide and historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr. described the October 1962 confrontation as the “most dangerous moment in human history.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKhrushchev’s motivations in sending nuclear-tipped missiles to Cuba in the summer of 1962 have been the subject of great debate.
Kennedy administration officials argued afterward that the Soviet leader acted for global strategic reasons.
Prior to the missile crisis, the United States had around 3,500 nuclear warheads capable of reaching the Soviet Union, a 10-1 advantage over the Soviet Union.
By building missile bases in Cuba capable of lobbing 60 nuclear warheads into the United States, Khrushchev would be able to redress this military imbalance somewhat, although it would have left him far short of achieving first strike capability.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn memoirs written after his ouster as Soviet leader in 1964, Khrushchev claimed that he was primarily motivated by the desire to defend the Cuban revolution, and his ally Fidel Castro, from aggression by the United States.
The Kennedy administration had supported an abortive invasion of Cuba by right-wing exiles at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961, and had launched a campaign of sabotage against the Castro regime, known as Operation Mongoose.
It will be a terrible blow to Marxism-Leninism.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKhrushchev also had more personal reasons for wanting to get even with Kennedy, whom he regarded as an inexperienced leader young enough to be his son.
The United States had stationed medium-range Jupiter missiles in Turkey, across the Black Sea from Khrushchev’s summer retreat in Sochi.
Khrushchev intended to keep the missile deployment secret until early November, when he would travel to Havana and present the Americans with a military fait accompli.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe belated discovery of the Soviet missile deployment by an American U-2 on Oct. threw Khrushchev’s plans into disarray, and posed a huge political challenge for Kennedy.
The president had earlier insisted that the United States could not accept the deployment of Soviet “offensive” weapons in Cuba.
He now had to find a way to get Khrushchev to back down, even at the risk of nuclear war.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFortunately for Kennedy, he knew that the Soviet missiles were not yet operational.
That gave him a breathing space of a few days to privately consider his options with an ad hoc group of his closest advisers.
The Executive Committee of the National Security Council, or ExComm, included his brother Robert, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
What they did not know at the time was that the Soviet forces on Cuba were equipped with 98 tactical nuclear weapons that could have been used to wipe out an American invading force or the United States naval base at Guantánamo.
The use of these weapons on Cuba could quickly have escalated to an all-out nuclear war.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt first, Kennedy also favored air strikes against the missile sites, but changed his mind after being informed that it was impossible to guarantee complete success.
He then embraced a plan originally suggested by McNamara for a naval blockade around Cuba, as a way of demonstrating American resolve while allowing time for negotiations with Khrushchev.
The president went on television at 7m. on Oct. to announce the blockade, which he described with the more innocuous-sounding term, “quarantine.”\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Kennedy, Khrushchev initially adopted a bellicose position when he heard about the American action.
The Soviets sent up MIG fighters to try to shoot the intruder down; the Alaska Air Defense Command responded by scrambling nuclear-armed F-102 interceptors.
In the Caribbean, a frazzled Soviet submarine commander considered firing his nuclear torpedo against United States destroyers attempting to bring him to the surface.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, Soviet troops brought nuclear-tipped cruise missiles to the periphery of the Guantánamo naval base, and transported nuclear warheads to the medium-range missile sites at Sagua La Grande in central Cuba.
Convinced that an attack by the United States was imminent, Castro urged Khrushchev to consider a nuclear first strike against the United States.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat night, Kennedy sent his brother Robert to meet with Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, to offer a noninvasion pledge to Cuba and warn that time was running out.
Acting without the knowledge of most members of the ExComm, Robert Kennedy promised to withdraw United States Jupiters from Turkey within five months of a withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.
