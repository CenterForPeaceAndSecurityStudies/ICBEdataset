P IO U S Nowhere do the constitutional prerogatives of the president seem greater than in the midst of national security crises; nowhere do we invest in the president greater resources of command.
They often lack crucial information, use incomplete or misleading analogies to understand crisis situations, nd it difcult to micromanage events, and are unable to project force effectively.
They did so without revealing to the world how they had defused the crisis, a decision to maintain condentiality with far reaching consequences for subsequent presidential crisis decision making.
According to the conventional accounts, the Soviets backed down because Kennedy understood their psychology, and his national security advisers had 1 Roger Hilsman, To Move a Nation , xii.
In large measure, Kennedy’s response was shaped by domestic and international politics.
Put another way, the crisis was as much about presidential power stakes, prestige, and reputation as it was about a balance of nuclear terror.
The Soviet missile sites were soft and vulnerable to an American rst strike.
The Soviets had a large supply of 1,000-mile-range MRBMs and of 2,000-mile-range IRBMs, sufcient to cover most of the United States if launched from Cuba.
From the Soviet point of view, Kennedy’s strength and rmness—not his weakness—were the problem that the deployment of missiles was intended to address.
Khrushchev in his memoirs claimed that his principal motivation had been to forestall new United States attacks on Cuba.
This was not the rst time the question of Jupiters had preoccupied Khrushchev.
He then recommended that Turkey be notied to dismantle the missiles so that they would not be subject to a Soviet preemptive strike.
The most important “backchannel” involved KGB ofcer Georgii Bolshakov, Ambassador Dobrynin, and Attorney General Kennedy.
After the early evening ExComm meeting of the 27th, at which the Trollope ploy suggested by Tommy Thompson had been approved, President Kennedy convened a meeting in the Oval Ofce with Robert Kennedy, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, Theodore Sorensen, George Ball, Tommy Thompson, and Roswell Gilpatric.
The following day, acting on Kremlin instructions, Dobrynin was able to reassure Kennedy that the Soviets agreed to the United States insistence that the dismantling in Turkey would not occur immediately; instead, it would take place four to ve months after the crisis was resolved.
Khrushchev noted that “it is somewhat difcult for you at the present time to publicly discuss the question of eliminating the United States missile bases in Turkey,” and he agreed that the terms for ending the crisis should be considered condential.
He insisted that Dobrynin take back the letter from Khrushchev, so there would be no evidence of the exchange in the les of the United States government.
Robert Kennedy’s posthumous recollections did not include the specics of the deal.
It may be that Turkish intransigence about removal of the missiles and the difculty of getting a NATO Council meeting organized within two days to take the heat for such a proposal had led Kennedy to bypass the ExComm, the Turks, the NATO allies, and everyone else that a consultative process would have required.
Instead, Kennedy employed his own diplomatic prerogative powers, using his brother as a condential intermediary.
The term itself makes no sense in this context, because no crisis can be managed until one or both parties redene the issue to the point at which it no longer remains a crisis and gamesmanship can be supplanted by traditional diplomacy and political deal making.
At each of the stages of the game, into the nal two days, the players seem not to have understood the intentions of the cuban missile crisis and crisis management j 93 other side nor its capabilities—particularly the nuclear capabilities of the Soviets, which the United States was to underestimate throughout.
When Soviet MIGS went to intercept it, ghter aircraft from Galena Air Force base in Alaska went to its rescue.
The United States planes were armed with nuclear weapons that could be red on the pilot’s own authority.
The Soviet submarine had nuclear armed torpedoes and was authorized to re them if attacked.
Had they killed Soviet military ofcers, the Soviets might have begun shooting down United States low-ying aircraft.
The photos also showed six launchers for FROG battleeld nuclear missiles, and subsequent ights showed a total of fourteen missiles.
They also claimed to have had several nuclear bombs for their Iluyshin bombers.
Top-level ofcials such as McGeorge Bundy were unaware at the time that the military had included such weapons in its planning.
Kennedy would not have authorized rst use of such weapons, but no doubt would have sanctioned retaliatory strikes had the Russians used their tactical nuclear weapons rst.
Cuban saboteurs blew up oil reneries in Venezuela, crippling one-quarter of oil production in the Caribbean.
Rather, the crisis freed these organizations from the ordinary constraints, because a crisis by denition meant that they were acting in an uncertain environment.
Aerial reconnaissance showed the Soviet Beagle IL-28 bombers continued to be assembled at the San Julian aireld.
A U-2 ight on a routine air sampling mission from Alaska strayed into Soviet territory over the Chukhotsk peninsula in Siberia and was chased back by Soviet ghters, who nearly got into a dogght with United States planes that had scrambled to protect the U-2.
Cuban air defense troops, acting under Castro’s orders, broke away from Soviet command and control and began shooting at low-ying U.S. aircraft entering Cuban airspace.
At 10:21m. the news came in to the president that a high-ying U-2 had been shot down over Cuba by a surface-to-air missile launched from a SAM site at Banes, near the eastern tip of the island.
He communicated to Khrushchev on the 26th in a “document” dictated to a bilingual Soviet ofcer, who relayed Castro’s words to Moscow.

But he did not know that the Soviet air command in Cuba had authorized the shooting on its own initiative, without waiting for its request to re to clear in Moscow.

Had the Soviets stood rm on the 27th, the United States would have tightened the embargo and then repackaged the missile deal, presumably using the Cordier Channel, which allowed U Thant to go public with an offer to trade.
Both Kennedy and Khrushchev misplayed their hands, but eventually they made a deal because by the nal two days of the crisis they were frantically trying to keep the danger of nuclear confrontation contained.
The Soviets did not intend their missiles in Cuba to change the military balance, though Khrushchev clearly intended their placement to redress the imbalance favoring the Americans until his own ICBMs could be deployed in sufcient numbers.
Khrushchev gave strict orders to the military commanders in Cuba not to prepare these strategic missiles for ring, nor to “mate” them 65 Fursenko and Naftali, “One Hell of a Gamble,” 276.
McNamara and Kennedy assumed that the Soviets had fty to seventy-ve strategic missiles, not the twenty or so they actually possessed.
Without realizing it, the Soviets already had a deterrent against a United States rst strike, without having to place missiles in Cuba and without having to deploy missiles on their own territory.
The United States could dene a large number of actions by Castro as aggressive.
But it would have required a pledge not to invade Cuba, probably without any qualications.
But until the end of the 1980s, the cold war was marked by rivalries and localized military conicts far more than by détente.
The political dangers of seeming willing to compromise with the enemy had to be managed through the ction that no compromise had occurred.
Yet Kennedy himself was aware of the issue that the ctionalized version would open.
