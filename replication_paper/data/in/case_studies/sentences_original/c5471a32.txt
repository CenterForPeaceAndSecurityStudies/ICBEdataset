JFK would have delivered the speech if Soviet ships carrying strategic nuclear missiles had reached Cuba in October 1962, papers released from Robert F Kennedy`s personal files have revealed.
According to RFK`s papers the outcome did not happen only because JFK and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev both realised the severity of what was coming.
The Soviet ships carrying missiles to Cuba turned back following to a series of public, private and secret concessions.
Elsewhere in the documents, details of a 1964 mafia-assisted plot to assassinate Fidel Castro are outlined.
The mafia and a band of so-called ""patriotic Cuban exiles"" agreed to assassinate Castro for a payment of USD 100,000, USD 20,000 for his brother Raul and USD 20,000 for revolutionary Che Guevara.
