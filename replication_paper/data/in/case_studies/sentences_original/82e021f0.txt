The United States had been at odds with Communist ideals for many years beginning with the onset of the Cold War.
The direct stimulant for the Cuban missile crisis, however, was due to the emergence of the Communist led regime of Cuba, by Fidel Castro.
Wanting to prevent Castro from gaining too much power, President Kennedy, aided by the CIA, attempted to take control of Cuba.
This failure, known as the Bay of Pigs, only secured Castro's as well as Cuba's power.
For fear of further attacks, the Soviet Union provided protection by way of nuclear weapons, for Cuba.
The United States reached near destruction due to President Kennedy's persistent refusal to tolerate Communism, and therefore, he can not be lauded for his success in ending the crisis which he himself started.
Cuba had been a large assent for the United States throughout the 1950s, prior to President Eisenhower severing diplomatic relations with Cuba in the 1960s.
After Fidel Castro and his Revolutionaries took control of Cuba, they began to gain mass popularity and power which upset Government officials in the United States.
Eisenhower developed a plan which the Kennedy Administration later followed through on, to overthrow Castro and his Communist Regime.
It is often referred to as a docudrama as it is very entertainment oriented but still remains close to the roots of what actually happened.
Since it was produced at a later date than many other films portraying the events, Thirteen Days was able to access recently declassified information which helped in attaining a more historically accurate film.
In 1962 Fidel Castro agreed to the placing of nuclear missiles belonging to the Soviets in Cuba.
All placing of these missiles was done in secrecy, however on October 14th an American U2 plane took photographs of the missile site and the American Government was immediately informed.
