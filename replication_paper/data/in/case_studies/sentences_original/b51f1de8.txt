The Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea was always friendly with Cuba, as Cuba has always been and will continue to be with her,"" Castro said.
Because Castro feared the United States was about to invade his nation -a year after it had backed the Bay of Pigs invasion -he consulted with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about the possibility of nuclear war with the United States Ultimately, Khrushchev and United States President John F Kennedy backed away from that precipice.
So it appears the current crisis on the Korean Peninsula is bringing back memories for Castro, who seems to fear the world is once again at the brink.
