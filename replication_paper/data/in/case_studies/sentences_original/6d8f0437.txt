Shortly afterward, in his office, he told me that a U-2 had just finished a photographic mission and that the Intelligence Community had become convinced that Russia was placing missiles and atomic weapons in Cuba.
That was the beginning of the Cuban missile crisis -a confrontation between the two giant atomic nations, the United States and the U.S.S.R., which brought the world to the abyss of nuclear destruction and the end of mankind.
From that moment in president Kennedy's office until Sunday morning, October 28, that was my life -and for Americans and Russians, for the whole world, it was their life as well.
The general feeling in the beginning was that some form of action was required.
There were those, although they were a small minority, who felt the missiles did not alter the balance of power and therefore necessitated no action.
The members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were unanimous in railing for immediate military action.
They forcefully presented their view that the blockade would not be effective.
General Curtis LeMay, Air Force Chief of Staff, argued strongly with the President that a military attack was essential.
When the President questioned what the response of the Russians might be, General LeMay assured him there would be no reaction.
The President went on to say that he recognized the validity of the arguments made by the Joint Chiefs, the danger that more and more missiles would be placed in Cuba, and the likelihood, if we did nothing, that the Russians would move on Berlin and in other areas of the world, feeling the U.S, was completely impotent.
Then it would be too late to do anything in Cuba, for by that time all their missiles would be operational.
Later, Secretary McNamara, although he told the President he disagreed with the Joint Chiefs and favored a blockade rather than an attack, informed him that the necessary planes, men, and ammunition were being deployed and that we could be ready to move with the necessary air bombardments on Tuesday, October 23, if that was to be the decision.
The plans called for an initial attack, consisting of five hundred sorties, striking all military targets, including the missile sites, airfields, ports, and gun emplacements.
This was not from a deep conviction that it would be a successful course of action, but a feeling that it had more flexibility and fewer liabilities than a military attack.
With some trepidation, I argued that, whatever validity the military and political arguments were for an attack in preference to a blockade, America's traditions and history would not permit such a course of action.
Whatever military reasons he and others could marshall, they were nevertheless, in the last analysis, advocating a surprise attack by a very large nation against a very small one.
We spent more time on this moral question during the first five days than on any other single matter.
At various times, it was proposed that we send a letter to Khrushchev twenty-four hours before the bombardment was to begin, that we send a letter to Castro, that leaflets and pamphlets listing the targets be dropped over Cuba before the attack -all these ideas and more were abandoned for military or other reasons.
We struggled and fought with one another and with our consciences, for it was a question that deeply troubled us all.
Then again early Saturday morning we were back at the State Department.
He was hoping to be able to meet with us early enough to decide on a course of action and then broadcast it to the nation Sunday night.
Saturday morning at 10:00 o'clock I called the President at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago and told him we were ready to meet with him.
As he was returning to Washington, our armed forces across the world were put on alert.
Telephoning from our meeting in the State Department, Secretary McNamara ordered four tactical air squadrons placed at readiness for an air strike, in case the President decided to accept that recommendation.
The President arrived back at the White House at 1:40 P.M. and went for a swim.
Convened as a formal meeting of the National Security Council, it was a larger group of people who met, some of whom had not participated in the deliberations up to that time.
Bob McNamara presented the argument for the blockade; others presented the arguments for the military attack.
The discussion, for the most part, was able and organized, although, like all meetings of this kind, certain statements were made as accepted truisms, which I, at least, thought were of questionable validity.
One member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, argued that we could use nuclear weapons, on the basis that our adversaries would use theirs against us in an attack.
I thought, as I listened, of the many times that I had heard the military take positions which, if wrong, had the advantage that no one would be around at the end to know.
The President made his decision that afternoon in favor of the blockade.
There was on final meeting the next morning, with General Walter C Sweeney, Jr., Commander in Chief of the Tactical Air Command, who told the President that even a major surprise air attack could not be certain of destroying all the missile sites and nuclear weapons in Cuba.
That ended the small, lingering doubt that might still have remained in his mind.
It had worried him that a blockade would not remove the missiles -now it was clear that an attack could not accomplish that task completely, either.
The strongest argument against the all-out military attack, and one no one could answer to his satisfaction, was that a surprise attack would erode if not destroy the moral position of the United States throughout the world.
The next morning, Wednesday , the quarantine went into effect, and the reports during the early hours told of the Russian ships coming steadily on toward Cuba.
I talked with the President for a few moments before we went in to our regular meeting.
Secretary McNamara announced that two Russian ships, the Gagarin and the Komiles, were within a few miles of our quarantine barrier.
The interception of both ships would probably be before noon Washington time.
Indeed, the expectation was that at least one of the vessels would be stopped and bearded between 10:30 and 11:00 o'clock.
Then came the disturbing Navy report that a Russian submarine had moved into position between the two ships.
It had originally been planned to have a cruiser make the first interception, but, because of the increased danger, it was decided in the past few hours to send in an aircraft carrier supported by helicopters, carrying antisubmarine equipment, hovering overhead.
The carrier Essex was to signal the submarine by sonar to surface and identify itself.
If it refused, said Secretary McNamara, depth charges with a small explosive would be used until the submarine surfaced.
I think these few minutes were the time of gravest concern for the President.
For a few fleeting seconds, it was almost as though no one else was there and he was no longer the President.
Six ships previously on their way to Cuba at the edge of the quarantine line have stopped or have turned back toward the Soviet Union.
A short time later, the report came that the twenty Russian ships closest to the barrier had stopped and were dead in the water or had turned around.
Friday morning President Kennedy ordered the State Department to proceed with preparations for a crash program on civil government in Cuba to be established after the invasion and occupation of that country.
Secretary McNamara reported the conclusion of the military that we should expect very heavy casualties in an invasion.
John McCone said everyone should understand that an invasion was going to be a much more serious undertaking than most people had previously realized.
Despite the heavy pressure on the big decisions, President Kennedy followed every detail.
He requested, for instance, the names of all the Cuban doctors in the Miami area, should their services be required in Cuba.
Learning that a United States military ship with extremely sensitive equipment (similar to the Liberty, which was struck by Israel during the Israeli-Arab war) was very close to the coast of Cuba, he ordered it farther out to sea, where it would be less vulnerable to attack.
He supervised everything, from the contents of leaflets to be dropped over Cuba to the assembling of ships for the invasion.
A great deal has been written about this message, including the allegation that at the time Khrushchev wrote it he must have been so unstable or emotional that he had become incoherent.
There was no question that the letter had been written by him personally.
But it was not incoherent and the emotion was directed at the death, destruction, and anarchy that nuclear war would bring to his people and all mankind.
That, he said again and again and in many different ways, must be avoided.
No more weapons to Cuba and those within Cuba withdrawn or destroyed, and you reciprocate by withdrawing your blockade and also agree not to invade Cuba.
On Saturday morning, October 27, I received a memorandum from J Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that gave me a feeling of considerable disquiet.
It was therefore with some sense of foreboding that I went to the meeting of our Ex Comm.
A new, this time very formal, letter had arrived from Khrushchev to President Kennedy.
It was obviously no longer Mr Khrushchev personally who was writing, but the Foreign Office of the Kremlin.
The letter was quite different from the letter received twelve hours before.
To add to the feeling of foreboding and gloom, Secretary McNamara reported increasing evidence that the Russians in Cuba were now working day and night, intensifying their efforts on all the missile sites and on the IL-28s.
The change in the language and tenor of the letters from Khrushchev indicated confusion within the Soviet Union; but there was confusion among us as well.
At that moment, not knowing exactly what to suggest, some recommended writing to Khrushchev and asking him to clarify his two letters.
Yet we realized that, as we sat there, the work was proceeding on the missile sites in Cuba, and we now had the additional consideration that if we destroyed these sites and began an invasion, the door was clearly open for the Soviet Union to take reciprocal action against Turkey.
The NATO countries were supporting our position and recommending that the United States be firm; but, President Kennedy said, they did not realize the full implications for them.
If we carried out an air strike against Cuba and the Soviet Union answered by attacking Turkey, all NATO was going to be involved.
Then, immediately, the President would have to decide whether he would use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, and all mankind would be threatened.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff joined the meeting and recommended their solution.
It had the attraction of being a very simple next step -an air strike on Monday, followed shortly afterward by an invasion.
They pointed out to the President that they had always felt the blockade to be far too weak a course and that military steps were the only ones the Soviet Union would understand.
They were not at all surprised that nothing had been achieved by limited force, for this is exactly what they had predicted.
In the midst of these deliberations, another message came, to change the whole course of events and alter history.
Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., from South Carolina, one of the two Air Force pilots who had carried out the original U-2 reconnaissance that uncovered the presence of missiles in Cuba, had since flown several other photo-reconnaissance missions and was flying one that Saturday morning, October 27.
Our meeting was interrupted by the report that his plane had been hit by a SAM missile, that it had crashed in Cuba, and that he had been killed.
There was the knowledge that we had to take military action to protect our pilots.
And there was the feeling that the noose was tightening on all of us, on Americans, on mankind, and that the bridges to escape were crumbling.
The President ordered the Ex Comm to meet again at 9:00 P.M. in the White House.
While the letter was being typed and prepared for transmission, he and I sat in his office.
He talked about Major Anderson and how it is always the brave and the best who die.
The politicians and officials sit home pontificating about great principles and issues, make the decisions, and dine with their wives and families, while the brave and the young die.
And yet if events continue as they have in the last several days, that struggle -which no one wishes, which will accomplish nothing -will engulf and destroy all mankind.
He wanted to make sure that he had done everything in his power, everything conceivable, to prevent such a catastrophe.
Every opportunity was to be given to the Russians to find a peaceful settlement which would not diminish their national security or be a public humiliation.
It was not only for Americans that he was concerned, or primarily the older generation of any land.
The thought that disturbed him the most, and that made the prospect of war much more fearful than it would otherwise have been, was the specter of :he death of the children of this country and all the world -the young people who had no role, who had no say, who knew nothing even of the confrontation, but whose lives would be snuffed out like everyone else's.
They would never have a chance to make a decision, to vote in an election, to run for office, to lead a revolution, to determine their own destinies.
But the great tragedy was that, if we erred, we erred not only for ourselves, our futures, our hopes, and our country, but for the lives, futures, hopes, and countries of those who had never been given an opportunity to play a role, to vote aye or nay, to make themselves felt.
I telephoned Ambassador Dobrynin about 7:15 P.M. and asked him to come to the Department of Justice.
The President was not optimistic, nor was I He ordered twenty-four troop-carrier squadrons of the Air Force Reserve to active duty.
He had not abandoned hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours.
I had promised my daughters for a long time that I would take them to the Horse Show, and early Sunday morning I went to the Washington Armory to watch the horses jump.
He said he had just received word from the Russians that they had agreed to withdraw the missiles from Cuba.
I went immediately to the White House, and there I received a call from Ambassador Dobrynin, saying he would like to visit with me.
He told me that the message was coming through that Khrushchev had agreed to dismantle and withdraw the missiles under adequate supervision and inspection; that everything was going to work out satisfactorily; and that Mr Khrushchev wanted to send his best wishes to the President and to me.
I went back to the White House and talked to the President for it long time.
While I was there, he placed telephone calls to former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower.
As I closed the door, he was seated at the desk writing a letter to Mrs.
