Multiple Sources Review on: 31 December 1985 THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF AND EFFORTS TO CONTAIN CASTRO, 1960-1964 As the decade of the 1960s opened, much of Latin America seemed ripe for revolution.
Already, in Cuba, Fulgencio Batista had been driven from power by Fidel Castro, who promised social justice and political freedom.
Castro did promulgate social reforms, but he then proceeded to turn Cuba into a communist state.
In Latin America, the competition between communism and democracy had begun.
The 1960s, he anticipated, would be ""the years of maximum progressmaximum effort, the years when the greatest obstacles must be overcome, the years when the need for assistance will be the greatest."" (arf The Castro challenge also compelled a reappraisal of h emisphe ric defense policies.
U£) The Joint Chiefs of Staff found serious flaws in several of these ideas.
According to ISA's paper, the Western Hemisphere had the most capability to deal with the least likely threat — external attack — and the least capacity to cope with the most probable danger — insurgency.
According to General Lemnitzer, the Latins deeply resented, as gross interference in their internal affairs, United States efforts to tell them how large their military establishments ought to be.
First, include a strategic appraisal of Latin America's military importance.
Second, prepare guidance for each country on possible actions to prevent a communist takeover.
Third, defer establishment of an Inter-American Security Force until the concept could be tested in the Caribbean.
Fourth, speak of ""arms limitation"" rather than ""arms control""; United States influence could be exerted far more effectively through MAP than through any controls resulting from regional or bilateral agreements.
Fifth, take note that bilateral agreements permitting the provision of United States assistance against indirect aggression appeared to be militarily undesirable.
The United States would be obliged, to keep current regimes in power; there would be difficulties in determining whether opposition movements were actually communist; and the Latin countries involved in such agreements would be surrendering some of their sovereignty.
In any case, they reminded Secretary of Defense Robert S McNamara, one state always had the right to assist another when so requested.

Indeed, most countries could not absorb all the out-ofcountry training that had been offered.
They therefore proposed greater use of in-country training and provision of additional materiel. (jtfl The President prodded the Joint Chiefs of Staff again in October 1961.
During an inspection of Special Forces at Fort Bragg, the Chief Executive asked General George H Decker, the Chief of Staff of the Army, what more the United States military, in conjunction with their Latin counterparts, could do.
The JCS reply, forwarded to President Kennedy on 30 Novembe r, offered numerous recommendations.

In January, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent Secretary McNamara a list of 46 such projects.

At President Kennedy's urging, Congress changed MAP ' s primary purpose from hemispheric to internal defense.
TOPSS^ ET (/A After a review, the Joint Chiefs of Staff made several reservations known to Mr McNamara.
Civic' action, they argued, should be undertaken not only by MAP-supported units but also with a country's own resources.
Such an approach would be consistent with both the principles of self-help and the ceiling upon MAP funding.
Rather, MAPsupported units should perform only such civic action tasks as were ancillary to their military mission and lay within their organic capabilities.
The team found that there was still time to take corrective action, even in countries where the problems were most serious.
As a rule, indigenous internal security forces could maintain order and suppress outbreaks of urban violence.
The communists could neither overthrow any government nor sustain a large-scale struggle.

TOP S^ET ^) The Joint Chiefs of Staff readily agreed with the team about the need for increased internal security assistance and more coordinated executive guidance.
But they opposed any wholesale revision of the United States military program.
A recent consolidation of Service Missions with MAAGs should alleviate some of the difficulties.
As for bilateral agreements, they feared that the United States might lose more in renegotiation than it would gain.
Lastly, they criticized the team for failing to stress sufficiently the importance of civic action programs and military participation therein.
Subsequently, ISA reviewed bilateral agreements and concluded that no revisions were needed.
Otherwise, however, ISA endorsed all the teams' s proposals, including the proposition that military 13 • v"") ""Mission to South America South American Assessment Team,"" 3 Jan 62, Att to JCS 1976/405, 6 Feb 62; JMF 9130 sec 2.

In April 1962, General Lyman L Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented OSD with a Civic Action Plan for Ecuador costing about $1. million.
Phase I involved primarily road building and water supply; Phase II emphasized school construction, water supply, and public health; Phase III stressed colonization, advanced agriculture, and education.

Subsequently, CINCARIB sent the JCS bi-monthly status reports on these projects.
Ultimately, however, the Defense Department authorized and funded CCC projects in Bolivia and El Salvador . (jfi In September 1962, Secretary McNamara flew to the Panama Canal Zone and conferred with CINCARIB ; also in attendance were General Leranitzer, Major General Victor Krulak, SACSA, and the Director of Military Assistance, General Robert J Wood.
General O'Meara stressed that the chief problem was Congress' $57. million MAP ceiling.
But the United States was heavily involved in ASW programs; these would have to be augmented ($12. million was presently planned) in order to receive a return on earlier investments.

The Chairman subsequently recommended, and the Secretary approved, projects requiring $3,417 million in DOD and $1. million in AID funds.

As tp economic development, military services in all Latin countries were participating in civic action projects. >s1 On 27 February 1963, a State-DefenseAID message went to CINCARIB and the various Embassies explaining that internal security and civic action were now MAP's primary purposes.

Accordingly, in May, the State Department drafted guidance that United States officials could use in explaining the program.
ISA, thinking that some of State's language might intensify Latin misgivings, wrote a revision intended to make clear that increased internal security would allow the Latin military to contribute more effectively to hemisphere defense.

The State Department, the Special Group , and ISA all favored some prompt expression of United States support for the new regime.
ISA wanted MAP raised from $9. to $12. million; the United States Ambassador advocated an increase to $20 million.
They dismissed ISA's proposal as too small to demonstrate United States support and likely to offend Brazilian sensibilities.
And, since Congress had set a $55 million ceiling on material aid for Latin American, there would have to be compensating cuts in other country programs — a process that would disrupt orderly planning, deprive countries of critical assets, and shake their confidence in United States reliability.
Unfortunately, United States efforts to discourage jet aircraft purchases proved an almost complete failure.
Early in 1962, CINCARIB had told Secretary McNamara that Communists occupied key positions in the Brazilian Army and government, and that the country might go Communist in three years.
Cunha, ""Report of Conference — Caribbean Command,"" 5 Feb 62; JMF 5410 . / early and strong effort"" be made either to remove the $55 million ceiling or raise it to $75 million.
Once that was done, a $20 million Brazilian program should be approved for planning purposes.
Credit assistance and costsharing proposals also ought to be prepared at an .early date.
Cuba would, of course, be rather like performing ""Hamlet"" without the Prince.
Secretary of the Army Cyrus Vance became Mr McNamara' s executive agent on all Cuban matters; General Earl G Wheeler, who had become Chief of Staff of the Army in October 1963, acted as JCS representative.
If the former, the policy statement should say that the Uni ted States would ""^ If the latter, it should speak simply of being ""prepared, as appropriate opportunities present themselves,"" to do these things.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, unsurprisingly, urged adoption of the former course, and recommended that repeated lowlevel reconnnaissance flights over Cuba be included among the possible courses of action.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirmed their preference for more drastic actions.
One possibility involved Defense Department, accordingly, adopted this position.
See, for example, JCSM-809-63 to SecDef, 21 Oct 63, Encl A to JCS 2304/205-1; JMF 9123/3100 sec 1.

Mr Vance asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to propose plans for air-sea surveillance.
On 20 January, they and Secretary McNamara charged CINCLANT with monitoring all ship movements into Venezuela, in order t© obtain a sampling of shipping density.
CINCLANT concluded that, although surveillance could be accomplished, boarding and searching all ships would be such a daunting task that firm intelligence about subversion traffic was absolutely vital.
On 17 February, CINCLANT outlined before Secretary McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff a scheme for disrupting Cuban arms traffic; they promptly approved it, as the basis for a detailed plan.
Still, when the Joint Chiefs of Staff conferred with him on 4 March 1964, the President asked them for a list of measures that might add to Castro's troubles.
General Curtis E LeMay, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, more explicitl y, insisted tha t The longer we refrain from positive 32.
Therefore, he proposed saying The Joint Chief of Staff believe that the ultimate.
Finally, General Maxwell D Taylor, who had been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff since October 1962, circulated a draft that, with minor additions, won JCS approval.
In this ' memorandum, which went to the White House on 21 March, they recommended a resumption of the program . . . involving the employment of [covert assets to conduct interdependent operations, including the covert collection of intelligence, propaganda actions, economic denial actions, and externally-mounted sabotage operations against Cuba.l As this program unfolds, they would favor expanding and intensifying it while maintaining a continuing evaluation of the reaction of Castro, the communists, and the Free World.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff continue to believe that the ultimate United States objective toward Cuba must be to establish a government in Cuba that is acceptable to the United States.
However, they have difficulty identifying promising actions rop SEj^ET against Castro which have not been previously considered, and in some cases tried. it is a hard fact that little remains which offer promise of real effectiveness in removing Castro short of a blockade or an ascending scale of military action up to or including invasion.
They will keep this problem under continuing review and advise you should any new and promising^ courses of action be uncovered.
So, for the remainder of the 1960s, something of a stalemate persisted.
Fidel Castro continued to control Cuba, but he made few converts in Latin America.
The gravest peril appeared in Boliva, where Castro's lieutenant Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara failed completely; in 1967, he was captured and killed.
Thus, in the Western Hemisphere, counterinsurgency must be counted a success.
In November^ the JCS sent Secretary McNamara a plan for attacking the sugar industry which, they thought, merited ""serious consideration.
