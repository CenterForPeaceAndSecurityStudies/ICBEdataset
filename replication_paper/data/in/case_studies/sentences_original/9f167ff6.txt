In 1962 there were growing concerns that the Soviet Union was preparing to secretly supply missiles to Cuba, missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.
This posed a particular risk to the United States with Cuba only 90 miles south of Florida.
On October 16 United States intelligence officials presented Kennedy with photographs showing nuclear missile bases under construction in Cuba.
An attack on Cuba could trigger a global war, but ignoring the threat of this missile build-up could also risk war.
Kennedy and his advisors agreed that a surprise air attack against Cuba was the only reasonable response.
However, some recommended a blockade as a possible prelude to negotiations.
Kennedy went ahead with the blockade; at the same time, the United States military began moving soldiers and equipment into position.
After a series of private negotiations and diplomatic maneuvers, on October 28, 1962, Khrushchev announced their decision to withdraw the missiles from Cuba in return for a ""noninvasion pledge"" from the United States.
The Cold War began to thaw as both super powers realized how close to the brink of nuclear war they had come.
