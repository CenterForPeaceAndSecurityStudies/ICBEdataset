DEFCON is “Defense Readiness Condition” and level 3 is the state of being more ready than required.
Kennedy and the rest of the United States defense saw this act as a threat.
October 23rd, Kennedy signed the proclamation for a naval blockade around Cuba to keep supplies from going in or leaving Cuba.
This act was most likely going to cause some sparks to fly between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Communication was back and forth between President Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev, and Ambassador Dobrynin.
He’s saying that despite the fact that the missiles were being built and shipped in utter secret into Cuba and that those missiles had a very specific range to hit the US, that they were, in fact, just for protecting Cuba.
Before Cuba was alligned with the Soviet Union they were with the United States after the Cold War.
The day after the proclamation of the Cuban Quarantine the Soviet Union Ships heading for Cuba turned back except for one ship that tried to slip through.
The United States military went to DEFCON 2, which is right below maximum readiness which is practically starting a war.
Due to issues with interacting with the leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro – who refused to have his territory inspected by the United States Military and the stubbornness of both American and Russian parties there might have been an actual war on their hands.
After another long communication and meeting and negotiations the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw from Cuba if the United States removed their set up missiles in turkey which were prepared to retaliate.
