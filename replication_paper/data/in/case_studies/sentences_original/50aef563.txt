In response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961 and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles on the island to deter a future invasion.
Meanwhile, the 1962 United States elections were underway, and the White House had denied charges for months that it was ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles from Florida.
After consultation with them, Kennedy ordered a naval blockade on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.
After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev Publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a United States public declaration and agreement to avoid invading Cuba again.
Secretly, the United States agreed that it would dismantle all US-built Jupiter MRBMs, which had been deployed in Turkey against the Soviet Union; there has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well.
A series of agreements later reduced USâ€“Soviet tensions for several years until both parties began to build their nuclear arsenals even further.
