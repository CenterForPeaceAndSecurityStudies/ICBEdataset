One of the consequences of this was that both sides wished to get that close again, and it left Kennedy and America as the winners in the eyes of most independent spectators.
America felt vulnerable with The Soviets having missile based on a friendly country that were in striking range of nearly all American cities.
It appeared to the world that Khrushchev had backed down and had conceded all the key points to Kennedy.
Another example of American victory was Kennedyâ€™s ability to keep the agreement that would remover her missiles in Turkey.
As a result it appeared to the world that Kennedy had conceded nothing.
In the absence of any actual fighting between America and the Soviet Union the ability to win prestige was doubly important.
Although Kennedy superficially came out of the crisis better, America did loose in some respects.
The policy of containment had been shown not to be working, thus proved a failure when the thousand paratroopers where massacred by the guerrilla army at the Bay of Pigs.
Cuba was communist country, fully in support of Russia close to America.
This limited American influence in Europe, and although in general not public, left Kennedy and America unable to act as freely as she had with an immediate nuclear threat.
The impression that many in and outside Russia gained that Khrushchev was a weak leader contributed to his downfall two years later.
