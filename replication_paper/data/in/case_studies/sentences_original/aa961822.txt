The Soviets had installed nuclear missile silos in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of the United States.
United States armed forces were put at their highest state of readiness.
Soviet field commanders in Cuba were authorized to use nuclear weapons if invaded by the United States The fate of millions literally hinged on the ability of two men, John F Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, to reach a compromise.
Missiles in Cuba would double the soviet strategic arsenal and discourage a potential United States attack against the Soviet Union.
For the United States the crisis began on October 15, 1962 when our planes spotted Soviet missile silos under construction.
United States airplanes with special cameras documented they did exist.
Kennedy announced that an attack by Cuba would be considered an attack by the Soviet Union.
Readiness level was raised to DEFCON 2 and the quarantine line was pulled back on October 25th.
Khrushchev proposed removing the Soviet missiles if the United States promised not to invade Cuba.
On the same day Khrushchev sent a letter demanding removal of our nuclear missile in Turkey in exchange for the removal of their nuclear weapons in Cuba.
Tensions began to ease when Khrushchev announced he would remove the missiles on October 28th.
The United States had agreed to discuss removal of their missiles in Turkey only after the missiles were taken out of Cuba.
The Soviets then withdrew the missiles and returned them to the Soviet Union The key players in the Cuban missile crisis were John Kennedy, Fidel Castro, and Nikita Khrushchev.
John Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts on May 29, 1917, a descendent of Irish Catholics who had immigrated to America in the previous century.
