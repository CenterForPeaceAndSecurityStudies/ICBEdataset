But two aspects of the movie grossly distort reality.First, with the exception of Robert Kennedy, the advisers assembled around the president neither develop as characters in their own right nor even resemble the real-life men.
McNamara and Kennedy adviser Dean Acheson are cartoons, recognizable only in the one case by steel-rimmed glasses and a pompadour and in the other by a guardsman's mustache.Second, the movie misrepresents the military.
Viewers who know this movie is about a real event will leave the theater shivering with the understanding of what the Cold War could have brought.Second, Thirteen Days makes comprehensible--better than most written histories of the crisis, despite all the additional documentation and detail they've provided--the awful predicament that President Kennedy faced.
The movie gets this right where so many histories have not.Finally, the film succeeds in representing the presidency as demanding very high intelligence and cool judgment.
