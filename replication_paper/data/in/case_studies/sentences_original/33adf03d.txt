You are not successful, you are not happy—and you can’t be, because you are oppressed by Jews, Christians, conservatives, “white European males,” males in general, or some other perceived privileged class.
But understanding that there is a cause for every effect goes beyond “victim” ideology.
It may not be polite to put it this way, but many feel that their lives are in the proverbial toilet.
For many of these individuals, all outward signs say they are successful.
But after the laughter stops, after the joyride ends, there is emptiness.
People believe they have done all the things they were told would make them happy, but they are not happy.
On this subject, the dramatic rise in Chinese prosperity could teach us something.
The Chinese today are four times richer than they were 20 years ago, and people... have opportunities and creature comforts unheard of a generation ago.
Some turn to alcohol or drugs for the answer, but those taking this path find that it does not satisfy in the end.
There is a cause for happiness, just as there are causes for depression, emptiness, and loneliness.
Some causes of depression may be genetic or clinical, but these do not explain why so many find life unsatisfying.
There is a cause for success, and blaming others for your personal failure does nothing to solve the problem.
Looe Addressing the Real Cause The answer has been here all along, but most refuse to accept it.
We find it difficult to admit that the choices we make might be the problem.
It is so much easier to play our personal “victim card” than to admit that our choices might be the cause for the effect we find ourselves experiencing.
From an early age, we think we know what will make us happy, when we really do not.
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat.
He is addressing those who hunger and thirst for fulfillment in life but are coming up empty.
You see a lot of unhappy people who are seeking happiness in all the wrong ways and in all the wrong places.
You see people on aroller coaster ride of highs and lows, going from thrills and excitement to boredom and depression.
You see people striving for more and more of what they already have, thinking that if they only had a little more, they would be content and full.
A Different Way of Life We were created to have a relationship with our Creator and to live the way of outgoing concern for our fellow human beings.
We must learn and practice the way of give, the way of outgoing concern for others.
This is a hard sell to our physical minds, because it sounds so counterintuitive.
This is certainly not the way a child thinks while he is standing in acandy store with a rack full of sugary sweets before his eyes.
Yet, as we should all know from experience, that new item quickly becomes old, and what we thought would make us happy only does so for a short time before leaving us empty again.
God counsels us to come to Him and fill the empty soul with that which lasts, that which comes without money and without price.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.
We are not mere victims in this life, constantly unable to change our future.

Although it was understood to be a close call during those 13 tense days in October, few would learn just how close it was until decades later—and most people still do not know.
That is ancient history to younger generations, and details have faded for those of us who actually lived through that time.
This subtle change seemed innocuous enough when I was in school in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but it has continued to evolve.
Students in junior high, high school, and university are being pumped full of propaganda involving “male privilege” (especially white male privilege), women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, illegal immigrant rights, socialism, and anything else social engineers may conjure up to destroy long-held morals and values.
Of course, not all schools are alike, and not all students are in the dark.
Many bright young people study on their own and are well-informed, and some schools offer strong courses in both ancient and modern history.
Two Weeks in October In the years after World War II, newsreels often preceded feature films in American theaters.
I still remember how these newsreels often praised Fidel March-April 2020 | Tomorrow's World 5 ONE DECISION AWAY Castro and his Cuban revolutionaries, before—to the dismay of the United States government—Castro declared his allegiance to communism and the Soviet Union.
An anxious United States government, fearing a potential enemy just 90 miles away, authorized support for the infamous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, which ended disastrously.
Yet, the problem was real—as was demonstrated all too clearly when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev secretly moved more than 41,000 troops into Cuba between July and October 1962.
That was a bridge too far for the United States and a direct challenge to its young leader, President John F Kennedy.
Kennedy consulted with top military brass and advisors and chose what history shows was a wise response—to quarantine Cuba.
Diplomats chose that term to avoid the word blockade, which would have amounted to a declaration of war.
Most of this was known to anyone paying attention at the time, but there was far more going on under the surface that would only become known decades later, following the release of formerly Top Secret documents.
These were designed to give warning and coax the sub to the surface, not to destroy it.
What the United States did not know at the time was that submarine B-59 carried a nuclear-tipped torpedo with about two-thirds the explosive power of the atomic bomb that had been used on Hiroshima— enough to destroy much of the nearby United States naval fleet.
The men on that submarine, however, had been underwater and out of communication with Moscow for several days, and they did not know that the depth charge explosions occurring around them were only meant as warnings.
Officers aboard B-59 wondered if war between the superpowers had already begun—after all, the missile crisis had made this a real possibility.
HAD THEY LAUNCHED, YOU AND | MIGHT NOT BE HERE TO READ THIS conn times posen, ONE DECISION AWAY Eisenhower believed that there would never be a limited nuclear exchange—once one bomb went off, it would quickly escalate.
The aftermath would have touched us all, and our world would be vastly different than it is today.
What is generally unknown, and only revealed with the release of documents decades later, is the response America already had planned for such an attack.
Nevertheless, the United States nuclear arsenal grew massively during his eight years as the leader of the free world.
Yet Americans were deliberately kept in the dark about their overwhelming superiority in nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.
Each of those Atlas, Titan, Polaris, and Minuteman missiles carried multiple nuclear devices that could each attack independent targets.
Under the SIOP, the United States would shoot the works, firing off its entire strategic arsenal of 3,500 weapons.
Newly elected President Kennedy was briefed on SIOP in December 1960, but he may not have fully comprehended it immediately.
A Top Secret report declassified in 2011 reveals SIOP as it existed in 1962.
Radioactivity would no doubt take multiple millions of lives in the aftermath, perhaps the reason one report estimated a figure as high as 600,000,000 deaths.
This does not include millions of casualties inflicted on the free world, and although the USSR’s response to SIOP would perhaps have been less overwhelming, anyone who thinks the Soviet planners were any more civilized is naive.
If mankind can think in these terms, actually carrying out such mass destruction is not out of the question.
These casualty figures are even more shocking powers, agreed to launch a nuclear-tipped torpedo.
The Soviet Union was as worried as the United States about an accidental nuclear war.
Other classified documents released in recent years fill in details of other near catastrophes.
As we have already seen, Soviet submarine B-59 was in the dark about the state of the world above the waves.
United States forces were trying to force it to surface, but Soviet Captain Savitsky and political officer Maslennikov, thinking they were under attack and that war may have already begun between the super8 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 States admits to having 32 Broken Arrow incidents.
Six of these involved weapons that were never found or were deliberately left undisturbed.
You would probably find one or more of interest depending on where you live, as these incidents took place in British Columbia, Quebec, England, Spain, North and South Carolina, California, Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Louisiana, and Indiana, to name a few.
It is likely that the total number of Broken Arrow incidents is far greater—the Soviet Union is much more secretive, so their own mishaps are not publicly known.
One was at an air base in England that occurred a year before my family was transferred there.
On July 27, 1956, a United States B-47 bomber was on a training exercise when it crashed into a nuclear weapons storage facility at the Lakenheath Air Base in Suffolk, England.
Known as an “igloo,” the storage facility contained three Mark 6 nuclear bombs, one of whose detonators had been sheared off in the accident.
On January 24, 1961, a B-52 carrying two threeor four-megaton nuclear bombs was over Goldsboro, North Carolina when it suffered the structural failure of its right wing.
In 2013, a freedom of information request confirmed that only a single switch out of four had prevented the bomb’s detonation.
We also know that future wars will be fought with weapons unknown to the public at this time.
While new weapons are often kept secret for years before the public becomes aware of them, there may yet be weapons of even more destructive power in our future, so advanced that even scientists in our most secret laboratories have not yet dared to imagine them.
Revelation describes some kind of weapon that will not kill, but for a period of five months will “torment... like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
But at some point mankind’s high-tech weapons may be rendered useless or insufficient.
Bally Bust: The Death of aCulture In April 2019, Global News reporter Jules Knox filed an article revealing that senior health care is now the fastest-growing sector of British Columbia's economy.
Across the nation of Canada, fewer workers are available to fill jobs of many descriptions.
Financial Post columnist Joe Chidley recently warned that the economic stagnation fueling concerns in the Western world may long be with us.
Its root causes have little to do with global economic competition, as many mistakenly presume, but rather stem from internal issues within Western nations.
During the United States’ 2016 presidential election, the winning candidate promised an annual economic growth rate of 4 to 5 percent.
Even so, this is much better than the growth rate in most Western economies.
Gross Domestic Product in Germany and the United Kingdom grew by just 0. percent last year, and in France by 0. percent, next to which Canada looked very good at 1. percent.
Unexpected Causes Many demographers and economists foresaw this stagnation as the inevitable result of a major cultural change in Western nations.
For a population to replace itself, there must generally be an average birthrate of at least 2. babies per woman, yet many nations no longer reach this benchmark.
Joel Kotkin, writing for Forbes in February 2017, noted that only one nation in 1995 had more people over age 65 than under age 15.
When the number of seniors is greater than the number of youths, nations must revise economic and social policy.
As the aging workforce retires, fewer young people are available to fill jobs, pay taxes, and support pensions.
In France, measures taken to adjust for this have already led to considerable civil unrest and the rise of the “Yellow Vest” protest movement.
To illustrate this in another way, Kotkin explains that in 1990 there were 4. working-age Germans for every German over age 65.
At the present rate, the ratio in 2050 will be 1. working people for every retired German.
The same issue exists TomorrowsWorld.org in Canada and the U.S., though immigration has somewhat reduced the scope of the problem.
Chidley and others stress the connection between declining and aging populations and decline in GDP growth.
It follows that an aging population will buy fewer goods—reducing consumption and thus causing a drop in production.
Women in the Workforce During the two World Wars of the twentieth century, women in Allied countries made a huge contribution to their nations’ war efforts by taking factory jobs, freeing men for military service.
Following World War II, a cultural shift began as many women remained or wanted to remain in the workforce.
Diane Watts, researcher for pro-family advocacy group REAL Women of Canada, explains in an interview with Tomorrow's World Viewpoint (“The History of Feminism and Its Impact on Men,” August 7, 2019) that modern feminism demands that women see themselves as victims, needing “freedom” to work and do what they want, liberated from the “burden” of husbands and children.
This worldview sees child-rearing as an obstacle to a woman's path to success.
This has brought us to the point where, today, many married women feel they must work to meet family needs.
Additionally, many parents feel they cannot afford to have more than one child.
If both parents are working, for instance, there are day-care costs to consider.
The War Against the Family Contemporary social values undermine and weaken the traditional family unit.
Moral relativism and political correctness are sabotaging the acceptance of a family unit composed of a breadwinning father and a devoted BABY BUST mother who provides for the needs of the home—with both parents teaching their children the moral absolutes of right and wrong.
Nowhere is this war being waged more brutally than in abortion facilities.
The more brutally Guttmacher Institute reported than in abortion that, between 2010 and 2014, facilities.
This translates to 56 millegalized lion deaths of unborn children anabortion has nually.
The economic impact birthrates. of the loss of those 600,000 lives will be felt by Canadians for many years to come.
In the West, growing rejection of biblical values has removed absolute moral standards that long sustained the place of the traditional family.
This deterioration threatens the continuance of the nation’s social and economic order and the individual fulfillment and happiness of its citizens.
The “gray hairs” are a remarkable prediction of the aging state of the English-speaking world today.
All of us long to achieve a happy, contented state of mind, but so many of us find it perpetually out of reach.
When we look at the world around us, it is clear that something is wrong.

As reported by United States News and World Report, “Adolescent depression is on the rise.
Clearly, the United States is living proof that happiness is not found in collecting an abundance of physical things.
Because it suggests that happiness is far more our own decision—far more under our own control—than most people realize.
Whether we are rich or poor, healthy or ill, young or old, extrovert or introvert, we can take steps to achieve the contentment, peace, and happiness we desire.
In the rest of this article, we’ll discuss seven steps we can take to find more happiness in life.
Others may be steps you already know you should take but have been putting off.
Let’s consider the following steps we can take to bring more lasting happiness into our lives.
But there is something rejuvenating about regularly taking the time to experience some of God’s creation.
In our world of steel-and-concrete buildings, artificial light, plastic tools and utensils, and constant distractions, it may be challenging to pause from time to time and seek access to the natural world, to connect with nature and its God.
If we want to take a step toward increasing happiness in our lives, we should regularly seek to spend time enjoying nature.
Minimize Your Social Media Time Accomplishing our first step will get us away from our laptops and smartphones more often, which is related to a second step toward finding more happiness: Disconnect from social media.
Ironically, while social media is touted as a way to bring us all closer together, studies have shown that it often increases people’s loneliness and unhappiness.
Specifically, she examined the effect of decreasing one’s use of Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
She noted that “Using less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases March-April 2020 | Tomorrow's World 13 SEVEN STEPS TQ HAPPINESS in both depression and loneliness.
Some of the existing literature on social media suggests there’s an enormous amount of social comparison that happens.
When you look at other people’s lives, particSTUDIES UNDENIABLY SHOW THAT REDUCING OUR TIME ON SOCIAL ularity was significantly related to higher morning and evening happiness, healthiness and calmness during the week.
Researchers found that, even when sleep could not be increased, going to bed and getting up at roughly the same times every day enhanced people’s feelings of happiness, healthiness, and peacefulness.
Poor health is a source of stress and unhappiness like no other, and of course, many of us Mi [ f} A N [ A t AS [ C (} l} B H APP N FS C suffer health conditions beyond our control.
Hunt nor we at Tomorrow’s World suggest that we must abandon all social media.
Nevertheless, studies undeniably show that reducing our time with it often does increase our happiness.
Gerald Weston, this magazine’s Editor in Chief, discusses this topic in great detail in his March-April 2018 Tomorrow’s World article “Tame the Social Media Monster!,” which you can find at Tomorrows World.org.
Treat Your Body Well To take a third step toward increased happiness, tend to your health.
Yet all around us we see people sacrificing their sleep to jobs, to passing pleasures— even to smartphones.
In June 2017, ScienceDaily reported on a study suggesting that there is a direct connection between regular sleep habits and happiness—even when the amount of sleep is deficient.
If we treat our bodies well, we can find much more happiness than some might expect, even in the middle of otherwise difficult health challenges.
Our next step may surprise you, but it is vital— especially for those who are suffering and who are tempted to give in to feelings of despair and defeat.
Be Relentlessly Thankful We may sometimes be tempted to dwell on the problems in our lives.
Nobody’s life is perfect, and it is easy to become depressed by comparing our lives to the lives of others.
We noted earlier that this is one of the dangers of excessive social media use.
Anyone familiar with biology can quickly recognize that rabbits do not lay eggs.
Rabbits are noted for their proclivity to reproduce quickly, and eggs are considered a symbol of fertility.
Many who celebrate the holiday do not recognize that Easter is not a biblical holiday at all—it is derived from pre-Christian celebrations of springtime fertility, devoted to pagan goddesses with names such as Ishtar, Astarte, and Ostara, from whom the name “Easter” is derived.
Also, those who make a pun on “Son rise” and “sunrise” may not be aware that their Easter morning “sunrise” service—facing the direction of the rising sun during their worship—is directly condemned in Scripture.
In Ezekiel 8:14-16, we find the Israelites “weeping for Tammuz” in a sunrise worship service, a practice God states that He abhors.
He makes it just as plain in Deuteronomy 12:29-32, stating that He does not want to be worshipped in the manner that pagans worship their own gods.
Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, and Christ would be in ~~ the grave for that same length of You may be time.
So, Christians should not be celebrating anon-Christian holiday using bunnies and eggs and other symbols of fertility taken from pagan rites.
They should be observing the Passover, as commanded by Christ and the Apostles, as the true memorial of His sacrifice.
March-April 2020 | Tomorrow’s World [5 |Beyateroye) The Deciaration of Arbroath and Brexit ver since the Acts of Union in 1707 brought the kingdoms of Scotland and England together as Great Britain, Scotland has borne a somewhat strained relationship with her more powerful neighbour to the south.
The recent general election in December 2019, when the SNP won 48 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the UK Parliament, has emboldened those pressing to leave.
It takes us back to the ancient origins of the Scottish people and currently unrecognized familial bonds to the nations around them.
When the Scottish monarch Alexander III of the House of Dunkeld died in 1286, the Scottish barons invited Edward | of England to mediate between opposing contenders to the throne.
Instead, Edward violently coerced the Scots to swear allegiance to him.
Robert |, known as Robert the Bruce, subsequently fought against the English led by Edward II, winning a decisive battle for Scotland at Bannockburn in 1314.
JD ae eee pe a ee payee Diplomatic Letters Through repeated letters, the pope sought to end hostilities between the two Catholic countries.
He refused, however, to acknowledge Robert the Bruce as Scotland's legitimate king, so a letter known as the Declaration of Arbroath—dated 6 April 1320 and bearing the signatures and personal seals of 39 Scottish nobles—was written to Pope John XXII in Avignon, France, explaining the Scottish position on the conflict with England.
In 1237, King Alexander II and the barons of his day sent Pope Gregory IX a peace treaty negotiated with England in the presence of a papal legate and told the pope of their plans to abide by it.
So, writing to inform the pope of their perception of injustice in 1320 would have been viewed as a potentially fruitful diplomatic approach.
The Declaration described no sudden swelling of nationalist feeling, but rather a desire for respect and autonomy within the existing relationship with England.
It was a diplomatic letter and a piece of what might be called intelligent propaganda.
A 1320 copy of the original resides at the National Archives of Scotland in Edinburgh.
The Declaration of Arbroath laid out the Scots’ historic national credentials and essentially asked the pope to compel the English to leave them alone.
However, there is no evidence that the letter had any significant impact at the time.
It disappeared from history and was virtually forgotten even in Scotland until an English translation of the original Latin appeared in 1689.
TomorrowsWorld.org For Freedom Alone The most famous quote from the letter, sometimes used by Scottish nationalists, reads, “As long as a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be subjected to the lordship of the English.
The SNP had sought to avoid Brexit and wants another Independence Referendum in Scotland (referred to as “IndyRef2”), seeking to separate Scotland from the other UK countries of England, Wales, and Northern lreland.
If the Declaration of Arbroath were a declaration of Scottish independence, you could see why the SNP might use it.
The party has, however, shied away from referencing the Declaration or even drawing attention to the phrase about freedom, as such references have proved problematic in their earlier campaigns.
Despite the encouraging results for the SNP cause in Scotland, reflected in the recent general election, a constitutional standoff may not be on the cards.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already declared that he will not support an IndyRef2, as the first one in 2014 was supposed to settle the issue for at least a generation.
The preamble makes a clear statement about the Scots’ knowledge of their Israelite origins, their ancient migrations, their victories in battle, and their long history of self-governance as a nation. ..we know and from the chronicles and books of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the Scots, has been graced with widespread renown.
Thence it came, twelve hundred years after the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea, to its home in the west where it still lives today.
The Britons it first drove out, the Picts it utterly destroyed, and, even though very often assailed by the Norwegians, the Danes and the English, it took possession of that home with many victories and untold efforts; and, as the histories of old time bear witness, they have held it free of all servitude ever since.
In their kingdom there have reigned one hundred and thirteen kings of their own royal stock, the line unbroken by a single foreigner.
Our booklet The United States and Great Britain in Prophecy, available free of charge in print and online, describes biblically prophesied situations like this potential disintegration of long-established, powerful alliances.
Leviticus 26 records God's warning to the Israelites against disobeying Him, a state we see plainly in our society today.
He declares specifically in verse 19 that He will break the pride of our power in response to our national rejection of Him.
We know Jacob's name was changed to Israel , which—as demonstrated in our booklet—refers to the nations of northwestern Europe today, including the Scots, English, Welsh, and Northern Irish.
It seems that the general election vote in Scotland was not necessarily for Scottish independence but rather was against Brexit.
However, with Brexit now a fact of history, it remains to be seen how the dynamics will change.
After nearly 50 years, the UK intends to control once again its own national destiny, which may be to the advantage of Scotland as well.
We knew that our moral values and legal systems owed much to the Bible, and the language of faith was all around us in public and in private.
At the same time, we are Seeing an increase in the number of people who profess no religious affiliation at all.
Where the mainline Protestant denominations once set the tone for the U.S., the rise of the non-religious has changed that.
Americans claiming “no religion”—sometimes referred to as “nones” because of how they answer the question “what is your religious tradition?” — now represent about 23. percent of the population, up from 21. percent in 2016.
When Time magazine published its famous April 1966 cover asking “Is God Dead?,” it was hardly the first to raise the question or to propose an answer.
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche had boldly asserted more than 80 years earlier, “God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown.
Even in our Western world, atheism became increasingly fashionable in the twentieth century, as people came to believe that science, not God, would provide their real salvation.
In recent decades, however, science itself has made amazing new strides in understanding our world—and many of the new understandings support, or even demand, the existence of an intelligent designer, and a human spirit as something more than a product of biological and chemical processes.
For a hundred years after biologist Charles Darwin published his On the Origin of Species in 1859, the scientific community became increasingly influenced flora and fauna.
In 1855, he formulated his own theory of natural selection, and sent to Darwin a short paper on the topic.
Wallace, however, looking at the same biological questions Darwin considered, came to a different conclusion.
To illustrate his perspective, Wallace IF WE SAW PEOPLE MAKING THINGS BUT weivvtcotinest the construction ots, being looking at the construction of a DENIED THE INTELLIGENT WORK OF THE PEOPLE AND STUDIED ONLY THE THINGS, OTHERS WOULD THINK United States FOOLISH by his theory of natural selection.
Darwin himself acknowledged that his theory did not account for some natural phenomena that seemed too complex to arise through the incremental mutations and selections his theory required, but he was confident that these complexities would eventually be explained.
Since then, scientists seeking to affirm Darwin’s theory have indeed proposed evolutionary explanations for many complex structures.
Their explanations, however, like so much of evolutionary theory, are stuck in the realm of theory, neither reproducible nor falsifiable, and thus are more akin to philosophy than real science.
Where Darwin is famous for his trip to the Galapagos Islands, Wallace spent eight years in what we now call Indonesia, observing 20 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 mansion, bridge, or railway, but seeing only the movement of materials and not the builders.
If we saw people making things but denied the intelligent work of the people and studied only the things, others would think us foolish.
Biochemist Michael Behe has observed that the science of Darwin’s day had no understanding of the molecular foundation of life.
The late astronomer Fred Hoyle is famous for one illustration of the improbability of natural selection without intelligent design.
He observed that a yeast cell anda jumbo jet have approximately the same number of parts.
Yet no one would seriously propose that a jumbo jet could spontaneously evolve from its parts.
Some propose a “multiverse,” in which our universe exists alongside countless other universes, most of which do not support life as ours does.
Most viewed it as a fringe idea, perhaps an interesting intellectual exercise, but certainly not a serious alternative worldview.
Put briefly, Bostrom proposed that unless most human-level civilizations become extinct before they are advanced enough to create computer simulations of persons, or they become advanced but have no interest in running such simulations, the vast majority of those experiencing personhood are doing so as part of acomputer simulation.
Neither does he eliminate the need for such a Creator; he merely pushes it away by a step.
Simulations aside, the principle of biogenesis—validated by all experiments and experience throughout the history of mankind—states that life can only come from life.
Scientists know there are intricate mathematical laws that determine the motion and expansion of the universe.
Scientist Patrick Glynn writes that everything had to be “just right’ from the very start—everything from the values of fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity, to the relative masses of the various subatomic particles, to things like the number of neutrino types at time 1 second, which the universe has to ‘know’ already at 10° second.
Yes, the laws of physics existed from the very beginning of the universe.
Mathematically, it is far beyond improbable that such a universe would randomly come into existence with just the right properties to allow human existence.
Many scientists, trapped by the philosophy of materialism and determined to come up with explanations that exclude divine creation, have invented fanciful theories to explain the complexity around us.
By contrast, intelligent-design theorists point to the “irreducible complexity” of many living structures and processes as evidence that they could not have come about by random mutation and natural selection.
Evolutionists have offered rebuttals to claims of irreducible complexity in nature, but even the most creative biologist cannot avoid the reality of mathematics.
Evolutionists sometimes accuse creationists of offering a “God of the gaps” explanation—attributing to an omnipotent God any phenomena that are not yet understood by science.
The Mystery of Consciousness Materialist evolutionists, faced with the phenomenon of human consciousness, find many of their assumptions challenged.
We’re doing pretty well in physics, even though we have some puzzling areas, like quantum mechanics.
The philosophy called solipsism proposes that the only reality is in your mind, and that nothing else truly exists.
One way, as scientists like Wallace and Behe have proposed, is to look for signs that another mind has acted.
It’s not the things around us that convince us of others’ intelligence, but the purposeful arrangement of things.
The idea that the world around us provides evidence of intelligent design did not originate with sci22 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 entists like Wallace and Behe.
Materialist scientists may think that their minds are illusions, mere byproducts of the “meat” of which their bodies are made.
Though animal instinct is an amazing mechanism that lets animals do many incredible things, they cannot think on the human level.
The qualitative difference between human mind and animal brain is enormous.
Animal instinct is often remarkable, but only human beings can conceive of multiple physical dimensions beyond the visible.
Physicists use massive instruments such as the Large Hadron Collider to understand physical dimensions beyond our view.
Evolution cannot explain, and often even denies, the existence of spirit—even though the greatest reality is not material existence, but the existence of spirit.
Scientists make many wonderful discoveries, but their tools can take them only so far.
If God has not opened their minds to understand the things of the Spirit, they cannot spiritually discern the full reality of what He is doing here on the earth.
God’s Spiritual Creation Many who puzzle over the physical creation of the universe are missing out on the most astounding aspect of God’s creation.
His very own holy and righteous character, which becomes the character of humble, yielded, genuine Christians.
Not only has God created finely tuned physical law to form the universe, He has given spiritual law to form the character of Christians.
Jesus gave the two “great commandments” in Matthew 22:36-39, which magnify the Ten Commandments given in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5.
These spiritual laws are just as real as the physical laws that govern the universe.

Yes, it is good to understand the logical and philosophical points we have considered briefly in this article—properly used, reason and logic are not the enemies of faith.
Yet we have seen that much modern “science” hardly deserves that name, as it does not offer us reproducible experiments that can prove or disprove theories such as evolution and intelligent design.
However, you can perform one vital experiment on your own and examine the results personally.
You can prove God’s existence by living the way of life He has revealed through the Bible and through the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
And so, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to give us an example of godly life and character, and to save us from our sinful nature.
The truth, however, is that you and I were created for a great purpose.
THE REAL GOD March-April 2020 | Tomorrow's World 23 Works OF HIS HANDS The Brainless Genius of the Sponge ost of us think of sponges as everyday household items.
Their softness and absorbency make them versatile tools for cleaning our bodies, floors, and dishes, and for applying paint to our walls.
Although the sponges we use today are likely to be made of synthetic materials, for most of human history we harvested our sponges from the oceans—the dried bodies of aquatic invertebrates.
Sponges can be found in marine environments throughout the world, from lakes and rivers to vast oceans, and from warm tropical climates to icy polar regions.
They come in various shapes and sizes, with astoundingly vivid colors and intricate structural architecture.
The underwater equivalent of flowers, their beauty is truly breathtaking.
Remarkable Structure Unlike most animals, sponges have no external or internal organs or muscles.
Sponges rely on cellular specialization to perform the functions necessary for life.
Others have a more rigid, yet highly flexible, skeletal frame that can withstand powerful ocean currents.
Cells called sclerocytes secrete calcite or silica strands of varying lengths to form these deceptively delicate 24 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 architectural wonders.
Choanocytes have a funnel-like collar covered with sticky hairs, surrounding a central flagellum.
A sponge’s outer layer contains many tiny pores, which connect to the inner layer to form a complex network of channels through the mesohyl.
The flagella of the choanocytes move back and forth in unison, directing the flow of water through the network of canals.
The sticky hairs of the choanocytes capture particles of organic matter carried in the water, and mobile amebocyte cells engulf and transport these captured bits to other cells within the sponge.
Incredible Cleaning Power The filter feeding of sponges has a positive impact on the water quality of marine ecosystems.
As they feed, sponges clean the water by removing harmful bacteria, pesticides, and in some cases, even heavy metals such as tin and lead.
The sponge stores within itself anything removed from the water that is not consumable as food.
When they separate the individual cells of a live sponge, they find that the cells will reassemble to form one or more smaller sponges.
The disassociated cells of a sponge can aggregate and reconstruct its entire body.
Sponge cells do not require an assembly order, so a sponge can rapidly regenerate if forcibly separated.
If two different species of sponge are put through a sieve together, the separated cells will sort themselves and combine only with other cells of the same species.
Given a food-rich environment, individual sponge cells could survive simply by reverting to an amoeba-like THE BRAINLESS GENIUS OF THE SPONGE state.
As they reconstruct the original animal, the cells of these simple animals display knowledge, intent, and the ability to identify other cells as part of the original larger sponge.
Amazingly, sponges do this without an apparent means of communication, and despite having neither a brain nor a central nervous system.
And scientists do not fully understand the mechanism by which sponges accomplish all of this.
Carried somehow within each cell of this “simple” creature are the necessary blueprints and instructions—including knowledge of all the specialized cells and cellular functions required for life—to work with other cells and build another complete sponge.
Astounding as this is, there is even more to the sponge’s amazing ability to regenerate.
Sponge cells— sclerocytes, pinacocytes, choanocytes, amebocytes, and other cells of a sponge—are all totipotent.
That is, each sponge cell is similar to a stem cell, able to become a different kind of cell.
When strong currents damage it, or a hungry fish bites it, or a part of it is harvested for a bath scrub, the sponge can heal itself—because any cell near the damaged area can take on the cellular specialization of the injured or missing cells.
Their form and structure, their ability to clean their ecosystem, and their miraculous ability to regenerate attest to a complexity far beyond human understanding.
These fantastic creatures are ideally suited to their environment and their role.
The ingenious perfection on display in the sea sponge cannot be the result of mere chance.
It is evidence of a Creator who has planned, designed, and built everything needed to sustain life on this planet.
The earth is full of Your possessions—this great and wide sea, in which are innumerable teeming things, living things both small and great” . —Gary Molnar March-April 2020 | Tomorrow's World 25 FUN AND FULFILLMENT We all need play.
But we all need more than play, too. cousin of mine has been very successful in several business ventures.
He has worked hard over many years and has accumulated wealth and property.
He has the accoutrements of luxury that one might expect, in the form of homes, cars, boats, an airplane, and a farm in the country.
This cousin has traveled extensively in pursuit of his interests and passions.
Along the way, his family has fallen apart and he has experienced a lot of heartache and pain.
His “success” has not brought him the peace of mind and satisfaction that he thought it would.
When I see this relative, now infrequently, he always asks me the same question.
You see, after a lifetime of toil, he doesn’t find much pleasure or joy in his pursuits.
He is still looking for that elusive something to fill the void in his life—and he is not alone.
The movie industry is burgeoning with more film releases every year, which generates huge profits for the producers as people fill the theaters to be entertained and to lose themselves for a little while ina make-believe world.
Finding Balance It is certainly not wrong to enjoy playing a game or watching a good movie, as long as we do so in balance and do not become distracted from the basic things that bring a happy life.
As human beings, we should find time to play, to enjoy something that brings us delight and pleasure— but always in moderation and never at the expense of others.
If some item or activity breaks one of the Ten Commandments or ridicules godly principles, it simply is neither fun nor funny.
If an activity is healthy, such as physical exercise, or if it challenges you inREQUEST YOUR FREE BOOKLET Your Ultimate Destiny 26 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 tellectually, increasing your knowledge of something worthwhile, then it is uplifting and beneficial.
There is a gnawing emptiness within all human beings that cannot be filled with physical things or pastimes, though many people try to assuage the feeling with work, “stuff,” or leisure activities.
No Substitute For the young and the old alike, play is important in developing the balanced life our Creator would want us to have.
So, whether they are board games or video games, stage productions or As human novels, symphony concerts or beings, we movies, athletic games or walks should find in the park, such activities P help us maintain a wholesome time to play, balance in our lives.
As our article on page 12 of this issue explains, there are many things that we can do that will contribute to our sense of happiness and satisfaction.
But, as the same article notes, one of the best ways to find happiness is to stop pursuing it and to embrace a larger purpose for our lives.
Wy Ee ' ¢ & the death of one-third of the earth’s population, this is still not the biblical Armageddon described in Revelation 16:13-16.
What we see in Scripture is that all-out, no-holds-barred war will occur in our nottoo-distant future.
My generation and those on either side of it lived under the shadow of a mushroom cloud—some of us more than others.
As children of military families, growing up on United States Strategic Air Command bases, my friends and I understood that we were at ground zero if war should break out.
However, while we cannot deny that there will be difficult days ahead, the Bible warns us all that most of us have far greater concerns than nuclear Armageddon.
Comfort and Peace It might surprise you that Bible prophecy was actually a comfort for me and for many others in those dangerous times.
Yes, it was a tense time of crisis, when one mistake could have blown the world apart.
But the Bible told me—and others blessed to be able to understand—that it wasn’t God’s time or place for such a catastrophe.
Today, too, despite some awful prophesied events on the horizon, those who zealously look to God can have peace and comfort.
Your Bible reveals much about the end-time, and we at Tomorrow’s World offer many free resources that can help you understand what the Bible reveals.
We will encounter twists and turns as history unfolds, but we really can know the overall picture.
Most importantly, we need to know why we were born in the first place—what God’s plan is for us.
We human beings are far more resilient than we sometimes think, but far more fragile in the overall picture.
However, there is a God, and He gives us the opportunity to live forever.
He is evaluating the decisions we make—whether we love Him with all our heart, mind, and being, or whether we follow the crowd and fear man more than God.
How amazing it is that so few spend any time searching to prove whether God is real, that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him, and what His purpose is for us.
It seems that most are more interested in what is on television tonight, or whether “their team” will win the game this weekend.
And, if understanding the purpose of life is important to you, request our resource Your Ultimate Destiny, as well.

Though you might have been able to ignore the locker-room odor wafting from the heap, your mother's highly sensitive sense of smell vectored in on the offending collection of sweaty socks and t-shirts.
Or maybe you recall when you had a group of friends over to watch a movie and thought nothing of leaving the living room strewn with empty cups and remnants of popcorn and potato chips, assuming someone else would take care of it.
A worn-down, frustrated parent can begin to feel like a mindless recording, repeating the same words again and again toa child.
And the child can seem not to care or understand why it matters that the toys, dishes, or dirty socks are picked up, washed, or put away.
The lessons children learn when we continue to insist and expect that they “clean up their mess” will find application in many other areas of their lives.
A Sense of Responsibility For example, teaching children to “clean up their mess” fosters a sense of responsibility.
In Genesis, God introduced Adam and Eve to their home in the garden of Eden.
But responsibility is not only a matter of taking care of what is ours.
It also means ensuring that what is ours doesn’t make life worse for people around us.
But we also teach her not to leave her doll in the middle of the hallway where people walk, where they might trip over it and fall.
We teach her that it is she who must put her doll away when she’s done playing with it.
Israelite houses at that time were commonly built with a rooftop area to enjoy the coolness of the evening.
So, to ensure that no one could accidentally fall off the roof, the owner was required to build a parapet, or low wall, to protect those TomorrowsWorld.org who were up there.
Our belongings—whether house, or car, or anything else—are a blessing to us, but we have a responsibility to ensure that our possessions don't cause harm to other people.
God told the Israelites to take responsibility for keeping the camp clean and sanitary by burying their excrement.
This not only honored Him, but also prevented the spread of disease and showed courtesy and respect toward one’s neighbors.
God taught the Israelites to take responsibility and clean up after themselves.
REQUEST YOUR FREE BOOKLET fc An Understanding of Cause and Effect Another lesson that is learned when we teach our children to clean up after themselves is the lesson of consequences, or cause and effect.
If you they doordon’t — kindle a fire, you must take responsibility for it.
If the do matters to th d fire you started flares out of ose aroun control, it could potentially dethem.
Your decision to graze animals on your own property could cause damage to aneighbor’s field if your animals escape the confines of your property.
When we ask our children to wash the dishes they have dirtied, we have a reason.
If our children leave schoolbooks strewn across the kitchen table, someone else must tidy the table before the next meal.
Children need to learn that what they do or don’t do matters to those around them.
Though these examples may seem trivial, they teach a lesson that will become invaluable as they go through life.
Helping children learn to “clean up their mess” is a powerful way to set them on a track to becoming mature adults, teaching them to be accountable for the things that are theirs.
This is a stepping-stone to understanding that their actions and even their words are their responsibility.
How Practicing Gratitude Can Help Make You Happier, psychologist Robert Emmons writes about the benefit of purposefully and consciously cultivating gratitude.
Emmons notes that “while the emotion seemed simplistic even to me as I began my research, I soon discovered that gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness.
This involves the thanksgiving of our previous step, but also more than that.
Emmons found that these life changes were not just illusory, but were confirmed by the testimonies of these individuals’ spouses, friends, and families.
In his research, Emmons defined gratitude as acknowledging goodness in our lives and acknowledging the source of that goodness to be outside ourselves— that is, gratitude must be directed toward someone else.
And he found it all the more important that we practice gratitude for our blessings in times of trial and difficulty, when those blessings may seem hardest to find.
Let God Know None of us can pretend that we do not go through hard times.
Of course, we must trust God’s response to our worries, believing that He has the wisdom to see what we do not and the power to act however He must.
As we thank Him, praise Him for who He is, and cast our cares upon Him, we are to humble ourselves as He gives us His peace, as we remain confident that He will deliver us in His way, in His time.
The Bible is full of wonderful promises for those who seek the Creator God and His Son, our Savior, and whose priority in life is His coming Kingdom.
They concern health and security for us and TomorrowsWorld.org our loved ones, yes, but so much more besides.
In fact, the Bible contains so many promises that we could scarcely scratch the surface of them in the short space of this article.
You may want to read Richard F Ames’ inspiring article “Surviving—and Thriving—in Times of Stress” from our SeptemberOctober 2019 issue, available at Tomorrows World.org.
We know how comforting it feels to have confidence in a parent or spouse who makes and keeps wonderful promises.
How much more we should feel grateful that the God of the universe, who has no human failings that may disappoint us, has made promises that He can ensure will come to pass.
Embrace a Purpose Greater than Yourself In their pursuit of happiness, many never discover the vital truth that happiness cannot be, in and of itself, our goal.
Cheap and temporary happiness can be ours easily, but the more we directly seek deep happiness, the more we cannot find it.
Something deep within us wants to know that we are connected to something larger than ourselves.
There is a happiness in that connection that isn’t available to us any other way.
Of course, there is no greater effort than to contribute to Jesus Christ’s own effort to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to the world.
That effort gave the Apostle Paul a sense of satisfaction and purpose that carried him through terrible times of suffering and uncertainty.
Even when imprisoned and in danger of losing his life, Paul possessed such a steadfast peace and a passionate joy that, on trial before King Agrippa, in chains and surrounded by accusers, he chose not to defend himself but instead to preach the Gospel.
Yes, even imprisoned and in chains, Paul wished he could share with Agrippa—and all men and women —the joy, confidence, and happiness he had found in knowing His purpose and contributing to God’s Work in the world, sharing the glorious truth of God’s coming Kingdom.
When we devote ourselves to service in pursuit of those larger goals, happiness comes naturally, and far more deeply than when we seek it directly as an end unto itself.
If you do, you will be on the way to happiness as you have never known it before—for now and for eternity.
The police were outnumbered, outgunned, and wore subpar protective gear.
Police in Mexico report being critically under-equipped and feeling as if they do not stand a chance against the better-armed and better-financed drug cartels.
Police officers in Mexico are also notorious for making direct alliances with drug cartels.
Many criticize Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador’s new law enforcement policy of “hugs 32 Tomorrow's World | not bullets,” while the people of the nation wait for justice.
This same sad story of widespread corruption and violence Is becoming commonplace in many countries around the world.
Increasingly, shifting international norms are reflected in these prophecies—and the situation in Mexico calls such prophecies to mind.
In addition, significantly fewer March-April 2020 attend church services regularly.
At the same time, more Americans label themselves as spiritual but not religious, and the percentage of the “religiously unaffiliated” has significantly increased.
America’s continuing religious decline— especially among once-professing Christians—is real, and it fits well with end-time prophecies.
Their retirement means that any decisions made by the WTO that are appealed will have only one of the required three judges to hear the appeal.
The United ROWS NEWS & PROPHECY Weekly Report SUE SVC eis OG —_— ——_— —T TOMORROW SWORLD.ORG/ CONNECT/SUBSCRIBE-TO-E-ZINE TomorrowsWorld.org NEWSWATCH States is currently blocking the WTO from appointing new judges because It claims the organization practices “judicial overreach’—an opinion shared by 58 percent of those recently involved with WTO disputes.
By blocking the replacement of the retiring judges, the United States has rendered the appellate body useless, after roughly 24 years of regulating global trade.
Experts suggest that “global trade is about to become a lot less predictable and a lot more contentious.
Life Expectancy Falling with United States Health Decline Public health experts are concerned.
Factors driving the rising death rates in America include suicide, drug addiction and overdose , obesity, alcohol-related liver disease, and numerous other causes.
The fact that America has one of the world’s highest standards of living and also arguably one of the most advanced health care systems in the world also makes these trends very disturbing.
As we watch the deterioration of the United States and many other Israelite-descended nations, it iS important to remember that this moral, physical, economic, and military decline is proceeding hand-in-hand with the continued rejection of God and His laws.
Itallans are fed up with the lack of economic recovery following the 2008 global recession, as well as with ongoing governmental failures.
Most of Italy's governments last just over a year, adding to the ongoing instability, and many are ready for a major change.
Far-right groups continue to gain ground in Italy as a growing percentage of the populace loses faith in the government.
Among the poorer and less educated, over two-thirds are in favor of a powerful leader who can essentially operate above the law.
Many just want the government to provide Stability and certainty in their futures—and they seem not to care how it happens.
This extreme frustration with government enables dictators to rise to power with the support of their people.
