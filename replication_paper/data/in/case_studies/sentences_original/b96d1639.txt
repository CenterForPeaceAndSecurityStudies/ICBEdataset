For 13 days in October 1962 the world appeared to stand on the brink of nuclear war.BackgroundCuba is an island just 90 miles off the coast of Florida.
Until 1959, it was closely allied to the United States under the leadership of the right-wing dictator, General Batista.
There was considerable American investment in Cuba and the USA was the chief consumer of Cuba’s sugar and tobacco.Fidel Castro and Nikita Krushchev in the hall at the United Nations general meeting in September 1960In 1959 Batista was overthrown in a revolution led by Fidel Castro.
One of Castro’s first moves was to go to the USA to secure support for his new state, but President Eisenhower refused to speak with him.
Castro had not been a communist before 1960, but was drawn to communism by the friendship and support offered by Khrushchev and his government.
Castro nationalised all American-owned companies in Cuba, and refused to pay compensation.
The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuban goods, depriving Cubans of a market for their sugar and tobacco and the income to import oil and other essential goods.curriculum-key-factImportant: This backfired badly on the Americans as it meant the Cubans then looked to the USSR for a market for their sugar.
In April 1961, just after he was installed as President of the USA, John F Kennedy approved a plan to invade Cuba and overthrow communism.
The CIA landed 1,400 Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Cuba with the aim of provoking an anti-communist uprising.
Almost at the last minute, Kennedy cancelled an order that had promised the Cuban resistance United States Air Force support for their coup d’etat.
The lack of air support meant the rebels were easily defeated when they were met by 20,000 heavily armed Cuban troops.
Keep this in mind when thinking about the missile crisis it makes him much less likely to back down in future.A group of Cubans captured by Catro's soldiers after attempting to invade at the Bay of PigsDiscovery of the missilesOn 14 October 1962, an American spy plane flying over Cuba took pictures that showed the construction of Soviet missile launch sites.
Advisors known as ‘Hawks’ on both sides advised aggression, and in the USA some believed they would have a good chance of winning.
OctoberKennedy receives a letter from Khrushchev saying that the Soviet ships will not stop at the blockade, but will force their way through.
OctoberDespite Khrushchev’s ‘tough talk', the twenty ships approaching the blockade turn back .25 OctoberUS spy planes report increased building work at the missile launch sites on Cuba.
OctoberKennedy receives a letter from Khrushchev promising to remove the launch sites if the USA agrees to lift the blockade and promises not to invade Cuba.
OctoberA second letter from Khrushchev says the launch sites will only be removed if the United States removes its missiles in Turkey.
Kennedy opts to answer only the first telegram while privately offering to consider the removal of missiles from Turkey.
Khrushchev had saved the communist regime in Cuba from invasion by the USA, and had negotiated a deal with the USA on the removal of their Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
Kennedy had kept his election promise and stood up to the USSR, and kept nuclear missiles out of Cuba.In order to ensure easier communication between Washington DC and Moscow in the event of future conflict, a hotline was installed giving a direct phone link between the White House and the Kremlin.Both the USA and the USSR realised they had been on the brink of nuclear war and entered into talks.
These talks eventually led to the 1963 Test Ban Treaty which began the process of ending the testing of nuclear weapons.In the long term, the crisis may have created a willingness on both sides to enter into the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks later in the 1960s.
