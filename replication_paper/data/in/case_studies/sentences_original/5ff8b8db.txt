While Allison's work has received considerable critical attention, there has been surprisingly little examination of the content and internal logic of his models.
We subject each of Allison's three models to a systematic critical analysis.

These are, I think, Crisis , is a landmark in our discipline's analysis of bureaucracy's role in foreign policy making.
Prior among the important benefits to be derived from explicit theory construction, and Allison's example is therefore to Allison's work, most studies of bureaucracy and one well worth taking seriously, foreign policy, though rich and informative, were largely descriptive and rather unfocused theoretically.
They seldom presented an explicit analytical As predicted in the reviews, Allison's approach has perspective, and readers were often left to infer what indeed had a substantial impact on both the study the authors believed were the fundamental properand the teaching of bureaucracy.
His three models ties of bureaucratic policymaking. have been widely applied, and other scholars have followed his lead by developing additional models to Allison's work demonstrated that a more selfaccount for aspects of policymaking left unexplained consciously theoretical approach to the study of bureaucracy and foreign policy was both feasible and by Allison's analyses.
The earlier literature had rarely developed still widely used in courses on bureaucracy, public alternative explanations for events and decisions.
We have in formulating his three models—the rational actor, frequently used it in our own classes; one of us organizational process, and governmental politics models, is alone responsible for the sale of sevlabeled I, II, and III, respectively—Allison showed eral hundred copies to students in the past 15 years. how to make explicit the explanations of events that As Holsti's review suggested, the book is so useful had only been implicit in many of these earlier because it shows students how to formulate and studies.
Indeed, for courses dealing with bureaucmore scientific foundation. racy and foreign policy there are few alternatives to Allison's work received high praise in reviews by a Essence of Decision.
Even those praising the book (e.g., main problems of the study of international politics.
Its Holsti 1972; Rourke 1972; and Wagner 1974) also general appeal is primarily due to the effectiveness of expressed reservations.
However, none of these early Allison's theoretical arguments in his analysis of the criticisms comprehensively examined the internal Cuban missile crisis, which contains a number of striking logic of all three of Allison's models, and it is preinsights and some information that no one else had cisely the logical structure of his work that is particthought to look for.

It is now clear that of Allison's reflections on the theoretical literature menalternative versions of Allison's models could and tioned, they seem to be the product of his efforts to make should be developed to highlight somewhat more these three paradigms as explicit as possible, enabling fundamental factors in policymaking.
If Before plunging into a detailed analysis of Allison's one cannot determine what is driving a model, its three models, it is advisable to distinguish one from explanatory power cannot be accurately assessed. another by denning their key properties.
As several Second, the hypotheses drawn from a model should, early critics of Allison's work noted, however, this is ideally, be logically derived from the initial assumpmore difficult than one might think (see,g., Corntions.

Very different models—and very foreign policy making, have often used Essence of different understandings of policymaking—follow Decision as an introduction and guide to these literafrom different assumptions here.

If a central goal of We should emphasize that our general purpose Essence of Decision is to understand the relative virtues here is to examine the theoretical aspects of Allison's of government-as-single-actor versus government-asmultiple-actors models, the results of the comparison work.

Even in the context of goal consensus We can see at the outset, then, that our simple and perfect rationality (i.e., each agent, like a perfect typology raises some serious questions about just Bayesian statistician, extracts the maximal amount of what is driving each of Allison's models.
We do information from each noisy observation), there rebelieve that Allison's initial instincts were on the right main structural issues of who should communicate track.
If we make the problem dynamic several different classes of models, and it is an essen(e.g., involving optimal adaptation to a changing tial enterprise to assess the relative explanatory and environment), the complexities multiply—even for interpretative power of models in each of these actors with the same goals.

For this reason, Allison's subsequent The heart of Model III is multiple decision makers enterprise of combining Models II and III into one with conflicting goals—hence the third line of the overarching bureaucratic politics model (see Allison typology.

We conIndeed, in chapter 1 Allison persistently blurs the sider three of these. distinction between decision theory and game theory.

This can happen not only in a theory, the rational decision problem is reduced to a subjective sense (both parties prefer the whole loaf to simple matter of selecting among a set of given the half each agreed to take) but in a stronger, alternatives, each of which has a given set of conseobjective sense.

The Nonetheless, we have some reservations about his notion that simple rules generate simple behavior is analysis.
In itself, this assumption is consistent with much of the writing of Varying, and Possibly Stochastic, Inputs.

When executive branch conflict does occur, and some pointed out that Model Ill's ambiguities understanding its causes requires that we distinguish raise questions about its status as a model, few critics between differences over goals and differences over made an argument about Model III that we think is beliefs about how to achieve the goals.
