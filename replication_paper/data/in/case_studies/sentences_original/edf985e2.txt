On October 14, 1962, a U2 spy plane captured photographs that sparked the beginning of the crisis.
Three days later, on October 17, 1962, more than 40 United States warships headed to Vieques, off the coast of Puerto Rico, for training exercises.
The Joint Chiefs had been planning scenarios for an amphibious assault on Cuba for months, but President Kennedy, still smarting from placing his trust in the military leaders during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, was reticent to pursue military action.
Bill Ober Dobbs is also the author of One Minute to Midnight, a tick-tock history of the crisis.
Almost a week into the events, shortly after Kennedy addressed the country in a televised speech, the President cancelled the training on Vieques as the military advanced to DEFCON 2.
The plan was for the Marines to attack east of Havana, at Tarara , while the 1st Armored Division landed through the port of Mariel to the west.
In the meantime, the 101st and 82nd Airborne divisions would conduct a paratroop assault behind enemy lines.
In its initial sweep, the invading force would skirt Havana and head directly for the missile sites.
The Marines were prepared for five hundred dead the first day alone –mainly on Tarara beach — and a further two thousand injured.
Total casualties during the first ten days of fighting were estimated at over eighteen thousand, including four thousand dead.
The naval quarantine of Cuba was successful and Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev negotiated a gradual stand-down, with the Soviet Union pulling their missiles out of Cuba and the United States eventually removing theirs from Turkey.
