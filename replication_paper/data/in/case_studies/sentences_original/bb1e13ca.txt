In October 1962, a United States spy plane captured evidence of the Soviet Union moving nuclear weapons into Cuba which lies 90 miles off the coast of Florida.
Upon hearing this news, President Kennedy had to made plans within 7 days in secret, before word of this potential international issue was released to the public.
President Kennedy met with his most trusted advisors, including his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to create a plan of action.
President Kennedy announced to the world that they had discovered nuclear missiles were being transported to Cuba.
The U.S plan of action was to impose a naval blockade to prevent further shipments to Cuba.
While the blockade was successful in stopping additional nuclear weapons from entering Cuba, the missiles already in Cuba were in the beginning stages of becoming operational.
Kennedy, however, choose to reject both options and proposed a policy that the U.S would not invade Cuba, if the Soviet Union removed all nuclear weapons from Cuba.
Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to this deal, partly due to a secret clause that the United States would also remove U.S missiles from Turkey within 6 months of the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.
