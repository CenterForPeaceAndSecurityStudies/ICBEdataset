This account draws on Sergo’s personal experiences, his father’s reminiscences, and Soviet documentation such as his father’s cables from Havana; memoranda of conversations with Castro, John F Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and UN Secretary-General U Thant; and notes on internal Kremlin deliberations.Sergo A Mikoyan was a historian specializing in Latin America and Soviet–Latin American relations, editor of Latinskaya Amerika, and chief researcher at the Center of Peace Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.
Plenty, it turns out, in this remarkably revealing book by the son of Nikita Khrushchev’s main Kremlin ally and chief negotiator with Washington and Havana.
