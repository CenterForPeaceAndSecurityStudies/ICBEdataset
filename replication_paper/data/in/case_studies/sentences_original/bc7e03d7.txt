John F Kennedy Date:1962 Annotation: In the Spring of 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sought to fundamentally alter the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union by secretly installing offensive nuclear missiles on Cuba, ninety miles off the United States coast.
However, on October 15, 1962, aerial photographs by a U-2 spy plane identified the missiles before they could be deployed.
Earlier in the year, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had assured the president that the Soviet Union would provide Cuba only with defensive missiles.
Not only were the Soviets installing missiles on Cuba capable of hitting the northern United States, it also was providing Cuba with tactical nuclear weapons to halt a United States invasion.
On October 22, 1962, President John F Kennedy took to the airwaves to tell Americans that the Soviet Union was installing offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba.
Kennedyâ€™s goal was to convince the Soviet Union to withdraw the weapons without having to use force.
He also positioned United States troops in Florida to prepare for the possible invasion of the island and kept a quarter of the United States B-52 bombers airborne for nearly two weeks.
Kennedy also sought to offer the Soviet Union fig leaves to allow it to back down without losing face.
He pledged not to invade Cuba and also secretly agreed to remove 15 Jupiter medium-range missiles from Turkey.
The White House October 22, 1962 Good evening, my fellow citizens: This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba.
