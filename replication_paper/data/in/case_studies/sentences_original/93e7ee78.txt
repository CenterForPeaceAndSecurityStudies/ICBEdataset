American warships and Soviet submarines with nuclear-tipped torpedoes played out a tense high-seas standoff.American spy planes had spotted Soviet missiles – capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads and only a few minutes flight time from incinerating United States cities – being deployed in Cuba.
Hawks in Congress and close to the president called for immediate air strikes.As the days of excruciating tension played out in October, 1962, the world lurched closer and closer to nuclear war.
Both President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev publicly bluffed and threatened; both feared the war would start by accident; both fought off hawks inside their own inner circles; both ultimately backed down.Never before, or since, has the spectre of thousands of mushroom clouds rising cratered cities and spewing deadly plumes of radioactivity sufficient to send man back to the stone age – or perhaps extinction – been so terrifyingly close.
In the historical record, U Thant has largely been written out of the crisis,"" says Walter Dorn, who heads the Security and International Affairs department at Canadian Forces College, in Toronto.
The Kennedy camp preferred to portray their man as a gutsy Cold Warrior, not a President so unnerved by the hawks in his own camp that he sought mediation by the UN.Yet at one critical juncture, American diplomats woke U Thant at midnight and begged him to deliver a face-saving solution to the Russians.
Hardly anybody know about what U Thant did … but at one point there were separate teams on the 38th floor of the UN building – a United States team and a Soviet team – and U Thant was literally shuttling between the two rooms,"" Mr Dorn said in an interview.In his paper, just published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Mr Dorn contrasts the bombastic swaggering in the early American versions of the crisis, with the reality of quiet diplomacy.
U Thant went to Havana, brought back the body of the downed American pilot, calmed Fidel Castro and – months later – after it was all over, was quietly thanked by both Mr Kennedy and Mr Khrushchev.There's even a minor Canadian postscript among the tales untold.
While Canadian military historians tend to portray the crisis as a military showdown and focus on efforts of Canadian warships in hunting Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, there was also a little-known UN aspect to Canada's involvement.Near the end of the crisis, Ottawa offered to paint white some of Canada's Voodoo fighter-bombers, put UN markings on them and provide them to verify that the Soviets had made good on their promise to pull missiles from Cuba.

Welch said.As the full truth has slowly emerged about the October, 1962, crisis, the reality is that it wasn't cold-eyed brinksmanship that averted war, nor a secret deal in which Soviet missiles would be moved from Cuba while American ones would be taken out of Turkey.
Kennedy thought he had Castro and the Cubans under control, but he didn't.
And Khrushchev thought he had Castro, under control, but, as he would learn to his horror, he didn't.
Given his belief in the inevitability of a United States invasion, Castro's focus on Armageddon is not a nightmare, but a kind of dream.

Mr Castro emerges as a nightmare, for both the United States and Soviet leaders.For Mr Kennedy, dogged by the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion the previous year, looking weak in the face of Communist expansion represents the gravest danger to his presidency.
