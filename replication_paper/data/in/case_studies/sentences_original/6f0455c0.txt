In the 18th century, virtually all of the Baluchi tribes were united in a loose confederacy under the banner of Mir Adbullah Khan of Kalat.
Pakistan also inherited the problems of the region, with the fiercely independent and warlike Balichi tribes resisting integration into the new political state.
LOCATION AND HOMELAND Baltichi speakers today are estimated to number about 8 million people.
Thus, if cultural rather than linguistic criteria are used, the Baluchi in Pakistan could total around 11 million in number.
Some 1-2 million Baluchi reside within the borders of Iran, and a further 300,000 are found in Afghanistan.
Baluchi communities are also found in Turkmenistan in Central Asia, in Oman in Arabia, and along the coast of East Africa, and also in the Pakistani city of Karachi.
In Pakistan, the eastern margins of Baluchistan are defined by the north-south-running Kirthar Hills and the Sulaiman Ranges.
In southern Balichistan Province, the mountain ranges swing westward to parallel the Makran coast.
Distinctions are made between Western, Southern, and Eastern Balu chi, and six individual dialects of Balichi are identified.

The Lori and Domb castes, though not of Baluchi blood, serve as professional musicians.
Some Baluchi communities along the southern Makran coast derive their living from fishing.
They form an ethnic and cultural population that has a transnational distribution, and whose natural affinities are more with their fellow Balachi in Iran and Afghanistan than with other Pakistanis.
It is little wonder that the Baliichi have very little sense of identity with Pakistan.
This alienation is intensified by the failure of the national government to promote economic development in Balichistan, one of the most underdeveloped areas of the country.
Many see poverty and lack of education as a major hindrance to Balichi economic and political advancement.
Even in major urban centers such as Karachi, Baltchi children are at a disadvantage.
After the Chagai nuclear tests by Pakistan in 1998, some Baltchi students hijacked a PIA (Pakistan International Airways) plane to register their disapproval and draw international attention to the prevailing sense of discrimination in Pakistan against Baluch people and Balichistan.
