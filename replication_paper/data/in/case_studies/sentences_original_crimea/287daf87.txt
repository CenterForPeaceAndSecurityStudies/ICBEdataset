That was its position from the days of the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great in the 18th century through the nationsâ shared history in the Soviet Union.
In recent years, successive Ukrainian governments have forged closer ties with the European Union and NATO, then sidled back toward Russia, and edged away again.
Understanding the Roots of the War"",""description"":""Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly made clear that he considers Ukraineâs place to be under Russiaâs thumb.
That was its position from the days of the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great in the 18th century through the nations&#x2019; shared history in the Soviet Union.
The territory of contemporary Ukraine became part of the Russian empire in the late 1700s after periods of rule under the Mongols or Tatars, the Poles and Lithuanians.
Ukraine regained its independence in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The percentage is higher in the country&#x2019;s Crimea peninsula and in some parts of the east.
Some Ukrainian citizens retain sympathy for the Kremlin, though the invasion eroded their ranks.
Yanukovych was nonetheless elected in 2010, but when he decided, under Kremlin pressure, to renege on a trade pact with the EU, mass demonstrations erupted and he was overthrown in February 2014.
Days before the invasion, Putin recognized the separatists&#x2019; self-styled republics, scuppering the Minsk accords, peace deals brokered by Germany and France that sought to end the violence there through a political settlement.
He said an objective of the invasion was the &#x201C;demilitarization&#x201D; of Ukraine.
That would make it unable to join NATO, whose expansion into countries that were once within Russia&#x2019;s sphere of influence Putin views as an encroachment on its interests.
Beyond that, Russia has for years complained about political ultra-nationalism in Ukraine.
But Russia, whose complaint is tied to a history of Ukrainian nationalists collaborating with Germany in World War II in an effort to break free of the Soviet Union and create an independent state, exaggerates its significance.
Ukraine&#x2019;s government is led by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is of Jewish heritage.

With war, Putin means to settle the direction of Ukraine’s future by force.
They share a long common past, dating back more than a millennium to the establishment of the first Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, in parts of what are today Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
In 1918, a year after Russia’s communist revolution, Ukraine declared independence, but in 1921, the Red Army conquered most of it and Ukraine became a republic within the Soviet Union.
The Ukrainian sense of a national identity was sharpened in the 1930s when Soviet policies punishing farmers in the republic who resisted mandates to collectivize produced the man-made famine known as the Holodomor, which killed an estimated 7 million people there.
