KIEV, Ukraine -Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has ordered the creation of a body to prepare a lawsuit against Russia for damages caused by separatists whom Moscow supports in the Donbass region and for its illegal annexation of the Crimea Peninsula.
The fighting in eastern Ukraine has destroyed much of the region's infrastrucure.
Poroshenko said he asked his cabinet to take steps for the ""speedy creation"" of an interagency coordinating body based on the law of reintegration adopted by Kiev in January.
Moscow's takeover of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its military, political, and economic support for separatists in eastern Ukraine prompted the United States, the European Union, and others to impose sanctions on Russia.
More than 11,000 people have been killed since April 2014 in the conflict between Ukrainian forces and the Russia-backed separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
At a summit earlier this month, Ukraine and the European Union, while agreeing on the need for reforms in Kiev, also condemned Russiaâ€™s seizure of Crimea and its backing of the separatists.
On July 31, the EU expanded its sanctions against Moscow to include companies that helped build a bridge from Russia to Crimea.
It is not known how effective such a suit against Russia would be or whether Moscow would even acknowledge it.
Kiev in the past has filed cases against Moscow with various international bodies with little success.
In January 2017, Ukraine filed a case against Russia with the Court of Justice, the highest United Nations court.
Considering he hasn't done anything, Poroshenko is trying to show the public how he is fighting for Ukraine, before the elections.
Germany threw Putin a lifeline regarding gas and oil. in the end, Russia is ts own worst enemy.
