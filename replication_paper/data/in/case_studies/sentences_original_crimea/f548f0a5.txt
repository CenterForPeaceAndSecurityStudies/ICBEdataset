A Ukrainian pilot detained in Russia since 2014 has arrived home following a dramatic prisoner swap with Russia.
Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, said a plane carrying Nadiya Savchenko had landed in Kiev.
She arrived from Russia in exchange for the release of two Russians held by Ukraine.
Savchenko’s return marks a triumphant moment for Ukraine, where she is viewed as a national hero.
It comes a few weeks before the European Union decides whether to extend sanctions against Russia, imposed following Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and his covert invasion of eastern Ukraine.
Quoting unnamed sources, Kommersant newspaper reported that the exchange was agreed late on Monday during a telephone conversation between Putin, Poroshenko, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande.
Russian media said that a special presidential plane sent by Putin had taken off from Kiev to Moscow.
The plane arrived back at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport, where the two men were reunited with their wives.
The president was quoted as saying that he hoped the prisoner exchange would reduce tensions in the Donbas region.
While in Russian jail, she was elected a member of the Ukrainian parliament.
She is widely seen in Ukraine as a symbol of resistance against Russia.
Dmitry Gudkov, the lone liberal opposition deputy in Russia’s parliament, argued that if Russia had exchanged Savchenko earlier, Alexandrov’s Ukrainian defense lawyer Yury Grabovsky might not have been murdered near Kiev in March.
People shouldn’t be hostages,” opposition PARNAS party member Andrei Pivovarov wrote on Twitter.
Ukrainian politicians were ecstatic with the reports Savchenko had been freed.
MP Alyona Shkrum wrote on Twitter that Savchenko’s mother was complaining that she hadn’t had time to cook a pot of borscht for her daughter’s arrival.
