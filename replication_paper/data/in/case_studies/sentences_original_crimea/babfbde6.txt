As the United States Treasury Department reports, the Government of the Russian Federation held a series of meetings to develop strategies to protect elites and oligarchs from new United States sanctions.

The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation offered methods of anonymous money transfers.
The government also allowed the purchase of eurobonds worth â‚¬ 3 billion to Russian business elites, offering them anonymity.

It is noted that Moscow called the list of prepared oligarchs an attempt to destabilize the country financially and politically in the year of elections.
At the same time, the Kremlin has already laid the foundation for sanctions against the United States in response, but is waiting to see how far Washington will go.
Russia is ready to ensure that the UN peacekeeping mission in the Donbas is located not only on the clash line in the Donbass, but also in its broader territories.

Russian elites, against which the United States is expected to introduce new sanctions, can be divided into four categories.
It is noted that a great interest in the alleged contributors to the list of oligarchs is supported by the assumptions that his publication could mean for the administration of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin and Russia as a whole.
So, the first category of elites that may be subject to sanctions are higher Kremlin officials who are directly involved with Putin's administration and mechanisms for implementing foreign policy.
According to intelligence officers, the fourth category the Russian oligarchs, who basically rose in the 90's, possess huge treasures and assets.
New United States sanctions against Russia will not be as powerful as to change Russia's policy in the Donbass and Crimea, but over time they can make the Russian side more compliant.

New sanctions will hardly be able to significantly affect the change of attitude towards Ukraine and the occupied territories, although they may in some way make the Russian side more inclined to partner conversation,"" the diplomat said.
Therefore, the main thing is not the difference between the approaches of the United States and the EU, but the settlement of the conflict, ""said Jacek Kluczkowski.

As you know, the project ""North Stream 2"" involves the construction and operation of two strands of the gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the coast of Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany.
Opponents of the project including Poland, the Baltic States and Denmark argue that North Stream 2 will increase EU dependence on Gazprom, which already supplies about one third of the EU's gas volume.
Germany, the lead beneficiary of the project, supports the North Stream 2 for economic reasons, stating that it will add resources to the market and reduce prices.

Paul Manafort, chief political strategist to Ukraine's ex-President Viktor Yanukovych, had an inside man in every country's ministry.
As reported by Censor.NET citing The Atlantic, Manafort's work, the source of the status he cherished, had taken a devastating turn.
For nearly a decade, he had counted primarily on a single client, albeit an exceedingly lucrative one.
Heâ€™d been the chief political strategist to the man who became the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, with whom heâ€™d developed a highly personal relationship.
Manafort would swim naked with his boss outside his banya, play tennis with him at his palace , and generally serve as an arbiter of power in a vast country.
Only a small handful of Americansâ€”oil executives, Cold War spymastersâ€”could claim to have ever amassed such influence in a foreign regime.
The power had helped fill Manafortâ€™s bank accounts; according to his recent indictment, he had tens of millions of dollars stashed in havens like Cyprus and the Grenadines.
Manafort had profited from the sort of excesses that make a country ripe for revolution.
And in the early months of 2014, protesters gathered on the Maidan, Kyivâ€™s Independence Square, and swept his patron from power.
Manafort avoided any harm by keeping a careful distance from the enflamed city.
But in his Kyiv office, heâ€™d left behind a safe filled with papers that he would not have wanted to fall into public view or the wrong hands.
Over the decades, Manafort had cut a trail of foreign money and influence into Washington, then built that trail into a superhighway.
When it comes to serving the interests of the worldâ€™s autocrats, heâ€™s been a great innovator.
His indictment in October after investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleges money laundering, false statements, and other acts of personal corruption.
But Manafortâ€™s role in Muellerâ€™s broader narrative remains carefully guarded, and unknown to the public.
And his personal corruption is less significant, ultimately, than his lifetime role as a corrupter of the American system.
That he would be accused of helping a foreign power subvert American democracy is a fitting coda to his lifeâ€™s story.
Sytnyk announced the start of identification of all persons indicated in the documents, adding the NABU would take measures to prevent their possible escape from the country.

In a few days, due to the history of the shutdown of MTS, or Vodafon, they became the object of mass denial and hatred, and they are cursed by thousands of people, ""he wrote in social networks.
No one, of course, believes in the statement of the Ministry of Communications That the connection is not due to Ukraine.
The whole republic, all the elderly are convinced that Phoenix took advantage of the situation in order to establish monopoly on the market"", the Russian propagandist writes.
