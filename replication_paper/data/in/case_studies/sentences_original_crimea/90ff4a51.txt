Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian students during a virtual address on Thursday that the war is not over yet, and is entering âthe final stage is the most difficult, the bloodiest.â He added that it is not time yet for him to tell Ukrainians abroad to return home.In a later speech, Zelensky said that Russian forces have âcompletely destroyedâ the southeastern region of Donbas.

Russia Turns Its Firepower On Odessa A destroyed hotel in Mykolaiv, UkraineVincenzo Circosta/ZUMAAir strikes on the port city of Odessa have become more frequent over the past three weeks, with fears rising that it could follow Mariupol as Vladimir Putinâs next principal target.Ukrainian forces resisting in and around the city of Mykolaiv, 80 miles up the coast, have prevented Odessa from being encircled by Russian forces.
But Anna Akage writes that Russia has multiple motivations, both symbolic and strategic, for focusing attacks on the southern city.
Chief among these reasons is that Moscow wants to intimidate Moldova, whose border lies only 35 miles away, with its own internal battle with pro-Russian separatists in the breakaway republic of Transnistria.

Ex German Chancellor Schroeder Stripped Of State Privileges For Putin Ties Former Federal Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDERFrankhoermann/Sven Simon/DPA/ZumaThe German parliament has announced that former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will lose his taxpayer-funded office and staff for failing to take distance from his Russian business ties and from Vladimir Putin himself, whom Schroeder still considers a personal friend.Schroeder is to be stripped of his office and staff, which cost â¬407,000 in taxpayer funds last year, reports Deutsche Welle.
Germanyâs conversative opposition also sought in vain to strip the 78-year-old former chancellor of his â¬100,000 annual pension too.
He noted that Japan will finance the sending of IAEA experts to Ukraine and the provision of the necessary equipment for Ukrainian nuclear facilities.

Arrest Warrant For Pro-Russia Former Ukrainian President Former President Viktor YanukovychSharifulin Valery/TASS/ZumaA Kyiv court has granted permission for the arrest of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Italyâs Mario Draghi, Franceâs Emmanuel Macron and Germanyâs Olaf Scholz would make for a magical little big story of the day.
Macron, 44, building on his political boy-wonder status after his recent reelection; Scholz, 64, looking a bit shaky having been welcomed to the world stage with Europe's most dangerous conflict in half-a-century; and Draghi, 74, the steady hand whoâs managed global economic crises but never war.
The three carried a message to the world that they were coming to support the Ukrainian people and their own 44-year-old leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Their arrival came as Russia was steadily gaining ground in the eastern Donbas region, and as suspicion was spreading that Europe wanted Zelensky to negotiate with the invaders.
No, the three assured their hosts, support was as strong as ever to strive for âvictoryâ over Russia, and more military and humanitarian aid would be coming.
The other message was that Ukraineâs bid to fast-track its application to join the European Union had their collective support.
It is a momentous choice that, as Lucie Robequain of Paris daily Les Echos points out, is as much about Europe as it is about Ukraine.
And the next photos showed the three Europeans during their tour of the destruction left by the Russian invaders in Iprin, a suburb of Kyiv.
But the day ended back on the diplomatic front, with Macron, Draghi and Scholz speaking before the gathered press and staff.
Itâs the kind of photo op of world leaders weâve grown accustomed to seeing on a near daily basis.
Still, the most famous diplomatic photos ever date all the way back to February 1945.
And it happened to take place not so far away from Kyiv, on the Black Sea port of Yalta, a city in the contested Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
The photos show Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and United States President Franklin D Roosevelt bundled up against the winter cold, sitting among their military and diplomatic staff, and the press.
The annals of world history tell us the âBig Threeâ essentially sorted out the post World War II map there in Yalta, paving the way for the Cold War showdown that would dominate the rest of the 20th century.In retrospect, for better or worse, it can seem like things couldnât have turned out any differently.
But we know reality is never so tidy, and world leaders are both subjects and shapers of events.
And so, one day in the distant or not-so-distant future, we may look back on those photos of Macron, Scholz and Draghi chuckling together on their train ride to Kyiv.
Of course, Kyiv will face its own set of challenges leading up to an offer of membership, such as eradicating corruption.

Vladimir Putin has repeated that protecting ethnic Russians and the Russian-speaking populations of Ukraine was a driving motivation for his invasion.
In the largest city on the Azov Sea, with a population of half a million people, Ukrainians make up slightly less than half of the city's population, and Mariupol's second-largest national ethnicity is Russians.
As of 2001, when the last census was conducted, 89.5% of the city's population identified Russian as their mother tongue. .push; The martyrdom of MariupolBetween 2018 and 2019, I spent several months in Mariupol.
It is a rugged but beautiful city dotted with Soviet-era architecture, featuring wide avenues and hillside parks, and an extensive industrial zone stretching along the shoreline.
There was a vibrant youth culture and art scene, with students developing projects to turn their city into a regional cultural center with an international photography festival.
There were also many offices of international NGOs and human rights organizations, a consequence of the fact that Mariupol was the last major city before entering the occupied zone of Donbas.
Many natives of the contested regions of Luhansk and Donetsk had moved there, taking jobs in restaurants and hospitals.
I had fond memories of the welcoming from locals who were quicker to smile than in some other parts of Ukraine.
The official civilian death toll of Mariupol is estimated at more than 3,000.
There are no language or ethnic-based statistics of the victims, but itâs likely the majority were Russian speakers.
So letâs be clear, Putin is bombing the very people he has claimed to want to rescue.
In none of the cities that are now being bombed by the Russian army to supposedly liberate them has the Russian language been suppressed or have the Russian-speaking population been discriminated against.
Sociologist Mikhail Mishchenko explains that studies have found that the vast majority of Ukrainians donât consider language a political issue.
For reasons of history, culture and the similarities of the two languages, Ukraine is effectively a bilingual nation.
Approximately the same number of people say the same about Ukrainian.âIn general, there is no problem of communication and understanding.
Often there will be conversations where one person speaks Ukrainian, and the other responds in Russian.
Geographically, the Russian language is more dominant in the eastern and central parts of Ukraine, and Ukrainian in the west.

My mother taught me that the more languages I know the more human I am.Like in other countries, these differences have been the source of conflict in our past.
But it is who we are and will always be, and real progress has been made over the past three decades to embrace our multitudes.
Our Jewish, Russian-speaking president is the most visible proof of that â and is in fact part of what our soldiers are fighting for.Many in Moscow were convinced that Russian troops would be welcomed in Ukraine as liberating heroes by Russian speakers.
Instead, young soldiers are forced to shoot at people who scream in their native language.Starving people ina street of Kharkiv in 1933, during the famineDiocesan Archive of Vienna /BA InnitzerThe meaning of genocidePutin has tried to rally the troops by warning that in Ukraine a âgenocideâ of ethnic Russians is being carried out by a government that must be âde-nazified.â These are, of course, words with specific definitions that carry the full weight of history.
