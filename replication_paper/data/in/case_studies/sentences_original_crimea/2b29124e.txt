These hopes were not entirely misplaced, as Medvedev pursued a reset with the incoming Obama administration and spoke about the importance of the rule of law domestically.
Putin’s candidacy and the subsequent fraudulent parliamentary and presidential elections sparked popular protests, followed by new political repressions.
Economic growth rates in its aftermath stagnated, despite the fact that the price of oil generally remained high.
As a result, Putin’s popular support within the country started to decrease in 2012 and 2013, while Russia’s political and economic ties with CIS countries showed signs of decline.
To keep its political grip both internally and regionally, the Kremlin started preparations for more radical steps in accordance with the old frozen-conflicts strategy.
When Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych did so, demonstrations involving tens of thousands began.
An effort to repress those protests brought hundreds of thousands into the streets.
When the subsequent cycle of demonstrations and repression led to the Revolution of Dignity of February 2014, which prompted Yanukovych to flee Ukraine for Russia, Putin responded by seizing Crimea forcibly, “annexing” it, and starting a hybrid war in Donbas.
This in turn prompted Western sanctions, increased NATO deployments to the east, and the tensest East-West relations since the height of the Cold War.
For internal Russian audiences, the “return of Crimea” and “standing up to the West” were claimed by Putin as a political victory, which led to his popular approval spiking even higher than before 2012, allegedly to 86 percent.
At the same time, domestic problems worsened as Western sanctions were accompanied by a sharp fall in hydrocarbon prices in late 2014.
Russian GNP fell by over 3 percent in 2015 and living standards by nearly 10 percent.
Recovery since then has been slow, even as oil prices rose to over $70 per barrel.
