Share United States Denounces Russia's Crimea Annexation On Referendum Anniversary share Print WASHINGTON -The United States on March 16 issued a sharp condemnation of Russia’s seizure of Crimea and the referendum that Moscow staged there and later held up as justification for its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula.
The denunciation by the United States State Department came on the third anniversary of the referendum organized following the seizure of key government buildings in Crimea by Russian special forces without insignia after former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia amid mass street protests across the country.
It was also the latest example of the continuation of Washington’s tough public stance on Crimea that President Donald Trump, who has pledged to seek better ties with Moscow, inherited from his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Trump’s stated desire for rapprochement with Moscow -and his suggestion that he could consider lifting sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia in response to the Crimea annexation -has rattled European allies who fear he could turn a blind eye to Russian expansionism.
Less than two months into Trump’s presidency, however, there is no public indication that his administration is giving ground on Crimea.
Speaking to reporters in Moscow the same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the possibility that Crimea could be returned to Ukraine under some sort of deal with the United States.
The Trump administration has also continued the Obama administration’s stiff opposition to Russia’s backing of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine in a conflict that has killed more than 9,750 since April 2014.
