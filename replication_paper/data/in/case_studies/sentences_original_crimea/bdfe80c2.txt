The Ukrainian state must take all possible measures to improve the situation and ensure human rights and guarantees of security in the area of protection of persons from the persecution by the Russian Federation, as well as other authoritarian regimes.
In the context of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, occupation of the AR of Crimea and Sevastopol, war in the east of Ukraine and creation of quasi-state entities, so called LPR and DPR effectively controlled by the Russian Federation, the issue of the security of Ukrainian and foreign citizens who became victims of the persecution by the Russian Federation and its satellites has extremely exacerbated.
In recent years, the authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin in the Russian Federation has become even more centralized and rigid.
The war against Ukraine and occupation of the Crimean Peninsula are accompanied with the suppression of civil and political freedoms in Russia itself.
New repressive laws were adopted, and already existing ones are also selectively applied for persecution, defamation, prosecution, imprisonment, detention, fines, and pressure on individuals and organizations criticizing the authorities.
The changes to anti-terrorism laws known as “Yarovayas package” gave the authorities sweeping powers.
The persecution targeted Ukrainian citizens, as well as Russian citizens and organizations supporting the Ukrainian government or criticizing the occupation of the Crimea and military aggression of Russia in the east of Ukraine.
In Russia, the historical revisionism of Soviet totalitarianism is underway.
They practice Stalin-style kidnappings, detentions, arrests, searches and torture of detainees charged with fictitious crimes.
Forty-six persons are recognized political prisoners, 97 people are victims of persecution for religious beliefs, 39 are victims of persecution with non-custodial sentences, and another 46 people are likely victims.
Under such conditions, many Russians, victims of persecution by the Russian authorities, are seeking refuge in Ukraine, and Ukrainians who are persecuted by the RF set their hopes on Ukraine to be protected.
In accordance with paragraph 52 of the UNHCR report “Discussion on international protection related to the development of the situation in Ukraine--Operational Update III” of September 24, 2015, the UNHCR does not consider the designation of Ukraine as a “safe country of origin” to be appropriate.
The states should remove Ukraine from the “safe country of origin” lists.
Unfortunately, in our opinion, Ukraine does not meet the criteria of the EU as a safe country of origin.
Although Ukrainian legislation generally complies with international standards in this area, the enforcement practice remains far from such standards.
The annual report of the human rights organizations Human Rights in Ukraine-2016 contains data on murders, enforced disappearances, indiscriminate violence during a conflict with the RF, the use of torture and ill-treatment, etc.
Thus, on June 1, 2017, an attempt was commissioned on the life of Adam Osmayev and Amina Okuyev.
According to Herashchenko, the man was legalized in Ukraine in February 2016 under the name of Olexandr Dakar.
But on October 30, during the second assassination attempt, Amina Okuyeva was killed, and Adam Osmayev was wounded.
She died near the Village of Hlevakha, Kyiv Oblast; the unknown persons delivered fire from the bushes aiming at the car of Okuyeva and Osmayev.
Denis Voronenkov, an ex-deputy of the Russia State Duma, who received Ukrainian citizenship, was shot dead in the downtown Kyiv on March 23, 2017.
He was the native of Pavlohrad Pavlo Parshov, who previously served in the National Guard, but was sacked for non-fulfillment of the terms of the contract.
Antin Herashchenko called him “Russian subversive” as according to Ukrainian law enforcers, before attacking Voronenkov, Pavlo Parshov visited Russia.
On September 8, 2017, in the downtown Kyiv, near the Bessarabian market, the car of Timur Makhauri was blown up, in which his acquaintance was with her child.
Makhauri died, the woman suffered heavy bodily injuries, and the child received slight injuries.
The killed man was a citizen of Georgia, volunteer of the Chechen International Peacekeeping Battalion named after Dzhokhar Dudayev.
Belarusian journalist Pavlo Sheremet, who had been working in Ukraine for several years, was blown up in a car a mine mine in downtown Kyiv on July 20, 2016.
Later, video from surveillance cameras was uploaded to the Internet; it showed several people mining the journalists car on the night before the explosion.
In May, the journalists of the “Investigation.Info” released a film-investigation, which argued that Igor Ustymenko, former SBU security officer, allegedly stayed near the Sheremets house on the night before the assassination.
In addition, the author of the journalistic investigation Dmytro Gnap said that the SBU employees confiscated the server with video from surveillance cameras in one of the stores near the Sheremets house, and returned it empty.Despite the strong statements made by the top state officials about the need for a quick and effective investigation into the murder and granting him the status of priority, the investigation has still not found the killers of Pavlo Sheremet or instigators of the crime.
The subordinates of Shapoval carried out operations in the zone of ATO and in uncontrolled areas of the Donbas.
The main versions include Russian trace and revenge for successful operations in the uncontrolled territory of the in the separate regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.
The Haraberiushs car was blown up on March 31, 2017 in the residential quarter of Mariupol.
Ivan Mamchur, who had served in the special units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Donbas and was an internal security major, was shot dead on September 16, 2016 in the corridor of the house where he lived in Rivne.
Subsequently, one of the murder suspects was detained while attempting to enter Russia.
Attorney General Yuriy Lutsenko said that the detainee, a resident of Mariupol, said that he had murdered Ivan Mamchur at the request of the bodies of the FSB of Russia.
The only positive example of the work of the SBU murder prevention is the detention of two malefactors, who, according to the SBU, intended to attach an explosive device to the Anton Heraschenkos car and activate it with the help of a mobile phone.
The SBU completed the pre-trial investigation into an attempt on the life of Peoples Deputy Anton Herashchenko in connection with his public and state activities.
As the investigation has established, an attempt was organized by one of the active members of the terrorist organization “LPR” to carry out the order of the General Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
The suspect is hiding from the investigation in the RF and in the temporarily occupied territories.
Abduction of the oppositionists by special services of the RF from the territory of Ukraine was practiced also before the EuroMaidan.
So, on October 20, 2012, Leonid Razvazzhaev was abducted near the UNHCR office.
The Head Office of the MIA of Ukraine in Kyiv said that no applications concerning the disappearance of this person were received.
However, there is a reasonable suspicion that the Ukrainian secret services have helped to abduct him.
After EuroMaidan and with the onset of RF aggression against Ukraine, violent disappearances, abductions and luring of people from the territory of Ukraine becoming an element of the hybrid war.
Oleksandr Kostenko, resident of the Crimea, former militia officer, took part in the EuroMaidan.
According to his lawyer Dmytro Sotnykov, after EuroMaydan, he was kidnapped by unknowns and, by some channels, without any documentation, was taken to the city of Bryansk, Russia.
On February 5, 2015, he was kidnapped from his own house in Simferopol by the unknown persons and taken out in a minibus without identifying marks.
On February 6, after torture, Kostenko was “found” in the FSB in a grave condition, with a broken arm and dislocation of the forearm.
Kostenko was tortured by former Crimean SBU and now FSB officers Tyschenin and Shambazov.
It was originally reported that Fedir Kostenko managed to enter the territory of the Crimea, but later this information was not confirmed.
The Crimean investigating authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings.
The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine stated that he had not crossed the administrative border.
Eskander Ibraimov, inhabitant of Simferopol, shortly after the annexation of the Crimea by Russia, moved to the mainland of Ukraine.
According to his wife, he left Vinnytsia for Moscow to meet his future business partner, a Russian from Kabardino-Balkaria, Rustam Mann.
For the last time Ibraimov phoned his wife on the night of June 20, 2014.
The appeals to state institutions of Ukraine and Russia did not provide information sufficient for Ibraimovs searches.
From the criminal case filed by the FSB against the fugitive from Russia, Ingush Ruslan Meyriyev, it is known that Rustam Mann was questioned as a witness, and subsequently as a suspect two months before the scheduled meeting with Ibrahimov.
Therefore, there are serious reasons to suppose that, at the time of the disappearance of Ibraimov and Mann, who stopped answering phone calls on June 20, 2014, Mann was controlled by the FSB and was used to lure Ibraimov out of Ukraine.
Apparently, the disappearance of Ibraimov is violent and involves Russian special services.
Stanislav Klykh and Mykola Karpiuk were lured out into the territory of Russia and subsequently accused of the so-called “Chechen case”--in the creation of a gang and murders of Russian servicemen during Chechen events twenty years ago.
According to the mother of Stanislav Klykh, he was lured out to Russia through his girlfriend Victoria, under the pretext of her pregnancy.
Both Klykh and Karpiuk underwent terrible tortures, which made Klykh mentally ill.
From the persons under investigation, they wrested evidence against A Yatsenyuk, D Yarosh, and Tiahnybok brothers.
There are grounds to consider this case organized in order to discredit the new leadership of Ukraine.
In May 2016, the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic sentenced Klykh and Karpiuk to 20 and 22. years of a strict regime colony, respectively.
Pavlo Hryb, 19-year-old Ukrainian blogger, was abducted by Russian special services on the territory of Belarus on August 24, 2017.
He was transferred to the RF under compulsion, where he was charged with incitement to blow up a school, which allegedly revealed in his communication with an online girlfriend.
By blackmail the FSB officers forced her to play the role of a lure in a transborder special operation aimed at persuading Hryb to arrive in Belarus with subsequent abduction.
Pavlos life is endangered as he lives with a disability associated with malfunction of the cardiovascular system.
They do not give Pavlo necessary medications and Ukrainian doctors are denied access to him.
In June 2015, Ukraine joined the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and must abide by all its norms.
Under international law, the enforced disappearance is a crime, and under certain circumstances, even a crime against humanity.
Instead, we we are compelled to note that the SSU has been conducting enforced disappearing for a long time now.
In particular, we know about three cases of abduction by SBU officers and the illegal extradition to RF of persons who wished to apply or applied for refugee status in Ukraine.
Aminat Babayeva was detained on September 9, 2016, by border guards at the border crossing point at the Kharkiv Airport, although there were no legitimate grounds for detention.
She was deported from Turkey due to the fact that her former husband was suspected of participating in military operations in Syria on the IDIL side.
Babayeva maintained that she had not seen her ex-husband for two years.
Her friends turned to the Kharkiv Human Rights Group with a request for legal assistance, but in violation of the law the KHPG lawyer was not allowed to see Babaeva.
The SBU officers, who arrived at the airport, urged Babayeva to agree to return to Russia, then to Belarus.
After intervention of the MIA leaders Babayeva was admitted to the country.
She put up at a hotel and on Monday, September 12, she applied to the Kharkiv Regional Department of the Migration Service for asylum, from where the unknowns abducted her, forced her to get in the car and drove her away.
One of the abductors was identified by Aminat as a security officer named Arthur who talked with her at the airport.
Babayeva was brought to the Goptivka border crossing with Russia and handed over to Russian border guards.
In April 2017, the representatives of the Ukrainian competent authorities, probably SBGS or SSU, illegally transferred to Russia Ahmed Isakov resident of Buynaksk, Dagestan.
Subsequently, he went to Turkey, where, according to unconfirmed information, he lived on a false passport of a citizen of Ukraine.
Immediately upon arrival at the Kharkiv airport, the fake Ukrainian passport was found and Isakov was detained.
He was denied to write an application for asylum and, without proper legal procedures, he was forcibly sent to Russia without the possibility of appealing against this decision.
In Russia, he was taken into custody, and a case was registered against him for illegal storage of weapons.
In 2016, a criminal case was initiated against Vladimir Yegorov, member of the Yabloko party for calls for extremist activity for his post in the social network “Vkontakte” , in which he strongly spoke about President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
On June 13, 2017, Egorov crossed the border with Ukraine on the internal passport of the RF and wrote an application for asylum at the checkpoint Senkivka.
The SMS in Chernihiv issued documents and certificate of a person seeking asylum in Ukraine.
On July 5, 2017, the officers of the SSU abducted him from the place of temporary work, brought him home for his belongings and took him to a neutral strip near the Senkivka checkpoint.
After this, following the request of the Public TV, the SSU officially answered that it did not take a decision on forced return or refoulement and entry ban.
Egorov entered Belarus, where he disappeared on July 27, and was subsequently found in a temporary isolator in his native town of Toropets of the Tver Oblast, Russia.
The Memorial Human Rights Center recognized Egorov as a political prisoner.
After the pre-trial investigation the case was sent to trial and Egorov was released from custody on November 16, 2017.
The Ukrainian state must take all possible measures to improve the situation and ensure human rights and guarantees of security in the sphere of protection of persons from the persecution by Russian Federation, as well as other authoritarian regimes.
This material is based upon the written request by Escander Ibraimovs wife Mariana Kudinova to the Kharkiv Human Rights Group.
According to Radio Freedom journalist Anvar Derkach, who monitors violations of human rights of Muslims in Ukraine.
