Today, the Donbas is shorthand for two Ukrainian oblasts , Donetsk and Luhansk, based on two cities which were both founded by British industrialists.
Charles Gascoigne, an Englishman, built an iron works in what is now Luhansk in 1795; and Welshman John Hughes started a steel plant and coal mine in Donetsk in 1869.
European colonists – Russians, Ukrainians, Romanians, Serbs, Greeks – were encouraged to settle there.
But after the Industrial Revolution took hold in the late 19th century, the Donbas was largely settled by Russian workers.
By 1913, it produced nearly 90% of Russian coal.The Soviet Union absorbed most of modern-day Ukraine in 1922, and the Donbas became one of the USSR’s main coaland steel-producing areas; it was dubbed “the heart of Russia” in Soviet propaganda.
In Soviet and post-Soviet times, the cities were largely Russian ethnically and linguistically, while the villages remained Ukrainian.
Ukraine’s 2001 census found that ethnic Ukrainians form 58% of the population of Luhansk Oblast and 56.9% of Donetsk Oblast; ethnic Russians formed 39% and 38.2% respectively.
Initially, Russia fought a “hybrid” war, using local fighters backed by Russian special forces and mercenaries, and by extensive military support.
But when Ukrainian forces went on the offensive, threatening to take back nearly all the separatist-held territories – including the prized port city of Mariupol – Russia launched a conventional invasion in response.In February 2015, a ceasefire brokered by France and Germany – known as Minsk II – froze the conflict, leaving about a third of Luhansk and Donetsk under separatist control.
A 500km “line of contact”, bristling with trenches and landmines, cut the region in two.
Donbas certainly has a political culture distinct from much of Ukraine; the language issue has caused resentment, and some rightwing Ukrainian nationalist parties are explicitly Russophobic.
In their eight-years of existence, the republics of DNR and LNR have evolved into “North Korea-like statelets”, says Mansur Mirovalev on Al Jazeera.
Both have restored the Soviet constitutions adopted by Stalin; in Donetsk, a 13.5m statue of Lenin dominates the main square.
The death penalty is prescribed for various crimes, an anomaly in modern-day Europe.Conversations, phone calls and text messages are monitored by secret police; arbitrary arrests are common, and many reports suggest interrogators have used torture to extract confessions.
There is no press freedom; electoral fraud is widespread; corruption is rife.Both republics are “entirely dependent on Moscow for financial and military support”, a report by the Freedom House NGO said this year.
Crossings into Ukrainian-controlled territory are tightly restricted, and schools, universities, public services and businesses are dominated by people loyal to the separatist leadership.As part of the statelets’ “Russification” campaigns, official-language status for Ukrainian has been abolished, and schools have stopped teaching Ukrainian language and history.
The “liberation” of those living under “neo-Nazi” rule in Donbas is Putin’s casus belli, and before launching the invasion in February he recognised the separatist republics.
It is generally thought that, if he manages to conquer the Donbas, he will annex it, as he did with Crimea in 2014.
