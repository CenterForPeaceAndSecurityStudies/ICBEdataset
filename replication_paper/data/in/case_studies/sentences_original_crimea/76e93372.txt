Ukrainians tend to have more positive attitudes towards Russia than vice versa.
One in four Russians said their attitudes towards Ukraine were ‘good’ or ‘very good’, a significant drop from 39% in May 2016 – which was itself a significant increase from 27% in February 2016.
Some zigzaggin’ goin’ on here. 56% of Russians said their attitudes towards Ukraine were ‘bad’ or ‘very bad,’ a significant increase from 47% in May.
The data over time since 2008 is pretty interesting, so interesting I decided to make a barely readable graph.
At no point are Ukrainians’ attitudes towards Russia worse than Russians’ attitudes towards Ukraine, even in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea and the start of war in Donbas by May 2014.
At every single data point Ukrainians have more positive and less negative feelings about Russia than Russians have for Ukraine.
Russians’ attitudes towards Ukraine got really damn low in late 2008/early 2009.
Ukrainians’ attitudes have got a bit better towards Russia recently but, not surprisingly, are still far below pre-Maidan levels.
I can’t explain the zigzagging with Russians’ attitudes over 2015/2016.
I took a look at IDEA’s Voter Turnout Database, which has data on all parliamentary, presidential and European Parliament elections across the world since 1945.
Americans vote in congressional elections every two years unlike the rest of us who go every four, five or six years.
The lowest turnout in recent Canadian history was 2008 , if anyone other than me cares about Canada as a reference point.
We’d had one less than three years before, both producing Stephen Harper minorities, or ‘hung parliaments’ for the more British among you.
As for the UK, the lowest was 59.4% turning out in 2001 for Tony Blair and Labour’s second straight victory.
It gets worse when you look at the entire data set for parliamentary elections …out of more than 1400 national parliamentary elections worldwide, 4% had voter turnouts of 40% or less.
