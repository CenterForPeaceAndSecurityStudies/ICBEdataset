One Ukrainian soldier's storyDave Lawler, author of Axios WorldAxios on facebookAxios on twitterAxios on linkedinAxios on emailShadrin after a firefight with Russian troops.
Andrii Shadrin’s unit sets off daily from its makeshift base to points along the front lines in Luhansk Oblast in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where the war with Russia rages on.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has described soldiers in the Donbas like Shadrin as some of the best Ukraine has.
They were often interrupted — by shelling, by orders for a mission, and once when he said a drone had been spotted overhead.He says the shelling is constant and ""chaotic,"" striking mainly civilian infrastructure.
The Institute for the Study of War with AEI’s Critical Threats Project; Map: Jared Whalen/AxiosIn recent weeks, Russian forces have gained ground.
The last Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol surrendered on Tuesday after a weeks-long siege.More than 90% of Luhansk, where Shadrin is fighting, is now under Russian control.Shadrin's unit has yet to lose a soldier, but hardly a day goes by without news that a friend has been killed, severely wounded or captured.
The morning after our first conversation, Shadrin's unit came under fire as it was repairing equipment on an outpost directly on the front line.
As Russian infantry and tanks began to advance on them, a piece of shrapnel struck his leg.
A trained medic, Shadrin, 26, treated his own wound until he could be evacuated to a hospital.
Once he realized he could walk, he returned to base.Destruction in Donbas.
Andrii ShadrinSome of his worst days have come when traveling through recently shelled towns.
Shadrin acknowledges that many civilians who remained behind likely supported Russia before the full-scale invasion.
Vladimir Putin and the Russian army did a lot for the unity of Ukrainians all around Ukraine.
Because everybody now understands whom we are dealing with,"" he says.Destruction in Donbas.
Andrii ShadrinA family dividedShadrin says his parents don’t share that view of Russia, or the war.
I am a Nazi for them,” Shadrin says, though his parents, who were born in Soviet Russia, haven’t told him that directly.
Their only correspondence had been weekly text to inform them he's alive.

When those protests broke out, Shadrin traveled to Kyiv for a few days to take part, without telling his parents.
It’s hard to picture, looking at the thick-bearded, bareheaded and grizzled warrior on the video call, until he shares his ID photo from that time — a boyish face from the other side of the war.
Shadrin was 18 then, studying IT in college and taking extra lessons to perfect his English.

They took all the goods... and just left me lying on the ground,"" he adds.
In the meantime, he volunteered for Right Sector, a militia that has been described as ultra-nationalist or far-right.
Shadrin says that wasn't his experience, and that he served with soldiers from diverse backgrounds.
But because Russia deems Right Sector an extremist group, Shadrin says he’d be arrested if he returned to Russian-occupied Crimea.

What do I want to do""Shadrin admits that the outcome of Russia's Donbas offensive is uncertain, given the force of the Russian troops and artillery.But in the longer term, he's confident the Ukrainians will fight as long as it takes to secure victory.
If you bring me off this service and this war, you will meet — maybe in a couple of months — a regular 26-year-old man who likes to have a couple of beers, have a chat with a girl in a pub … spend some time on a beach or something like that,"" Shadrin says.The image hangs there like an apparition, before he waves it away.
I've lost a lot of my friends, I've lost a lot of my brothers, and of course I don't want to lose any more,” he says.
