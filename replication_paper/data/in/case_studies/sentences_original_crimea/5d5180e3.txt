Direct-Line-with-Vladimir-Putin en.kremlin.ruAs Russia has pursued an increasingly aggressive foreign policy in recent years, a new study argues that media monitoring can shed light on the Kremlin’s opaque decision-making and help explain Russian president Vladimir Putin’s tight grip on power, despite his domestic economic woes.
Studying the framing methods used by the Kremlin show that media analysis could be a useful tool for exploring shifts in Russia’s domestic and foreign policy.
For Dr Lankina, Russia’s media management represents evolution from the former Soviet system, where the government relied almost exclusively on censorship.
Domestically, this media strategy is helping manage discontent to divert public anger away from the Kremlin as Russia’s economic woes have deepened.
Dr Lankina feels that this tactical media strategy has proved to be an important asset to the Putin regime, and helps explain why he is a rare example of a leader who has thrived during an economic downturn.
