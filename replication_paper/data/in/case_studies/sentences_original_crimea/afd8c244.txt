A roundtable discussion commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster was held at the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation on April 26, 2016.
McConnell, recalled the Soviet information blackout about the catastrophe and how only a week after the explosion, while radiation continued to spew from the damaged reactor, the May Day parade in Kyiv went on as planned with thousands of people of all ages exposed to Chornobyl's radioactive cloud.
She said for her, the biggest lessons from the Chornobyl disaster pertain not to the issue of nuclear safety but rather to how a totalitarian state deals with a catastrophe versus the response of an open society.
She drew a stark comparison between the Soviet cover up of the nuclear accident at Chornobyl and the quick and comprehensive Japanese and international response to the Fukushima power plant crisis.
McConnell also noted that pledging conferences that have been convened to assist the victims of Chornobyl as well as the victims of Russia's war against Ukraine have never met their goals.
For Ambassador Valeriy Chaly the Chornobyl disaster had a deep personal dimension.
His father was a Chornobyl ""liquidator""-the title given to thousands who were involved in the rescue, containment and clean-up operations surrounding the nuclear power plant-and was also involved in establishing a museum devoted to Chornobyl.
Ambassador Chaly said that Chornobyl is a symbol of the old Soviet style of governance and is an important reminder of the failed Soviet culture of security lapses and suppression of news and information, as a well as a general lack of respect for human life.
Ominously, there are concerns that Russia may deploy nuclear weapons in the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
Ukraine still relies on nuclear power for generating a large portion of its electricity and needs additional international support for completing the Chornobyl containment structure and dealing with other aspects of the aftermath of the disaster, explained Valriy Chaly.
In his presentation, Mykola Riabchuk reminded the audience that ""liquidators"" were being sent to quell the disaster without any gear to protect them from lethal doses of radiation.
They were being sent to their deaths as the Soviet system did not care about human lives.
A closed society is dangerous for its own citizens, for its own people.
Mykola Riabchuk, who was residing in Kyiv at the time, recalls how he learned about the Chornobyl catastrophe from his father, who was living in Lviv.
His father heard about the Polish government's rapid response to Chornobyl on Polish radio and more and more Ukrainians soon came to learn about the seriousness with which neighboring countries were trying to mitigate the impact of Chornobyl's radiation.
And whatever nationality you were, those living in Ukraine all suffered from the policies of Moscow -all were in the same boat and this consolidated people.
He went on to say that it also contributed to the emergence of non-governmental organizations , the environmental movement, and many other important changes in people's mentality occurred after that.
He concluded that people realized that the system and imperial rule were a disaster for all and something should be changed.
The Embassy of Ukraine in Washington commemorating the anniversary of the Chornobyl disaster with an event on April 27th.
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Rose Gottemoeller and Representative Marcy Kaptur , a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus spoke at the gathering.
As reported by the Embassy of Ukraine, addressing the audience, Congresswoman Kaptur underlined that ""the effects of the disaster linger socially, economically, and culturally and Chornobyl's legacy remains a heavy burden for the people of Ukraine.
She also reaffirmed the strong support by the United States for Ukraine and its democratic aspirations.
Washington, DC Olena Honcharova, founder of the Kharkiv Station NGO which assists internally displaced persons in Ukraine, spoke at a U.S.-Ukraine Foundation roundtable on April 25, 2016.
She was in Washington to receive the Refugees InternationalRichard Holbrooke Award, given to an outstanding national NGO working with the displaced.
Regarding the dire situation of hundreds of thousands of IDPs in Ukraine, Olena Honcharova emphasized that there continues to be a great need for clothing, medicine, hygienic products and housing.
Honcharova expressed concern that Ukrainians are getting tired of the conflict and, as a result, private donations of assistance for the IDPs are in decline.
She was also critical of what she views as unsympathetic characterizations of IDPs by some Ukrainian government officials.
Honcharova criticized the withholding or delay of social payments from residents of the occupied territories who cross the line of contact and come to Ukrainian government-controlled areas to obtain those payments.
She stressed that as citizens of Ukraine, they are legally entitled to their pensions, for example.
Many are not getting the help from the government that they need, she said.
Honcharova said that Kharkiv Station obtains support from numerous donors and volunteers and partners with other non-governmental organizations in the region.
There have even been families who planned to move to Russia but having interacted with volunteers, having obtained some assistance, have stayed in Ukraine.
The role of public radio, playing an important role in strengthening democracy in Ukraine, was discussed by seven members of the Hromadske Radio team, during an event at the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation on Monday evening, April 25.
The trip was sponsored by United States Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine and organized by Razom for Ukraine.
Hromadske Radio is an NGO founded by a group of professional broadcasting journalists who came together in 2013 to launch an independent public radio for the Ukrainian audience.
Washington, DC, April 18 The role of media in a democracy is often underestimated.
It's difficult to have a system of governance built around the will of the majority without citizens having reliable sources of information.
Today we can see that freedom of the press is directly correlated with successful democratic rule.
That is why the role of media in post-Maidan Ukraine is of utmost importance.
The ability to guarantee freedom of the press and information is one of the key components of Ukraine's democratization process.
Roundtable discussions were held at both the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation on Tuesday, April 12th regarding the media in Ukraine.
NED's roundtable which was conducted in a ""without attribution"" format focused on ownership of Ukraine's major media outlets.
Whoever owns the news has the ability to distort and reshape public perceptions of reality.
Thanks to a new Ukrainian law on transparency of media ownership it has been officially revealed that Ukraine's national television networks remain under the control of a handful of oligarchs.
The control of Ukrainian media by a select few extends to online news sources as well.
This is a particularly disconcerting development as the Internet has been considered by many to be a refuge for independent sources of information.
Topics ranged from their coverage of the United States election to the cultural differences between Ukrainians and Americans.
While the U.S.-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty were for decades the de facto, nearly exclusive Washington and foreign bureaus for Ukraine's media market that situation is changing.
Now 1+1, Ukraina TV and ICTV, commercial broadcasting giants, are also regularly airing stories about American life, produced by Ukrainian, Washington-based correspondents.
While Ukraine's media situation is far from perfect we're beginning to see a steady improvement.
The usage of social media and personal blogs as organizational tools during the early stages of the Maidan demonstrated the power of peer-sourced information.
Roundtable with Lesia Vasylenko, founder of Ukrainian NGO ""Legal 100"" The U.S.-Ukraine Foundation hosted a roundtable with Lesia Vasylenko, a young, proactive change-driven social activist, who is also the founder of Legal100 an NGO that provides support to Ukrainian soldiers and their families.
Lesia talked about the creation of the organization and challenges her team faces daily at the Foundation on October 27th, 2015.
Legal100 is working on distributing legal information to those who are in urgent need of it.
Vasylenko says that she is worried about ATO fighters who come home and don't know how to get legal support.
Vasylenko is concerned that, not knowing a better way to do it, they will turn to arms.
Distributing information including phone consultations, educational videos on relevant legislation, and printed materials for those in the regions without access to the Internet.
Building a network of veterans bringing these people together, so that they can help each other and be better prepared to defend their civil rights.
Even though, the situation in Eastern Ukraine looks less worrisome today, the number of calls Legal100 receives only grows as the soldiers come home.
There is a hotline that receives up to 40 calls per day requesting information on the social rights of the soldiers.
Volunteers either provide necessary information via phone or refer the caller to one of the legal professionals registered in their database.
Vasylenko also noted that the ultimate goal at this point is to draft legislative proposals.
She deals with many legal cases and sees multiple drawbacks in the outdated military law.
Having to deal with numerous cases of the ATO soldiers, Vasylenko and her team have the first-hand knowledge of the legal gaps of the current legislation.
She emphasized the need for systematic change and she is dedicated to working on legislative proposals that would better correspond to the needs of new veterans.
We wish Lesia Vasylenko best of luck in her challenging work and hope for future cooperation with her.
She is seeking a master's degree in international economics by May 2017.
Patriarch Filaret, the Head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv and All Rus'-Ukraine shared his views on the conflict in Ukraine and explained why the Ukraine Freedom Support Act should be implemented.
He started off by trying to explain why about 80% of Russians are ready to fight for Ukraine.
It was stated that, just like Gorbachov, Putin cannot imagine a strong Russia without Ukraine.
Representatives of the Russian political elite do not see Russia just as any other country; they want to create a world's superpower.
The majority of Russian citizens seem to like that idea, but in order to achieve this status Russia needs to restore the control over quite a few Eastern European countries.
Thus, we can see that implementation of the Minsk Protocol was not something Russia was looking for.
Putin's plan possibly includes not only occupation of Crimea and Donbass, but also occupation of Kyiv, Warsaw, Vilnius etc., and the only way to stop him could be providing necessary aid to Ukraine.
His Holiness mentioned that while there is a lot of enthusiasm among the Ukrainian armed forces, a lack of lethal weapons makes it hard for the Ukrainian soldiers to defend their land.
Much of the weapons that are currently in possession of the Ukrainian military are outdated.
Ukrainian armed forces have to use old Soviet-era equipment to battle Russian forces.
It could lead to more aggression and even World War III since it seems unlikely that Putin will stop after he seizes Donbass.
Some would question the right of a religious figure to even ask the USA for weapons, His Holiness stresses that he is not a politician, and he hopes that knowing that Ukraine has real support from the West, could possibly cause Russia to rethink its actions and eventually bring peace to the region.
He talked about the tension that exists between the Kyivan Patriarchate and the Moscow Patriarchate.
Unfortunately, the Moscow Patriarchate has had a great influence on some people in Ukraine, especially in the eastern parts of the country and Crimea, which led to the destruction of this base and a major misunderstanding between people living in different parts of Ukraine.
At the moment there is no religious freedom in Donbass, and churches that belong to the Moscow Patriarchate, are the only religious institutions that still function in that area.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyivan Patriarchate, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine and Protestant churches in Ukraine have all shown support for the Ukrainian armed forces.
Another great point made by His Holiness, Patriarch Filaret, was that Russia is not the biggest enemy of Ukraine at the moment.
Unfortunately, even after the Revolution of Dignity, there are still some members of Verkhovna Rada as well as representatives of local administration in different cities and towns in Ukraine, who belong to the old Ukrainian political system that could be characterized by an extremely high level of corruption.
Rebuilding and reforming the system in just one year is impossible, which means that Ukraine still struggles with its biggest enemy.
Hopefully, Ukraine can defeat this enemy and transition to being a thriving democracy.
It was a prayer for peace, a prayer for Ukraine, a prayer for all of us.
Opinions expressed herein are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation.
Patriarch Filaret, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate, came to Washington to attend the National Prayer Breakfast.
And like a year before, His Holiness paid a visit to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation to meet with Friends of Ukraine.
Below, I summarize my impressions from the Patriarch's public appearances, both at our meeting at USUF and elsewhere in the Nation's Capital.
An audience of political experts at the Atlantic Council listened to him intently for over an hour and gave him a round of applause in the end.
A year ago, during the Maidan protests, Patriarch Filaret famously said, ""The church must be out of politics.
Michael's Cathedral a temple of the Kyiv Patriarchate nearest to Maidan gave refuge to young protesters beaten by riot police at the start of the anti-Yanukovych revolution.
In those soulful conversations, he holistically connects questions of faith with citizen virtues.
We must hate Putin's aggression, for it is an evil and sinful deed, explains the Patriarch; but we can pray for Putin's soul asking God to forgive this sinner.
We do not claim a role in politics, he said, but we understand that people are driven by ideas, and in the domain of ideas they can seek guidance from church to distinguish between truth and lies.
The Patriarch eagerly discussed political history as a source of moral lessons.
Moscow's idea of Rusky Mir is an example of lies and falsehood; nice packaging for the idea of a new Russian empire.
The Patriarch also spoke at length comparing Hitler's course to World War II with Putin's course today.
He emphasized that both Hitler and Putin used lies to cover their aggressive aspirations, and that Western powers must not make the same mistake again.
He also stressed that Ukraine, by confronting the Russian aggressor, was defending not only itself, but the rest of the world as well.
He continuously reminded about security assurances given to Ukraine when it was dismantling its nuclear arsenals.
As the Patriarch pointed out, helping Ukraine with defensive weapons now is the right moral choice for the U.S.; but besides, that choice must also be driven by concerns of international security and the need to save international trust in the United States.
In late Soviet days, he used his considerable influence to gain an autonomous status for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church; yet, when he pressed for its full independence , this caused a bitter conflict with Moscow.
Looking back at Ukraine's post-Soviet history, one can view that as a step of providence.
For more than two decades after that, Ukraine's politics was plagued by ""the creole syndrome"" of uncertainty and ambiguity in relations with Moscow.
But Filaret resolved that uncertainty for himself and his followers when breaking off from Moscow in 1992.
That act of great moral courage may be seen, in fact, as a precursor of the break up with Moscow that took place in the minds and souls of millions in 2014.
In due time, history will fully appraise how much Filaret has done for his country.
Since 2004, UOCMP became an openly ""anti-Orange"" political player in Ukraine.
Filaret quoted statistics showing that over 50% of the Orthodox faithful attend the temples of the Kyiv Patriarchate, whereas UOCMP has only a third of them.
However, UOCMP has a bigger number of registered parishes because, said Filaret, under President Kuchma the government wanted to register a UOMCP charter in every village across the country.
It is not surprising that people would like to switch from the Moscow Patriarchate to the Kyiv Patriarchate, said Filaret.
They can do this easily in cities where there are temples of both denominations and that is how this should be.
Conflicts and animosity arise only if there is but one temple in a village, and the community is divided.
But the situation would change as soon as the Ecumenical Patriarch officially recognizes the Kyiv Patriarchate as an autocephalous church.
In that case, according to Filaret, big numbers of parishes, with their clergy and faithful, would switch from Moscow to Kyiv.
Once there is a united autocephalous Orthodox Church in Ukraine, it will easily surpass the Russian Orthodox Church in size and influence.
Accordingly, the ROC has about 12 thousand parishes and 67 dioceses, while in Ukraine there are 15 thousand Orthodox parishes and 87 dioceses.
If the two Ukrainian churches unite, Russia will cease to be world's biggest nation of the Orthodox Christian faith.
The Patriarch is convinced that the European choice of the Ukrainian people means an important role for the church in defining the nation's new European identity.
He emphasizes that the European values are deeply linked to traditional Christian values.
Christian faith and Christian values, according to him, must help in creating a united Europe that would have enough power to stop and defeat an aggressive adversary who tries to challenge those European values like, for instance, Vladimir Putin.

Washington, DC, Dec 18, 2014 We have all been following the crisis and war events in Ukraine for over a year now.
Being far from the place where the events happen makes it hard at times to figure out what exactly is going on.
That is the reason why, given a chance, we try to talk to someone who has recently visited Ukraine, or lives there, and has a chance to communicate with policymakers and others, regarding the newest and most dramatic events shaping Ukraine's history.
We had a chance to talk today about Ukraine with our very special guest, Mykola Vorobiov, a Ukrainian journalist, who had spent nearly two months reporting on the fighting in Eastern Ukraine.
In his presentation, Mykola provided an overview of what he saw in the field and described the current situation in Ukraine.
Much of Mykola's presentation was devoted to information, including statistics, on both sides of the conflict.
He informed us about Ukrainian volunteer battalions and their leaders, as well as his journalistic coverage on who is fighting on the pro-Russian side.
Mykola also talked about some of the mistakes that were made during the fighting, including the Battle of Ilovaisk, which resulted in many casualties.
Many of them were quite well informed about the situation in Ukraine, which resulted in a very interesting and beneficial discussion on the current events in Ukraine.
November 14, 2014 A group of ""field commanders"" of Ukraine's volunteer outfits attended a round-table discussion at the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation today.
They are known as the heroes who saved the country from a military defeat last summer in the face of Russia's invasion.
The celebrated guests met with a stellar panel of experts and civic leaders who comprise the Friends of Ukraine network in the Nation's Capital.
The ""field commanders"" delegation was led by two legendary figures, Andriy Teteruk and Yury Bereza.
They are a part of the ""new political class"" that is the embodiment of the country's hope for change.
Arguably, it was owing to such candidates as Teteruk and Bereza that the party they represented Popular Front was able to gain twice more votes than predicted and even win a plurality in party lists' competition last month.
At that time, Ukraine's army was not prepared to fight back an invasion from Russia neither logistically, nor psychologically.
But patriotic volunteers organized their own ""battalions"" , and those formations spearheaded the resistance effort.
It is a misconception, however, to see their fight as an ""amateur"" effort.
In reality, both Andriy Teteruk and Yury Bereza were career military officers who chose an early discharge from active duty.
The field commanders are in Washington to call for continued and expanded United States support to Ukraine.
At this time, the Russian side fights with newer and more advanced weapon systems, with more fire power and better targeting capabilities.
They were less savvy on issues of world politics that some United States experts were raising in the discussion.
Concurrently with the discussion hosted by the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, the same issues were discussed by world leaders who met in Australia for the G20 summit.
Vladimir Putin received a strong signal there that should caution him from attempts to re-heat the military conflict in which Ukrainian soldiers continue to die almost every day.
Another powerful signal should be a promise of the United States to supply some weapons systems to Ukraine which is a possible outcome of Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Ukraine this week.
Moderator Konstantin Avramov, Program Director at the Center on Global Interests, is seated in the middle.
The 2+ hour meeting included such organizations as the Center for US-Ukrainian Relations, U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, Razom, The Washington Group, Ukrainian Congress Committee of America/UNIS Office, Ukrainian National Women's League of America , U.S.-Ukraine Foundation and others.
