And they went further""Ukraine's former President Viktor Yanukovych has said he accepts some responsibility for the killings that led to his overthrow in February 2014.
I did not give any orders , that was not my authorityâ€¦ I was against any use of force, let alone the use of firearms, I was against bloodshed.
The Maidan in central Kiev became a battlefieldCrimea 'tragedy'Within weeks Russian troops in unmarked camouflage took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea.
Then in April pro-Russian rebels stormed government buildings in the heavily industrial Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, triggering civil war.Mr Yanukovych told the BBC that the war was a ""nightmare"" that had become a reality.
Russia's annexation of Crimea was a ""tragedy"", which would not have happened on his watch, he said.
He denied allegations that he had embezzled funds from the Ukrainian state and was hiding money in foreign bank accounts.
His opulent residence outside Kiev, thrown open to public gaze by protesters after he fled, did not belong to him personally, he said.
Receipts detailing millions of dollars spent on the complex were, he said, ""political technology"" and spin.
But a year and a half has passed, those in power have all the means at their disposal.

The Donbas region much of which is now controlled by separatists should remain part of Ukraine, he said, urging the United States and the European Union to force Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebel leaders.
