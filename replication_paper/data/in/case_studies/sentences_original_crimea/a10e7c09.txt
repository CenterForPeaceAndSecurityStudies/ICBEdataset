Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin ; born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician and former intelligence officer serving as President of Russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 until 2008.
In between his presidential terms he was also the Prime Minister of Russia under his close associate Dmitry Medvedev.
He was one of a few in the class of approximately 45 pupils who was not yet a member of the Young Pioneer organization.
He wished to emulate the intelligence officers portrayed in Soviet cinema.
In June 1996 Sobchak lost his bid for reelection in Saint Petersburg, so Putin moved to Moscow and was appointed as Deputy Chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin.
In 2014 Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian territory.
After the Euromaidan protests and the fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.
Russia then annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum in which Crimeans voted to join the Russian Federation, according to official results.
Subsequently, demonstrations by pro-Russian groups in the Donbass area of Ukraine escalated into an armed conflict between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.
In August Russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of Donetsk Oblast.
The incursion by the Russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.
Many members of the international community assumed that Putin's annexation of Crimea had initiated a completely new kind of Russian foreign policy.
They took the annexation of Crimea to mean that his foreign policy had shifted ""from state-driven foreign policy"" to taking an offensive stance to re-create the Soviet Union.
However, this policy shift can be understood as Putin trying to defend nations in Russia's sphere of influence from encroaching western power.
While the act to annex the Crimea was bold and drastic, his ""new"" foreign policy may have more similarities to his older policies.
As president and prime-minister, Putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country.
A massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US$1 billion and dubbed ""Putin's Palace"" is under construction near the Black Sea village of Praskoveevka.
The mansion, built on government land and sporting 3 helipads, and a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official Kremlin guard service, is said to have been built for Putin's private use.
In 2012 Sergei Kolesnikov, a former business associate of Putin's, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he had been ordered by Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace.
It is intended to be a formal alliance between the ruling party and numerous Russian nongovernmental organizations.
