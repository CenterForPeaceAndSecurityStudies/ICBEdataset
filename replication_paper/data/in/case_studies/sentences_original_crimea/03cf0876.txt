Poroshenko stresses need not to let Russia ""spill its aggression into Azov Sea"" Poroshenko stressed Russia's attack in the Kerch Strait and the Black Sea on November 25 was not an isolated incident.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has stressed the need not to allow Russia to spill its aggression into the Sea of Azov.
And an 'Azov package of sanctions' against Russia would be the least the world should respond with this time.
In 2014, for the first time in seven decades, a state sought to redraw Europe's map by way of military aggression, he said.
Four years ago, in the aftermath of our revolution, Ukraine alone was not able to withstand a Russian military adventure.
But today our resolve is strong, and we are prepared to stand up to Russia.
This is why I have enacted limited martial law in Ukrainian territory near the Russian border, so that we are able to mobilize and protect our security should Russia dare to intensify its aggression.
But we also need the support of the international community in the form of further sanctions against Moscow for its latest assault,"" the president said.
Jobs have been lost, livelihoods destroyed, food is being wasted, and goods intended for Europe and the Middle East delayed.
The words of Western condemnation this fall have only worsened Russia's behavior,"" he said.
Poroshenko says Ukraine's ships never aggressed Russia's Navy, never opened fire despite being goaded, were attacked with gunfire and missiles, and were seized while sailing home in international waters.
Moscow did not hide behind 'little green men' as it did in Crimea in 2014 or its servicemen on 'vacation' as it claimed when hostilities started in Eastern Ukraine the same year.
These are not just Ukrainian ships; they carry the flags of other countries and they have effectively been commandeered by Russia,"" Poroshenko added.
