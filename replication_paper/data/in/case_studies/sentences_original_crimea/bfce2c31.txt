Washington has appointed former ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker as a special representative to Ukraine.
The move comes less than three months after the United States expressed doubt that the Ukrainian conflict was a point of interest for American taxpayers.
Volker “will take responsibility for advancing United States efforts to achieve the objectives set out in the Minsk agreements.
Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko greeted Volker’s appointment on his Twitter feed.
The rhetoric is remarkably different from three months ago, when while at a G7 meeting in Italy Tillerson questioned why United States taxpayers should be interested in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian crisis has become a particularly thorny issue in Russian-US relations since the Kiev government was overthrown in 2014.
Kiev and its Western backers accuse Russia of supporting rebel forces in eastern Ukraine, who do not recognize the post-coup government.
Moscow has repeatedly said the Ukraine crisis is an internal conflict and that Kiev is not fulfilling its part of the Minsk agreements and refusing to negotiate with its own people in Donbass.
The United States imposed sanctions against Russia, with the latest expansion in late June, after Russia’s reunification with Crimea following a 2014 referendum.
Washington calls it an “annexation” and says that the sanctions will not be lifted until the peninsula becomes part of Ukraine again.
The situation in Ukraine and its resolution were expected to be on the agenda during the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and Trump in Hamburg on Friday.
Prior to the event, the Kremlin stressed that the meeting was “a great opportunity to repeat the Russian position” and emphasize the necessity to implement the Minsk agreements.
However, the Russian president would not have an opportunity to fully express his understanding of the Ukrainian conflict and its causes as the leaders would lack time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted.
