Pavel Rebrov, Reuters | The Russian guided-missile frigate Admiral Makarov arrives at the Bay of Sevastopol to join Russia's Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea, on October 5, 2018.
The Russian military announced on Wednesday it was deploying new missiles as part of its plan to boost defences in the occupied peninsula of Crimea in the wake of a fresh flare-up of tension with Ukraine.
Vadim Astafyev, the top Defence Ministry official in Russia's south, as saying that Russia will add one S-400 anti-aircraft missile system to the three already deployed in the peninsula.
The strait links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov and is where Russia has built a long new bridge – the only land link between Crimea and the Russian mainland.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday broke his silence on the maritime clash, blaming it on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's desire to get re-elected.
The Kremlin added that Putin rebuffed a request by Poroshenko to speak by phone about Moscow’s seizure of the Ukrainian navy ships and their crews.
As Russian Tsar, as he sees himself, his empire can't function without Ukraine.
Ukraine has released what it said was the exact location where its ships were fired on Sunday by Russia, showing that they were in international waters approaching Kerch Strait from the west, not from the east, as Putin suggested.
Poroshenko called on NATO members including Germany to send naval vessels to the Sea of Azov to back his country in the standoff.
Ukraine's president on Wednesday signed an act imposing martial law for 30 days in 10 regions bordering Russia, the Black Sea and the Azov Sea.
