The invasion caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with more than 7.7 million Ukrainians fleeing the country and a third of the population displaced.
The invasion also caused global food shortages.In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine, consisting of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, sparking a regional war.
In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops and their equipment.
In a televised address shortly before the invasion, Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to statehood, and falsely claimed Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority.
On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed breakaway statelets in Donbas controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
The following day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force, and Russian troops overtly entered both territories.The invasion began on the morning of 24 February, when Putin announced a ""special military operation"" to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.
Minutes later, missiles and airstrikes hit across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv.
Zelenskyy enacted martial law and a general mobilisation of all male Ukrainian citizens between 18 and 60, who were banned from leaving the country.
At the start of the invasion, Russian attacks were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Amidst heavy losses and strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian troops retreated from Kyiv Oblast by 3 April.
The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full withdrawal of Russian forces.
The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia.
The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in Ukraine since 2013, as well as war crimes in the 2022 invasion. .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents 1 Background since Ukrainian independence 2 Prelude 2.
Russia–Ukraine relations, Orange Revolution, Revolution of Dignity, and Russo-Ukrainian War Further information: Historical background of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine and Russian imperialism Protesters in Independence Square in Kyiv during the Orange Revolution, November 2004 After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the newly independent republics of Ukraine and Russia maintained ties.
Russian leaders claimed Western powers pledged that NATO would not expand eastward, although this is disputed.
Ukraine, with the annexed Crimea at bottom and two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Donbas at right Following the Euromaidan protests and a revolution resulting in the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014, pro-Russian unrest erupted in parts of Ukraine.
Russian soldiers without insignia took control of strategic positions and infrastructure in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament.
Russia organized a controversial referendum, whose outcome was for Crimea to join Russia.
The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.
Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.
The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land, including the unrecognised Novorossiya.
Prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Russian military buildups United States paratroopers of 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment depart Italy's Aviano Air Base for Latvia, 23 February 2022.
Thousands of United States troops were deployed to Eastern Europe amid Russia's military build-up.
In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border.
A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.
Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine; including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,Russian ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022, and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.
Putin's chief national security adviser, Nikolai Patrushev, believed that the West had been in an undeclared war with Russia for years.
Sources say the decision to invade Ukraine was made by Putin and a small group of war hawks in Putin's inner circle, including Patrushev and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.When in early December 2021 Russia denied plans to invade, the United States released intelligence, including satellite photographs of Russian troops and equipment near the Russo-Ukrainian border, that indicated otherwise, and continued to accurately predict invasion events.
The intelligence also said that the Russians had a list of key sites, and of individuals to be killed or neutralised in the invasion.
Disinformation in the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis See also: Russian opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership and Humanitarian situation during the war in Donbas On 10 January 2022, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna and NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg spoke to media about the prospect of a Russian invasion.
In the months preceding the invasion, Russian officials accused Ukraine of Russophobia, inciting tensions, and repressing Russian speakers in Ukraine.
Commentators and Western officials described these as attempts to justify war.
Putin's claims about ""de-Nazification"" have been described as absurd, and Russian claims of genocide were widely rejected as baseless.
Both Lavrov and Putin were criticized by United States Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt for their weaponization of nazism and of the holocaust as being racially prejudiced when she stated that Lavrov's use of referring to Hitler's mother as Jewish and therefor inferring that Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves was caustic by Lavrov in its direct inferences.
Lipstadt similarly criticized the two Russian leaders for their weaponization of the term nazism for their own self-interest.
Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, rebuked Putin's allegations, noting that his grandfather served in the Soviet army fighting Nazis.
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem condemned this use of Holocaust history and allusion to Nazi ideology in propaganda.
Vladimir Putin and his long-time confidant Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.
During the second build-up, Russia demanded that the United States and NATO enter into a legally binding arrangement preventing Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and remove multinational forces from NATO's Eastern European member states.
These demands were widely seen as non-viable; new NATO members in Central and Eastern Europe had joined the alliance because they preferred the safety and economic opportunities offered by NATO and the EU, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.
A formal treaty to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO would contravene the treaty's ""open door"" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz made efforts to prevent the war in February.
Macron met with Putin but failed to convince him not to go forward with the attack.
Scholz warned Putin about heavy sanctions that would be imposed should the invasion happen.
Scholz also pleaded with Zelensky to renounce the aspiration to join NATO and declare neutrality, however Zelensky refused it.
Timeline of the war in Donbas Fighting in Donbas escalated after 17 February 2022.
Ukraine and Donbas each accused the other of firing across the line of conflict.
On 18 February, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics ordered all civilians to leave their capitals, Ukrainian media described a sharp increase in artillery shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas as an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army.
On 19 February both separatist republics declared full mobilisation.In the days leading up to the invasion, the Russian government intensified a disinformation campaign intended to mute public criticism.
Russian state media promoted fabricated videos that purported to show Ukrainian forces attacking Russians in Donbas; evidence showed that the purported attacks, explosions, and evacuations were staged by Russia.
On 21 February, the head of the Russian Federal Security Service said that Russian forces had killed five Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" that had crossed into Russian territory, captured one Ukrainian serviceman and destroyed two armoured vehicles.
Ukraine denied this, and warned that Russia sought a pretext for an invasion.
Escalation Putin's address to the nation on 21 February On 21 February, The Russian government recognised the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.
Several members of the UN Security Council condemned the 21 February intervention in Donbas; none voiced support.
On 22 February, video footage shot in the early morning showed Russian armed forces and tanks moving in the Donbas region.
The Federation Council authorised the use of military force outside Russia.
Zelenskyy called up army reservists; and Ukraine's parliament proclaimed a 30-day national state of emergency.
Ukraine's Security Service denied reports of Chinese military espionage on the eve of the invasion, including on nuclear infrastructure.On 23 February, Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian, appealing to Russian citizens to prevent war.
He refuted Russian claims of neo-Nazis in the Ukrainian government and said that he had no intention of attacking Donbas.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on 23 February that separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk had sent Putin a letter saying that Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian deaths and appealing for military support from Russia.
Half an hour into the emergency meeting, Putin announced the start of military operations in Ukraine.
Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian representative, called on the Russian representative, Vasily Nebenzya, to ""do everything possible to stop the war"" or relinquish his position as president of the UN Security Council; Nebenzya refused.
In his speech, Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukrainian territory and that he supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.
Putin said that Russia sought ""demilitarisation and denazification"" of Ukraine.
Within minutes of Putin's announcement, explosions were reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and the Donbas region.
An alleged leaked report from within the FSB claimed that the intelligence agency was not warned of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.
Immediately following the attack, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine.
The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old who were prohibited from leaving the country.
Russian troops entered Ukraine from the north in Belarus ; from the north-east in Russia ; from the east in the DPR and the Luhansk People's Republic; and from the south in Crimea.
Russian equipment and vehicles were marked with a white Z military symbol , believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.

Kyiv offensive , Northeastern Ukraine offensive, Eastern Ukraine offensive, and Southern Ukraine offensive See also: Order of battle for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine This section needs to be updated.
Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.
Military control around Kyiv on 2 April 2022 The invasion began on 24 February, with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.
The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearhead incursions, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv, a southern front originating in Crimea, a south-eastern front launched at the cities of Luhansk and Donbas, and an eastern front.
Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine reached as far west as Lviv.Wagner Group mercenaries and Chechen forces reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The ""first stage"" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus, conducted by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies.
A second axis deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District , comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.
A third axis deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District , with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army.
The north-eastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to south-eastern Ukraine.
By 8 April, General Alexander Dvornikov was placed in charge of military operations during the invasion.
On 18 April, retired Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, the former United States ambassador to NATO, reported in a PBS NewsHour interview that Russia had repositioned its troops to initiate a new assault on Eastern Ukraine which would be limited to Russia's original deployment of 150,000 to 190,000 troops for the invasion, though the troops were being well supplied from adequate weapon stockpiles in Russia.
For Lute, this contrasted sharply with the vast size of the Ukrainian conscription of all-male Ukrainian citizens between 16 and 60 years of age, but without adequate weapons in Ukraine's highly limited stockpiles of weapons.
On 26 April, delegates of the USA and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss forming a coalition to provide economic support and military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.
Following Putin's Victory Day speech in early May, United States Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.Russian forces improved their focus on protecting their supply lines by advancing more slowly, and more methodically.
Ukraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained it, as Western countries feared that Ukraine would use it to strike targets in Russia.
Military experts disagree on the future of the conflict; some have suggested trading territory for peace, while others believe that Ukraine can sustain their resistance to the invasion, due to the Russian losses.
On 26 May 2022, the Conflict Intelligence Team, citing Russian soldiers, reported that Colonel General Gennady Zhidko had been put in charge of Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, replacing Army General Dvornikov.
By 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent.
In response to Biden's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin indicated that Russian would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine and in apparent retribution ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.
Invasion of Ukraine 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine Phase 1 from 24 February to 7 April 2022 The invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv.
The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.
Capture of Chernobyl, Battle of Kyiv , and Bucha massacre Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River, apparently to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and the eastern at Sumy.
These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the north-east and east.Russia apparently tried to rapidly seize Kyiv, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but was unsuccessful.
Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost towns of Chernobyl and Pripyat.Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport, And a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.By early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.
As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.
Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March, though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.
On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.
Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.On 25 March, an Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including Makariv.
Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.
On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian ""retraction, resupply, and redeployment"" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on Eastern Ukraine.Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes.
One did occur during the 28 April visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres to discuss with Zelenskyy the survivors of the siege of Mariupol.
Siege of Chernihiv and Battle of Sumy See also: Russian occupation of Sumy Oblast Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February and besieged its administrative capital.
A separate advance into Sumy Oblast the same day attacked the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres from the Russo-Ukrainian border.
Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.
On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.
Siege of Mariupol, 2022 bombing of Odessa, Battle of Kherson, and Battle of Enerhodar See also: Russian occupation of Kherson Oblast and Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast A destroyed Russian BMP-3 near Mariupol, 7 March On 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper, cut off since 2014.
On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east towards the city, linking to separatist-held Donbas.
On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR moves on Mariupol and were defeated near Pavlopil.
By evening, the Russian Navy reportedly began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres west of Mariupol.
A United States defence official said that Russian forces might be deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead.The Russian 22nd Army Corps approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on 26 February and besieged Enerhodar to take control of it.
A fire began, but the International Atomic Energy Agency subsequently said that essential equipment was undamaged.
The nuclear power plant fell under Russian control but despite the fires, it recorded no radiation leaks.A third Russian attack group from Crimea moved northwest and captured bridges over the Dnieper.
On 2 March, Russian troops won a battle at Kherson the first major city to fall to Russian forces in the invasion.
Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv and attacked it two days later, but were repelled by Ukrainian forces.
Also on 2 March, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka, controlled by the DPR since 2014.
After renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.
By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.
Putin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.On 1 April Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.
On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on Southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odessa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
Battle of Kharkiv , Battle of Izium , and Millerovo air base attack See also: Russian occupation of Kharkiv Oblast Russian bombardment on the outskirts of Kharkiv, 1 March In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres from the Russian border, and met strong Ukrainian resistance.
On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire.
On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha.
On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city.Izium was reportedly captured by Russian forces on 17 March, although fighting continued.On 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in Eastern Ukraine.
On 31 March, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control, and PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.
By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2–3 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.
South-eastern offensive 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine Phase 2 from 7 April to 10 June 2022 On 8 April, the Russian ministry announced that all troops and divisions in south-eastern Ukraine would unite under General Aleksandr Dvornikov, who was placed in charge of combined military operations, including the units redeployed from the northern front and north-eastern fronts.
By 17 April, Russian progress on the south-eastern front appeared to be impeded by troops continuing to hold out in an abandoned steel mill in Mariupol and refusing to surrender.
Battle of Donbas Further information: Battle of Kharkiv , Kramatorsk railway station attack, and Battle of Sievierodonetsk See also: Russian occupation of Kharkiv Oblast Military control around Donbas as of 31 May 2022 A Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 and injuring 87 to 300.
On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.
American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the south-eastern Ukraine front.
Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its north-eastern troops to the south-eastern front of the invasion.On 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy.
On 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.
On 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.
On 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of Lyman, fully capturing the city by 26 May.
On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.
By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 percent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.
On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk.
By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20% or more of the city had been recaptured.
With the Ukrainian defenses of Severodonetsk faultering, Russian invasion troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighboring city of Lysychansk as their next target city in the invasion.
On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Severodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages and hamlets surrounding the city, most recently the village of Metelkine.
On 22 April, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolayiv–Odessa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova.
Georgi Gotev, writing for Reuters on 22 April, noted that occupying Ukraine from Odessa to Transnistria would transform it into a landlocked nation without any practical access to the Black Sea.
On 24 April, Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odessa, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties.On 27 April, Ukrainian sources indicated that explosions had destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria, primarily used to rebroadcast Russian television programming.
At the end of April, Russia renewed missile attacks on runways in Odessa, destroying some of them.
Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast Russian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.
On 10 April, Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport.
Siege of Mariupol On 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal iron and steel works in Mariupol, and the Ukrainian defence forces that remained there.
Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.
On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.
On 6 May, The Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy had authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.
Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainskaya Pravda on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian Marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled.
The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.
On 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had ""fulfilled its combat mission"" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun.
Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol.
Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment.
Western Ukraine On 14 March, Russian forces conducted multiple cruise missile attacks on a military training facility in Yavoriv, Lviv Oblast, close to the Polish border.
Local governor Maksym Kozytskyy reported that at least 35 people had been killed.
On 18 March, Russia expanded the attack to Lviv, with Ukrainian military officials saying initial information suggested that the missiles which hit Lviv were likely air-launched cruise missiles originating from warplanes flying over the Black Sea.
On 16 May, United States defense officials say that in the previous 24 hours Russians fired long range missiles targeting military training facility near Lviv.
List of aircraft losses during the Russo-Ukrainian War On 24 February, Russian forces attacked the Chuhuiv air base, which housed Bayraktar TB2 drones.
On 27 February, Russia reportedly fired 9K720 Iskander missiles from Belarus at the civilian Zhytomyr Airport.
Many Ukrainian air defence facilities were destroyed or damaged in the first days of the invasion by Russian air strikes.
In the opening days of the conflict, Russia fired many cruise and ballistic missiles at the principal Ukrainian ground-based early warning radars, thereby blinding the Ukrainian Air Force to their air activity.
Additionally, craters in the operating surfaces at the major Ukrainian air bases hindered Ukrainian aircraft movements, and several Ukrainian long-range S-300P surface-to-air missile batteries were destroyed.On 1 March, Russia and the United States established a deconfliction line to avoid any misunderstanding that could cause an unintentional escalation.Russia lost at least ten aircraft on 5 March.
On 6 March, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that 88 Russian aircraft had been destroyed since the war began.
However, an anonymous senior United States defence official told Reuters on 7 March that Russia still had the ""vast majority"" of its fighter jets and helicopters that had been amassed near Ukraine available to fly.
After the first month of the invasion, Justin Bronk, a British military observer, counted the Russian aircraft losses at 15 fixed-wing aircraft and 35 helicopters, but noted that the true total was certainly higher.
Local governor Maksym Kozytskyy reported that at least 35 people had been killed in the attacks.
The poor performance of the Russian Air Force has been attributed by The Economist to Russia's inability to suppress Ukraine's medium-range surface-to-air missile batteries and Russia's lack of precision-guided bombs.
Ukrainian mid-range SAM sites force planes to fly low, making them vulnerable to Stinger and other shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, and lack of training and flight hours for Russian pilots renders them inexperienced for the type of close ground support missions typical of modern air forces.
Western commentators, noted the qualitative and quantative advantages the Russian air Force had over its Ukrainian counterpart but attributed the poor performance of Russian aviation to the extensive ground-based anti-aircraft capabilities of the Ukrainians.
List of ship losses during the Russo-Ukrainian War Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva sunk on 14 April 2022, reportedly after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles Ukraine lies on the Black Sea, which only has access through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits.
On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships not registered to Black Sea home bases and not returning to their ports of origin.
This prevented the passage of four Russian naval vessels through the Turkish Straits.
On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that an attack on Snake Island by Russian Navy ships had begun.
The guided missile cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with their deck guns.
After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island.Russia stated on 26 February that United States drones supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help target Russian warships in the Black Sea, which the United States denied.
By 3 March, the Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, was scuttled in Mykolaiv to prevent its capture by Russian forces.
On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing ship Yuri Olefirenko.
On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk – initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov – was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.
On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles long and 3 miles wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters south-east of Odesa.
Ukraine closed its ports at MARSEC level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.The Russian cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a United States senior official, hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship on fire.
The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the warship had suffered serious damage due to a munition explosion caused by a fire, and said that its entire crew had been evacuated.The Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.
Later on the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.
On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.In early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island.
The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to have repelled these counterattacks.
Ukraine released footage of a Russian Serna-class landing craft located in the Black Sea being destroyed near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.
On 22 April, it was reported that Russia was continuing to test its RS-28 Sarmat long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles to upgrade its nuclear arsenal in Autumn of 2022 with Putin stating that other nations should be more wary of Russia's nuclear arsenal.
On 24 April, in apparent response to Biden sending Antony Blinken to Kyiv for military support meetings with Zelenskyy on 23 April, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that further support of Ukraine could cause tensions which could potentially lead to a World War III scenario involving Russia's full arsenal of weapons.
In apparent response to Germany deploying armed tanks to Ukraine, Putin announced in Russia's main legislative assembly that Russia would respond to any combative military provocation from outside of Ukraine with prompt peremptory action possible only with Russia's unique arsenal of nuclear weapons.
Pentagon Press secretary John Kirby, after announcing the successful delivery of a large deployment of M777 howitzer cannons to Ukraine, called Putin's assertion of nuclear potency contrary to the process of the peaceful resolution of the current conflict in Ukraine.
On 29 May, after repudiating accusations made against Russia regarding atrocities in Bucha, Andrei Kelin in an interview with the BBC tried to walkback earlier Russian comments about the use of nuclear arms by stating that Russian presently had no plans for using them unless Russian sovereignty was found to be in peril.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that Japan would support further international discussion about Russia and its nuclear arms threats during the invasion of Ukraine at the upcoming nuclear non-proliferation meeting taking place next August.
Responding to a call from Ukraine's transportation agency, Ukravtodor, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.
Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.
By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country.
The Ukrainian military announced plans to launch a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence against the Russian invasion.People physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.
The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters to firing into the air or directly into crowds.
There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killing, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.
In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killing a civilian found with pictures of Russian tanks.As of 21 May, President Zelensky indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 servicemembers on active duty combatting the Russian invasion.

Russia Ukraine Countries that have supplied Ukraine with military equipment during the 2022 invasion Russia Ukraine Countries sending any aid, including humanitarian aid, to Ukraine Since 2014, the UK, US, EU, and NATO have provided mostly non-lethal military aid to Ukraine.
The United States began to sell weapons including Javelin anti-tank missiles starting in 2018, and Ukraine agreed to purchase TB2 combat drones from Turkey in 2019.
Russia built up equipment and troops on Ukraine's borders in January 2022.
The United States worked with other NATO member states to transfer US-produced weapons to Ukraine.
The UK also began to supply Ukraine with NLAW and Javelin anti-tank weapons.
After the invasion, NATO member states including Germany agreed to supply weapons, but NATO as an organisation did not.
NATO and its members also refused to send troops into Ukraine, or to establish a no fly-zone, lest this spark a larger-scale war, a decision some labelled appeasement.On 26 February, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $350 million in lethal military assistance, including anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.
The next day the EU stated that it would purchase €450 million in lethal assistance and an additional €50 million in non-lethal supplies for Ukraine, with Poland handling distribution.
During the first week of the invasion, NATO member states supplied more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine; by mid-March, the number was estimated to be more than 20,000.
In three tranches agreed in February, March and April 2022, the European Union committed to €1.5 billion to support the capabilities and resilience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the protection of the Ukrainian civilian population, under the purview of the European Peace Facility line.As of 11 April, Ukraine had been provided with approximately 25,000 anti-air and 60,000 anti-tank weapon systems by the United States and its allies.
The following day, Russia reportedly received anti-tank missiles and RPGs from Iran, supplied through undercover networks via Iraq.On 19 April 2022 Romania announced a planned reform to the government decree that regulates the export of military weapons and national defence products in order to provide these weapons not only to NATO allies but also to Ukraine.
The Ministry of Defense developed the draft decree which states that the reason behind this decision was Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
However, on 27 April Defense Minister Vasile Dincu said that his plan had been discontinued.On 26 April, the United States convened a conference in which representatives of more than 40 countries met at the Ramstein Air Base to discuss military support for Ukraine.On 28 April, United States President Biden asked Congress for an additional $33 billion to assist Ukraine, including $20 billion to provide weapons to Ukraine.
On 5 May, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced that Ukraine had received more than $12 billion worth of weapons and financial aid from Western countries since the start of Russia's invasion on 24 February.
On 10 May, the House passed legislation that would provide $40 billion in new aid to Ukraine.
After the legislation was approved by the Senate, Biden signed the legislation on 21 May.On 30 May French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna announced the provision to Ukraine of additional CAESAR self-propelled howitzer self-propelled howitzer systems, mounted on the Renault Sherpa 5 6×6 chassis.
On May 25, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny said that the first batch was already on the front lines fighting the invader.
On 10 June the AFU demonstrated the combat systems to representatives from the press; by that date the Ukrainian gunners had possession of 18 CAESAR units.On 31 May the White House informed the press that the United States would be supplying HIMARS multiple launch rocket system to Ukraine.
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl stated that the United States would be able to send more systems as the fighting evolves.On 5 June Spain offered to donate to Ukraine 40 surplus Leopard 2 German-built third-generation tanks, pending approval from Olaf Scholz.
The official said the Russians had transformed the war into an artillery duel focused on the southeast of the country.
On 13 June a Deutsche Welle correspondent said that the Ukrainian supply of Soviet-era ammunition had been exhausted and all they had as a dwindling supply obtained from friendly ex-Soviet countries.
International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine Although NATO and the EU have taken a strict policy of ""no boots on the ground"" in support against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine has actively sought volunteers from other countries.
On 1 March, Ukraine temporarily lifted visa requirements for foreign volunteers who wished to join the fight against Russian forces.
Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba stated that as of 6 March, approximately 20,000 foreign nationals from 52 countries have volunteered to fight.
Most of these volunteers joined the newly created International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine.On 3 March, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov warned that mercenaries are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions, and captured foreign fighters would not be considered prisoners of war, but prosecuted as criminals.
Shortly thereafter, however, on 11 March, Moscow announced that 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East were ready to join other pro-Russian foreign fighters alongside the Donbas separatists.
A video uploaded online showed armed Central African paramilitaries calling to arms to fight in Ukraine with Russian troops.
On 5 May, a United States official confirmed that United States gave “a range of intelligence” to assist in the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva.
Both Russian and Ukrainian sources are widely considered to inflate casualty numbers in opposing forces, while downplaying their own losses for the sake of morale.
Both sides also tend to be quieter about their own military fatalities, with Russian news outlets having largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.
Russia and Ukraine admitted to suffering ""significant"" and ""considerable"" losses, respectively.
According to BBC News, Ukrainian claims of Russian fatalities were including the injured as well.AFP, as well as independent conflict monitors, reported that they had not been able to verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses, but suspected they were inflated.The number of civilian and military deaths is impossible to determine with precision given the fog of war.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights considers the number of civilian casualties to be considerably higher than the figure the United Nations are able to certify.On 16 June, the Ukrainian Minister of Defense told CNN that he believed tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died; adding that he ""hoped"" that the true death toll was below 100,000.
Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War § Prisoners of War, and War crimes in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine § Treatment of prisoners of war Official statistics and informed estimates about prisoners of war have varied.
In the initial stages of the invasion, on 24 February, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo Oblast surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.
Subsequently, the first large prisoner exchange took place on 24 March, when 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russian and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.
On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged for an unknown number of Russian troops.On 8 March, a Ukrainian defence reporter with The Kyiv Independent announced that the Ukrainian government was working towards having Russian POWs work to help revive the Ukrainian economy, in full compliance with international law.
In the first weeks of March, human rights organisations called on the Ukrainian government to uphold the rights of Russian prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention and to stop circulating videos of captured Russian soldiers being humiliated or intimidated.
The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine expressed worries about the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war held by forces of Russia and the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.
Videos showing Ukrainian war prisoners being forced to sing pro-Russian songs or carrying bruises attracted concerns about their treatment.
As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion.
In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.In the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently rose to over 7. million by 15 June.
Most refugees were women, children, the elderly, or people with disabilities.
By 20 March, a total of ten million Ukrainians had fled their homes, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the contemporary era.
Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription, unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.
Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, in any case opted to remain in Ukraine to join the resistance.According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, as of 13 May, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.
As of 23 March, over 300,000 refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic.
Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.
The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to ""filtration centers"" in Russian-held territory and thence to Russia, which Ukrainian sources compared to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.
As of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.
RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centers in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine, from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.
By 22 March, it was estimated that between 50,000 and 70,000 high-tech workers had left the country, and that 70,000 to 100,000 more might follow.
Fears arose over the effect of this flight of talent on Russian economic development.
Some joined the Russian resistance to the Putin regime and sought to help Ukraine, and some faced discrimination for being Russian.
On 6 May, The Moscow Times, citing data from the FSB, reported that almost four million Russians had left the country, although this figure does not distinguish between emigres and travellers for business or tourism, etc.
During the 2020/21 international wheat marketing season , it ranked as the sixth-largest wheat exporter, accounting for nine percent of world wheat trade.
The country is also a major global exporter of maize, barley and rapeseed.
In 2020/21, it accounted for 12 percent of global trade in maize and barley and for 14 percent of world rapeseed exports.
Its trade share is even greater in the sunflower oil sector, with the country accounting for about 50 percent of world exports in 2020/2021.
Disruptions to the grain and oilseed sectors of Ukraine were thought inevitable.
On the eve of the invasion, an estimated 6 million tons of wheat and 15 million tons of corn had been readied for export.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , this would cause further loss of life and increase humanitarian needs.
In addition, potential food and fertiliser export difficulties encountered by the Russian Federation, which is a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients, as a result of economic sanctions could jeopardise the food security of many countries.
Rising natural gas prices are pushing agricultural fertiliser prices higher, contributing to increasing food prices globally.
For example Eritrea sourced 47% of its wheat imports in 2021 from Ukraine.
Overall, more than 30 nations depend on Ukraine and Russia for over 30% of their wheat import needs, with many of them located in North Africa, and in Western and Central Asia.A Russian attack damaged the Kozarovychi Dam , which regulates flow from the Kyiv Reservoir, causing flooding along the Irpin River.
A Russian missile attack on Kyiv Dam on the Dnieper River was blocked by Ukrainian defences.
A breach could have triggered flooding of parts of Kyiv, damaged downstream dams, and threatened the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
Russian forces blew up the dam on the North Crimean Canal which Ukraine had erected to block water flow to agricultural lands in Crimea seized by Russia in 2014.
Russians cut civilian water service as part of the Siege of Mariupol.The Ukrainian Defence Ministry accused Russia of stealing ""hundreds of thousands of tonnes of grain"" from grain elevators and other storage facilities throughout occupied Ukraine, and transporting the grain to occupied ports for export.
Substantial quantities of farm equipment, combine harvesters and tractors have also been looted from farms and dealerships and transported to Russia, as far away as Chechnya in some cases.
Theft of grain from occupied regions of Ukraine has the potential to intensify food crises, with both the Ukrainian Minister of Agriculture and the United Nations World Food Programme warning that this could worsen the Ukrainian food crisis, and even exacerbate global hunger.
On 30 May, Russia claimed that it had started exporting last year's grain from Kherson to Russia, and were working on exporting sunflower seeds.
According to locals, Russian soldiers were picking strawberries in Kherson Oblast.Several African leaders said the western expansion of NATO contributed to the war, and blamed the west for food shortages and price increases.
He also blamed EU sanctions on Russian banks and products for worsening the situation.
Effects on Russian forces Several Russian soldiers, captured by Ukrainian forces, claimed that Russian officers killed their wounded.
There were also claims that Russian soldiers have killed their commanding officers, and sometimes themselves.
Some mothers of conscripted Russian soldiers have tried to get them out of Ukraine and returned to Russia.
A number of mothers have approached the Soldiers' Mothers Committee for advice.
Human rights lawyers and activists are claiming that Russian professional soldiers, also known as contract soldiers, are seeking legal advice so that they do not have to fight in Ukraine.
Some have sought legal advice to get out of the army however they have been told that they are in for the length of their contracts.
The pro-Russia militias raised in Donetsk and Luhansk have videos showing that they lack even basic protective armor and have old equipment.
It has also been reported that Russian soldiers and whole units have refused to obey their commanders' orders and have engaged in armed stand-offs with them.
Other impact Ukraine has a significant fertility tourism service industry which was severely impacted.
At the start of the invasion, surrogate mothers were displaced and distressed, requiring evacuation to safe areas.
Exact numbers are thought to be high, with many showing up on the coast near Odessa and in other countries.According to local officials, the first Russian passports have been handed out to citizens in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Region.

The protests were met with widespread repression by the Russian authorities.
According to OVD-Info, at least 14,906 people were detained from 24 February to 13 March 2022.
The Russian government cracked down on other forms of opposition to the war, including introducing widespread censorship measures and repression against people who signed anti-war petitions.
As well as the protests, there were also reported instances of anti-Russian sentiment and discrimination against the Russian diaspora and Russian-speaking immigrants as a result of the war.In some parts of Ukraine that were newly occupied by Russian armed forces, protests against the occupiers took place.
In March 2022, 98% of Ukrainians – including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine – said they did not believe that any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of Russia.
In China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia and the Arab regions, many social media users showed sympathy for Russian narratives due in part to distrust of United States foreign policy.
Many respondents in Russia do not want to answer pollsters' questions for fear of negative consequences.
He also warned that the war in Ukraine was becoming like the Spanish Civil War, in which new and more powerful weapons were tested.

Putin and Konstantin Ernst, chief of Russia's main state-controlled TV station Channel One.
Social media users shared real-time information about the invasion.Depictions of earlier events or other misinformation, sometimes deliberate, were also shared, in addition to authentic first-hand portrayals.
While many outlets tagged these misleading videos and images as false content, other sites did not.Putin introduced prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing ""fake news"" about Russian military operations, and fines or up to three years prison for calling for sanctions, prompting most Russian outlets to stop reporting on Ukraine.
Roskomnadzor also restricted access to Facebook, after it refused to stop fact-checking posts by state-owned Zvezda, RIA Novosti, Lenta.ru, and Gazeta.Ru.
Pro-Kremlin television pundits like Vladimir Solovyov and Russian state-controlled channels like Russia-24,Russia-1, and Channel One follow the government narrative.
The state-controlled TV where most Russians get their news presented the invasion as a liberation mission.Echo of Moscow closed down, and Roskomnadzor blocked access to BBC News Russian, Voice of America, RFE/RL, Deutsche Welle, and Meduza, as well as Facebook and Twitter.
A Moscow court demanded that Russian-language Wikipedia remove information about the invasion, and it fined the Wikimedia Foundation 5 million rubles for refusing to comply.Ukrainian propaganda focused on awareness of the war and Ukraine's need for weapons.

When the attack began, many other countries applied sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.
The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.
The sanctions cut major Russian banks from SWIFT, the global messaging network for international payments, but left some limited accessibility to ensure the continued ability to pay for gas shipments.
Sanctions also included asset freezes on the Russian Central Bank, which holds $630 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, to prevent it from offsetting the impact of sanctions and froze the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
By 1 March, total Russian assets frozen by sanctions amounted to $1 trillion.Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund , warned that the conflict posed a substantial economic risk both regionally and internationally.
The IMF could help other countries affected, she said, in addition to the $2.2 billion loan package for Ukraine.

In April 2022, Russia supplied 45% of EU's natural gas imports, earning $900 million a day.
Russia is the world's largest exporter of natural gas, grains, and fertilisers, and among the world's largest suppliers of crude oil, coal, steel and metals, including palladium, platinum, gold, cobalt, nickel, and aluminium.
In May 2022, the European Commission proposed a ban on oil imports from Russia.

In addition, Russia was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and waging war in violation of international law, indiscriminately attacking densely populated areas and exposing civilians to unnecessary and disproportionate harm.
Russian forces used cluster munitions, repudiated by most states because of their immediate and long-term danger to civilians. and fired other wide-area explosives like air-dropped bombs, missiles, heavy artillery shells and multiple launch rockets.
As of 25 March, the attacks had resulted in at least 1,035 civilian deaths and at least 1,650 civilian injuries.
Russian forces were accused of forcibly deporting thousands of civilians to Russia, sexual assaults, and deliberately killing Ukrainian civilians.

On 2 March, Karim Ahmad Khan, prosecutor for the ICC, opened a full investigation into past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed in Ukraine by any person from 21 November 2013 on.
The ICC also set up an online portal for people with evidence to contact investigators, and sent investigators, lawyers and other professionals to Ukraine to collect evidence.On 4 March 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council created the International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, an independent committee of three human rights experts with a mandate to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the invasion.

The International Association of Genocide Scholars supported Ukraine's request that the ICJ direct Russia to halt its offensive in Ukraine.
On 16 March, the ICJ ordered Russia to ""immediately suspend the military operations"" on a 13–2 vote, with the Russian and Chinese judges in opposition.
The order is binding, but the ICJ has no means of enforcement.Under international criminal law's principle of universal jurisdiction,investigations were opened in Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.
Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko also stated that Belarusian troops could take part in the invasion if needed, and Belarusian territory was used to launch missiles into Ukraine.
