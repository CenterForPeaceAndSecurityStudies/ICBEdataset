The Ukraine-Russia crisis Updated 1600 GMT February 24, 2022 A photo provided by the Ukrainian President's office appears to show an explosion in the capital city of Kyiv early Thursday, February 24.
Ukrainian President's Office After months of military buildup and brinkmanship, Russian forces have begun an attack on Ukraine.
Earlier this week, Putin ordered troops into separatist-held parts of eastern Ukraine in what the Kremlin called a ""peacekeeping"" mission, just hours after he signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Moscow-backed regions.
European countries and the United States have begun rolling out sanctions in response to Russia's actions.
A whirlwind of diplomatic efforts in recent weeks has so far failed to defuse tensions in the region.
Russia has been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep.
The escalation in the years-long conflict has triggered the greatest security crisis on the European continent since the Cold War, raising the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow.
