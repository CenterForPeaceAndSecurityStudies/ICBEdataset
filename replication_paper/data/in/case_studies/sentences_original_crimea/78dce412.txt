Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted.

Mark, a 27-year-old sales executive, said he was ready to be called up to fight.
Thursday's invasion followed weeks of escalating tensions, as Russia massed troops along Ukraine's borders.
The UK, EU and other Western allies have vowed to impose tough new sanctions to punish Moscow, but say they will not send in troops.
A man was also killed in shelling outside the major north-eastern city of Kharkiv.A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and many more were wounded.
Ukraine said it had killed 50 Russian troops and shot down six Russian aircraft, but this has not been verified.What Russia has targetedMr Zelensky said Russia had positioned almost 200,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles on Ukraine's borders ahead of Thursday's invasion.
Moscow first struck Ukraine's military infrastructure and border guard units.
Then Ukrainian forces said Russian military vehicles had crossed the border near Kharkiv in the north, Luhansk in the east, Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and from Belarus too.
Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said his country's military were not involved but could be if needed.Russian tanks were later seen on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1. million people.
Hours earlier Ukraine's president had asked how a people who lost eight million of its citizens fighting Nazis could support Nazism.

Mr Putin launched that attack after mass street protests in Ukraine that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.Since then more than 14,000 people have died in the east in a conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian forces.
A shaky ceasefire had held but there has been a surge in violations in recent days.Mr Putin said the military operation's objective was to defend the people in the breakaway areas.
Kyiv and its Western allies have repeatedly rejected as absurd Mr Putin's claims that Ukraine was being run by neo-Nazis, instead pointing out that Ukraine was now a nation with growing democratic institutions, unlike an authoritarian Russia.
Fears of a Russian attack have been rising for months.Mr Putin has repeatedly accused the United States and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining the Nato military alliance and offer Moscow security guarantees.
