From ""your guy Yats"" back in 2014 to now, Russia's oldest ally, Ukraine, is enroute to NATO membership.
Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said Thursday during an ""Independence Day"" celebration that the country had one path forward.
It is not the first time Poroshenko alluded to his government's desire to join the Western military alliance, something the Kremlin knew has been brewing since 2014.
For years, the Russian government has complained that the United States led NATO was encroaching on its old orbit.
Ukraine would be the final nail in the Russia vs NATO coffin, if you will, as it is the one country in the old Soviet Union that has the most ties to Russia.
Ten Warsaw Pact nations, not counting a re-unified Germany, have become NATO members since the fall of the Soviet Union, beginning with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in March of that year.
In theory, if Ukraine was a NATO member today, then the Russian backed separatists in East Ukraine would be fighting guys in NATO military surplus gear.
Since 2014, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, cooperation has intensified, helping play up the Vladimir Putin narrative that NATO expansion is targeting Russia and not Iran and terrorist groups from the Middle East as Russia's government is often told.
In July, NATO SecGen Stoltenberg addressed the Ukrainian parliament where he said that Ukraine is a sovereign state and could choose its own security arrangements.
Any decision on NATO membership is dependent on other members agreeing.
