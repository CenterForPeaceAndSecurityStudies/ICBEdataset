While Ukraine struggles to implement key conditions of the Minsk agreements, its foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, called on Russia to leave Donbas in DW interview.
In an attempt to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, both Kyiv and pro-Russian separatists from Donetsk and Luhansk signed the Minsk II settlement in February 2015.
Today, key aspects of the agreement, such as the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the exchange of prisoners, have yet to be implemented.
After Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, heavily armed separatists, backed by Moscow took over parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine.
Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed in the fighting to suppress the separatists.
Kyiv and Western countries have said Russian volunteers and regular troops actively support pro-Russian separatists.
While the sound of heavy artillery has subsided in eastern Ukraine, a solid ceasefire is not yet in sight.
Both the United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions against Moscow and have also called for reforms in Ukraine.
Another central element of Minsk II is a constitutional reform in Ukraine to grant formal autonomy to the separatist regions.
The first vote in August 2015 was overshadowed by violent protests, and the second has been postponed.
In September 2016, United States Vice President Joe Biden warned Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that unless Kyiv lives up to the promises of economic and political reforms, the EU may lift sanctions on Russia.
In the DW interview, Klimkin denied the charge and said his government was, indeed, battling corruption and ""delivering"" results.
