Putin Paying Steep Political Price for Crimea share Print Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says President Vladimir Putin's decision to annex Crimea, which occurred five years ago this week, has come at a significant financial cost to Russian citizens and a large political cost to the president himself.
Putin used the same speech to denounce the United States and its allies for having ""cheated"" Russia and made decisions behind its back.
Rising popular resentment Although Putin used his annual State of the Nation address in late February to vow increased social spending and popular handouts in a bid to salve popular resentment over falling living standards, Navalny said the gesture may be too little too late.
