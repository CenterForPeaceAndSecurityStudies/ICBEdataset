The Sea of Azov, a rich fishing ground in Soviet times that has been of great strategic importance to independent Ukraine, has emerged after months of growing friction as the latest flash point in the four-year conflict between Moscow and Kiev.
The move led to stern condemnation and sanctions from Kiev and Western governments.
And despite the current conflict between Kiev and Moscow, the agreement is still in place.
Odnoroh said that is not the case, arguing that Kiev has not paid enough attention to the escalating ""crisis"" in the sea.
Others in Mariupol also shake their heads at official remarks from Kiev.
As they do, several shipping companies are thinking twice about trips to Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov, according to Odnoroh and officials at the Port of Mariupol, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to provide official comments to media.
But it is unclear how persuasive Kiev has been when so much of the West is grappling with its own problems.
RFE/RL counted 14, including the Lyubomir, two patrol ships -the Donbass and the Onyx, which were smuggled out of Crimean ports during Russia's annexation -and 12 small patrol boats, four of which were getting fresh camouflage paint jobs to cover rusting hulls when RFE/RL visited.
Kiev has filed cases against Moscow with various international bodies in the past, with little success.
This month, Poroshenko said he had ordered the creation of a body to prepare a lawsuit against Russia for damages caused by separatists whom Moscow supports in the Donbass region and for its illegal annexation of Crimea.
Ukraine should have never let Russia have 80% of the Ukrainian navy vessels, when the ""little green men"" occupied Crimea.
