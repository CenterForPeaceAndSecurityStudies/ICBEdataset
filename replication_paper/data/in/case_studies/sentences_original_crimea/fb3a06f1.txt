As Putin celebrates the annexation of Crimea into Russia in 2014, he continues to advance further threats to the Ukraine through his sponsored military conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
In February 2014 Russian troops began their attack on the Ukraine, an attack which left most of Eastern Ukraine in the hands of �separatists� and Russian soldiers; ostensibly creating independent separatist states in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts; and later promoting a sham referendum on the return of Crimea to Russia.
Each day the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission reports of battles between the Ukrainian and Russian-sponsored troops in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Between 2014 and 2018, this military conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists continued in eastern Ukraine, where more than 10,000 people have been killed and thousands displaced.
It placed a freighter to block the port, saying that the Ukraine has violated Russian waters.
As the conflicts continue the underlying treaties and protocols which had been agreed to regulate the relations between Russia and the Ukraine have been violated by the Russians at almost every opportunity.
These formerly allied states of the USSR were granted or asserted their autonomy and became independent states.
In April 1991 Gorbachev had prepared a treaty recognising the breakup of the USSR into autonomous republics but was prevented from signing the treaty by the attempted coup against him in August of that year.
On August 24, 1991 the coup had failed and Kravchuk, the head of the Ukrainian parliament, passed a motion declaring the independence of the Ukraine with him as its first leader.
The U.S.�s primary concern was strategic; the control of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons.
At that time, the Ukraine was the third largest nuclear power in the world.
In a private letter to Clinton, Kravchuk promised that Ukraine would he nuclear free by June 1996.
Kiev finally settled their dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, when Prime Ministers Chernomyrdin and Lazarenko signed three intergovernmental agreements.
The two sides agreed to divide the fleet's assets and to lease port facilities in Sevastopol to the Russian Navy.
Under the agreement the two nations split the fleet's ships evenly, though Russia agreed to buy back some of the more modern ships with cash.
Thus, Russia ultimately received four-fifths of the Black Sea Fleet's warships, while Ukraine received about half of the facilities.
A crisis developed in August 2008 when several Russian Black Sea Fleet warships dropped anchor off the Georgian coast during and after the August 2008 Russian armed conflict with Georgia over Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
As a result, the then Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko announced that Ukraine would not extend the lease of the Sevastopol base beyond 2017,� and urged the Russian fleet to start preparations for a withdrawal.
The war in Georgia, which was supported by NATO and the European Union, and the threat by the Ukrainians that Russia would lose its warm-water naval bases in Crimea provoked the Russians to retaliate against both the Ukrainians and the European Union.
The Russians threatened to cut off supplies of natural gas to the Ukraine and Western Europe.
While the United States supported the Ukrainians in their defiance of the Russian threats the Europeans pressed for some sort of a compromise which would let the gas flow to their countries.
The Ukrainians were caught in the middle The Europeans were desperate for the Ukrainians to do whatever it took to assuage the Russian gas threat while the United States and its NATO allies pressed the Ukrainians to follow through on ending the Russian leases which allowed them a presence in the Black Sea.
Despite the arguments brought forward in favour of each of these policies a realistic assessment of the situation was made that there was no substitute at that time for Russian gas so a compromise would have to be reached with the Russians.
After much discussion a compromise was reached and the Ukrainian and Russian parliaments, on 27 April 2010, ratified a deal to extend the lease on the Russian naval bases in the Ukraine for 25 years after the then current lease expired in 2017.
The Europeans then began an accelerated process to bring the government of the Ukraine under its wing and control which could prevent further confrontations on the transport of gas.
Although the Ukraine was not very interested at that time in joining NATO, it was interested in establishing a relationship within the aegis of the European Union.
During her periods in office Tymoshenko met with the European Union under the terms of the European Neighbourhood Policy which aimed to create a ring of friendly states allied, but not members, of the European Union.
The �neocons� who dominated United States foreign policy towards the Ukraine were loath to lose the opportunity of denying the Russians the use of naval bases in the Black Sea; especially after the Georgian War.
While vaguely sympathetic to the Europeans, their main enemy was seen as Russia, and any diminution of Russian power and influence was their man concern.
Their key supporters within the Ukraine, Yuschenko and Tymoshenko had just lost control of the Ukraine in the national election of a new President, Victor Yanukovych who had taken office on the 25th of February 2010.
Victor Yanukovych was the President from the Donbas region which the Yuschenko and Timoshenko governments had largely ignored or opposed during their presidencies.
Former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko called on citizens to rise against the current leadership.
The European Union continued to encourage the Ukraine to move closer to EU accession.
However, the first thing the Europeans wanted was to control Ukrainian energy policy so that they could protect the European-wide price of gas.
In May 2010, President Victor Yanukovych promised to adopt the legislation necessary for creating a free trade zone between Ukraine and the European Union.
Further discussions in the next year led to proposals for even closer bonds between the EU and the Ukraine.
They were broken off when Yanukovych arrested and jailed Tymoshenko for corruption.
The EU put the accession of the Ukraine on hold until Yanukovych freed Tymoshenko, Although the EU then agreed to accept the accession of Ukraine into the EU, the Rada decided that before they would sign there should be a three-way trade agreement which included Russia to prevent a crisis with gas with the Russians.
Yanukovych refused to sign the agreement with the EU because his supporters, primarily in his Eastern heartland, were bitterly opposed to the terms of the accession to the EU as they came with a long list of economic austerity programs which were a part of the agreement.
Violence intensified and there were shootings and beatings on all sides.
On February 21 after negotiations between the president Yanukovych and representatives of the opposition and with mediation of representatives of the European Union and Russia the Agreement ""About settlement of political crisis in Ukraine"" was signed.
However, while this seemed generally acceptable as a compromise to the negotiators the protestors and the representatives of the United States government insisted on further concessions and the resignation of the President.
Later that day, the 21st of February 2014, the President felt that his time was up and that civil war was looming.
The Rada met the next day to impeach Yanukovych for being unable to perform his duties.
They set a date for new elections and, two days later, issued a warrant for the arrest of the ex-President for the �mass killings of civilians�iv With the ouster of Yanukovych, the Russians began supporting the rebelling regions of Donetsk and Luhansk who had supported the ousted Yanukovych.
They sent arms, equipment and �irregular� soldiers to fight against the Ukrainian army.
In April 2014, Russia supported local rebels who took over city halls and police stations throughout eastern entered without approval.
In July, Russia continued to strengthen its military force on the border.
There were 19,000 to 21,000 troops, 14 advanced surface-to-air missile units, and 30 artillery batteries.
Despite this, the battles continued and the Minsk Protocols were essentially irrelevant.
In summary, the Russians have sent troops and equipment to carry on a war against the Ukraine using their own troops and their surrogates in the Donetsk and Luhansk.
Stream 2) by the Europeans for Russian gas; a formidable decline in Russia�s ability to afford or achieve the modernisation of it military equipment and lack of competent manpower; and, most of all, a growing relationship with its newest partner, China.
One of the major difficulties of the Russian military stance towards the Ukraine has been the fact that the most developed facilities for military production were located in the Ukraine.
The Russian Army had been starved of new equipment for over twenty years and much of what they had available was built in the Ukraine.
The military-industrial complex of Ukraine is the most advanced and developed branch of the state's sector of economy.
It includes about 85 scientific organizations which are specialized in the development of armaments and military equipment for different usage.
The air and space complex consists of 18 design bureaus and 64 enterprises.
In order to design and build ships and armaments for the Ukrainian Navy, 15 research and development institutes, 40 design bureaus and 67 plants have been brought together.
This complex is tasked to design heavy cruisers, build missile cruisers and big antisubmarine warfare cruisers, and develop small ASW ships.
Rocketry and missilery equipment, rockets, missiles, projectiles, and other munitions are designed and made at 6 design bureaus and 28 plants.
Ukraine has its own scientific, technical and industrial capacities for the indigenous research, development and production of small arms.
A number of scientific-industrial corporations have started R&D and production of small arms.
The armour equipment is designed and manufactured at 3 design bureaus and 27 plants.
The scientific and industrial potential of Ukraine makes it possible to create and produce modern technical means of military communications and automated control systems at 2 scientific-research institutes and 13 plants.
A total of 2 scientificresearch institutes and 53 plants produce power supply batteries; 3 scientific-research institutes and 6 plants manufacture intelligence and radio-electronic warfare equipment; 4 design bureaus and 27 plants make engineer equipment and materiel.
Despite efforts by the Russian troops in the Eastern Ukraine many of the existing plants were attacked and damaged by the rebels of Donetsk and Lugansk.
Additionally, the skill set of the Russian factories has been degraded by the demographic crisis of Russia and the ageing population.
When the Ukrainian Government decreed that it was banning all military sales to Russia it was a challenge to Putin and his generals.
The Russian government� tallied up the costs of modernizing their aging military forces equipment and concluded that it will total about $800 billion.
Putin campaigned for the Presidency by calling for a rejuvenated Russian military.
Unfortunately, he didn�t have the money and the arms manufacturers were in no position to use the funds even if they got them, owing to their state of dereliction and the disappearance of skilled workers in the machine-tool industry.
Military modernisation was a key priority of the Russians but made infinitely more challenging by the loss of Ukrainian facilities, technology and skilled workers; and, of course, international sanctions.
Putin has consistently promised more funds for this endeavour but he has been hampered by several key problems, some of which he cannot control.
There were about 1,599,316 births in 2018, a decline of 5.4% relative to the 1,689,884 births in 2017.
There were about 1,817,710 deaths in 2018, a decline of 0.4% relative to the 1,824,340 deaths in 2017.
Consequently, the rate of natural increase declined from -134,456 in 2017, to -218,394 in 2018.
The population was estimated at 146,793,744 as of Jan 1, 2019, down from 146,880,432 exactly one year ago.
This implies about 131,706 in long-term net immigration, down from 172,551 last year.
If accurate, this would mark the first time since 2007 that the population of Russia has declined in absolute termsvii Most importantly there has been a mass migration of rural Russians in Siberia and the Russian East into the cities, leaving largely unpopulated regions and the influx of Asian migrants who have flooded into the East of Russia.
The cost of the continuing war in the Ukraine and the massive bleed of Russian military resources in Syria are taking a heavy toll on the Russian budget.
However, it has committed itself to a wide range of improvements in its military capabilities, despite its lack of adequate shipyards, missile factories, available conscript manpower, essential electronic and guidance systems and subsystems blocked by sanctions, the burden of maintaining aged and decrepit equipment and an ever-expanding effort to extend its political reach into the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
Much of this is the traditional Russian policy of bluff and bluster but, with the official burial of the INF Treaty, it is engaged in some expansion of its intermediate range of its missile systems.
These had already had a marked effect on the deployment of tanks by the Russians and the rebels.
In mid-December 2018 the Russians moved military convoys north on the Simferopol-Armyansk highway toward the border between Kherson Oblast� in Ukraine and Crimea.
Russia shifted fourteen Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets to Belbek Airbase near Sevastopol.
The Russians built a bridge over the Kerch Strait to bring supplies to the Crimea; an unsteady bridge which is not expected to last too long because of the seismic conditions in the Strait, but low enough to block many of the commercial vessels shipping goods to and from the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdiansk.
The United States and the Europeans have been pushing back against this attempt by Russia to strangle the Ukraine economically by sending vessels and missile cruisers to the area but the Russians haven�t stopped their continued pressure on the Ukraine.
However there is a new dimension to the power equation in the Ukraine with the arrival of a large Chinese presence.
China has increased its involvement in Ukraine, using development assistance through its Belt and Road Initiative as a rational for its efforts.
China aggressively competes with Ukraine�s Western partners for a strong foothold in this important frontier economy.
While investment and aid from Europe and North America has a price-tag, China and Chinese companies have a huge pot of money that they're largely willing to spend without explicit conditions.
A free trade agreement and visa-free regime has contributed to the European Union becoming Ukraine's largest bilateral trading partner 30 billion euros per year, with 27 percent year-on-year increases.
Canada also has an FTA with Ukraine while trade with the United States is steady.
China sees the Ukraine as a special area of interest, both for its location and for its agricultural productivity.
Ukraine has access to the Danube River, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
It has 170,000 kilometres of road and 22,000 kilometres of interconnected railway to Europe.
At the moment there is no open conflict between China and Russia over the Ukraine, although its is clear that the Chinese are opposing any expanded military initiatives between Russia and the Ukraine; especially those which close down its ports and rail lines.
China has essentially economic interests in the Ukraine, interests which will disappear if hostilities break out between the two.
The Chinese have grown to be a much more formidable military power than the Russians.
Their military history is one which demonstrates the growth in Chinese power.
The most important conflict between the Russian military and Putin arose from Putin�s policy towards China.
Putin has been making every effort to engage with the Chinese in asking their assistance to join with Russia as a consumer of its energy exports and as a builder of pipelines, ports, railroads and as a financial partner.
This has put Putin in direct conflict with the Russian military who see the Chinese as a strategic enemy.
There has been an intense competition between the two nations in their border regions for decades; a competition which led to military confrontation between the two along the Ussuri River.
In May 1962 60,000 ethnic Uighurs , crossed from China�s Xinjiang Province into the Soviet Union where they received assistance and materiel for their separatist aims.
In an effort to restore harmony the Chinese and the Soviets started talks to regularise the conflict.
In these talks it became apparent that there were long-standing Chinese grievances over the stripping and annexing of Chinese land by the Russian and Soviet states since the late 1890s from the weak Qing Dynasty.
This included the land in the Pamir Mountains and the territory of Tajikistan.
In addition, the Treaty of Beijing in 1900 had stripped away Outer Mongolia from China and drawn the riverine boundaries of the Argun, the Amur and the Ussuri Rivers so that the Chinese only controlled their own banks of these rivers.
The Soviets controlled the water but the whole river and the islands in them.
On the Eastern Front, in March 1969, the Chinese PLA suddenly attacked the Soviet border guards on Zenbao Island, killing 59 soldiers.
Chinese Marshal Lin Biao, Commander of the Shenyang Military District, generated the plan of attack in January 1969 under the code name �Retribution � which was signed off by Mao Tze Tung.
About three hundred PLA soldiers crossed over to the island on the night of March 2 and suddenly opened fire on the group of Russian border guards that had been sent to investigate at mid-morning, killing almost all of them.
Out on the ice of the Ussuri River, the Russian unit evidently had no protection and was quickly destroyed.
After about two weeks the Soviet troops forced the Chinese off the island.
In August 1969 there were further incidents; this time in the West, in Xinjiang.
There, after a few scuffles, the Soviets crossed the border and killed around 30 Chinese soldiers in Tieleketi.
Not only were the Chinese concerned about the Soviets backing Uighur dissidents, they were worried about a Soviet attack on nearby Lop Nur, the site of China�s nuclear test facilities.
There continued to be further incidents during the Cultural Revolution.
Negotiations were resumed in 1991 and a partial treaty signed on May 29, 1994.
This was completed in November 1997 at a summit meeting in Beijing where Yeltsin and Jiang Zemin agreed a treaty establishing the border between the two countries.
Relations have been strained since then as there is an increasing imbalance between the two sides; militarily, economically and in terms of manpower.
Even the Russians admit that this work will be performed by Chinese labourers.
The politicians may think it makes sense to shift their focus to co-operation with China but the Russian military has no such compulsions.
The Russian military said that they were concerned for the naval bases in Sovetskaya Gavan and Bolshoi Kamen not far away.
They were surprised that Putin worried more about NATO than they worry about the Chinese with billions of people a quarter of a mile away across the Amur and the Ussuri Rivers.
They fear that Russia would not be strong enough to protect itself if the Chinese decided to take back some of its lost lands in the Russian Far East.
China is trying to buy or control the vast military capability of the Ukraine which was denied to the Russians after their invasion of the Ukraine.
Ukrainians and its Western partners are not willing to allow what many consider a national treasure become Chinese owned.
China has been buying components from Motor Sich since the 1990s and wants to get access to their trade secrets and key personnel.
Russia is nervous as well because until 2014 Russia was also dependent on Motor Sich for some key aircraft and industrial components.
As long as Russia is occupying Crimea and parts of Donbas those business relationships are blocked and Russia has not been successful in creating adequate Russian suppliers.
We need high-precision missiles and we are not going to repeat the mistakes of the Budapest memorandum. iv ""A warrant out for Viktor Yanukovych's arrest, says Interior Minister"", Guardian.
