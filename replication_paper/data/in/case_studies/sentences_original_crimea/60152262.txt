Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said President Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. âThe president of the Russian Federation decides it all,â he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelenskiy said. âI cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.â A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his countryâs invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment.
If we are talking about ending this war without him personally, that decision cannot be taken.
I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.
Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused ârussophobiaâ since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia was working to replace goods imported from western countries, he said, and in future, would rely only on âreliableâ countries not beholden to the west.
Lavrov set down grievances with western countries that he said were determined to change the rules of international relations to Russiaâs detriment.
He warned, however, that an embargo would not automatically weaken the Kremlin.
Rising global oil prices after the United States announced an embargo on Russian oil enabled it to rake in more income while selling lower volumes.
President Joe Biden decided to withdraw American troops from Ukraine before Russiaâs 24 February invasion in order to avoid a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary.
But changing circumstances including a reopening of the United States embassy have raised questions about whether United States troops may be required to return to help ensure security of diplomats in a country at war.
At a news conference, Milley acknowledged some degree of staff planning ahead of a potential decision to send United States troops back into Ukraine.
That planning hasnât made it to his level for review or to the level of United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin where ultimately, it would be up to Biden.
The territorial dispute over the isles â which Russia says are part of its Kuril chain and which Japan calls its northern territories â has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from reaching a peace treaty formally ending second world war hostilities.
Rogozin proposed to change the name of one of the islands to Varyag in honour of a cruiser whose sinking started the Russo-Japanese war in 1904.
Bondarev said he had handed in his resignation before sending a scathing letter to foreign colleagues inveighing against the âaggressive war unleashedâ by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine.
Michael McFaul, the former United States ambassador to Russia, commended Boris Bondarevâs decision to resign and encouraged other Russian officials to do the same.
The war in Ukraine has impacted the global economy and could lead to recessions in vulnerable countries, according to the head of International Monetary Fund.\nAfter months of providing shelter to residents, the subway system in Kharkiv will begin operating again this week.
McDonalds has removed the âgolden archesâ from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good.
The images, which were produced by Maxar Technologies, are from 19 and 21 May.
In them, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by.
Itâs difficult to know for certain whether the ship is being loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain, but Russia-annexed Crimea produces little grain itself, unlike the agriculturally rich Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia immediately to the north.
Ukrainian officials and industry sources have told CNN that Russian forces in occupied areas have emptied several silos and trucked the grain south.
After more than three decades, the company is selling the restaurants to a local licensee and they will operate under a different name.
McDonaldâs had in March decided to close its restaurants in the country, including the Pushkin Square location in central Moscow that had been a symbol of flourishing American capitalism in the dying embers of the Soviet Union.
The departure of McDonaldâs is one of the most high-profile so far in opposition to what Russia calls its special operation in neighboring Ukraine.â McDonaldâs opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, a move largely seen as a signal just one year before the Soviet Union collapsed.

I havenât yet been back in Ukraine since the war started but of course I intend to go there, and I intend to make a film, about those atrocities that are taking place at the moment.
Culture in general, by definition, opposes war â it is something that is absolutely against any war.

The accusations center on a 2010 pact signed by Yanukovych that extended Russiaâs lease on naval facilities in Crimea.
That agreement, widely known in Ukraine as the Kharkiv pact, allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, Reuters reports.
Yanukovych has already received a 13-year jail sentence in absentia for treason, in connection to a letter he sent to Vladimir Putin in 2014.
The letter asked the Russian leader to use his countryâs army and police forces to restore order in Ukraine.

A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine.
Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.
Ukraineâs prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday.
Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Monday.
The new security packages included âdonating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehiclesâ, he said.
Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraineâs Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. âLow-levelâ discussions are reportedly underway on whether some United States troops should be based in Ukraine and how the United States may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added.
Ukraineâs president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether âbrute forceâ should rule the world.
In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia.
The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports âwithin daysâ and may require capping global oil prices, Germanyâs economy minister said on Monday. âWe will reach a breakthrough within days,â Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF, adding that the European Commission and the United States were working on a proposal to no longer pay âany priceâ for oil, but to cap global prices.
While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.
Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy.
Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday.
Zelenskiyâs figure would give the Desna attack Ukraineâs biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far.
The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media.
The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned.
Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly.
New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain, according to a series of images released by Maxar Technologies, seemingly backing up claims from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported.
In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by.
Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business in the country for the Seattle-based coffee company.
McDonalds has also removed the âgolden archesâ from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good.
There are no other grounds for any other kind of meeting.âZelenskiy added that arranging any talks with Russia was becoming more difficult in light of what he said was evidence of Russian actions against civilians under occupation.
In addition to direct revenue for the state budget, this is a chance to develop far east and eastern Siberia.âChina, he said, had information and communications technologies âthat are in no way inferior to the west.

Weâre still developing courses of action, and none of thatâs been presented yet to the Secretary.âMilley did not specify whether he was referring to low-level planning for United States troops to potentially secure a United States diplomatic presence in Ukraine or potentially for other activities as well.
Bondarev, 41, confirmed his resignation in a letter posted on his Facebook page.âFor 20 years of my diplomatic career, I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on 24 February of this year,â he wrote, alluding to the date of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.Russian diplomat to UN in Geneva quits over Ukraine war â videoUpdated at 18.35Â EDT23 May 202218.07Today so farIt is just after 1am in Kyiv.

Satellite images reportedly show Russian-flagged ships stealing grain from Ukraine, as officials warn of a food crisis that could be felt around the world.

It was initially bound for Egypt with its cargo, but it was turned away from Alexandria after a warning from Ukrainian officials, according to the countryâs government.
It was also barred entry to Beirut, eventually docking in Latakia, in Syria, where Russia has for years been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
Meanwhile, Russia has stopped Ukrainian exports from the ports, creating the potential for a global food crisis.
With Ukraine a top exporter of wheat and other food products, supply is already becoming strained. âThe world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it,â Zelenskiy said over the weekend.

The departure comes at a high cost, and the company will write off a $1.4bn charge while also covering pay for the 62,000 employees now out of work, until the newly branded restaurants reopen. âSome might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens is surely the right thing to do,â Kempczinski said. âBut it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.
