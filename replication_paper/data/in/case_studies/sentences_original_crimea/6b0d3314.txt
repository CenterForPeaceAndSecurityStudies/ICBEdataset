Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has asked Nato members, including Germany, to send naval vessels to the Sea of Azov to back his country in its stand-off with Russia.
President Vladimir Putin has insisted Russian forces were right to seize three Ukrainian ships and their crews last weekend as they sailed from Odessa to Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov.
But Mr Poroshenko declared Mr Putin ""wants nothing less than to occupy the sea.
Yesterday, Nato said it already has a strong presence in the Black Sea region.
Mr Poroshenko also told the German newspaper that German ""Chancellor Merkel is a great friend of Ukraine.
Yesterday Mr Poroshenko also said his government will impose unspecified restrictions on Russian citizens in response to the seizure of the vessels and their crews.
He said the one-month period of martial law introduced this week in Ukraine wouldn't restrict travel, cash withdrawals or currency purchases by Ukrainians but Russians will face some constraints.
Meanwhile, Ms Merkel said she will not cancel plans for a joint pipeline with Russia, but pledged to ensure Ukraine remains a transit country for Russian natural gas.
Ms Merkel said the latest crisis was ""entirely the doing of the Russian president"" and accused Moscow of violating a 2003 agreement guaranteeing free movement in the area.
There is no military solution to these problems we have to emphasise that,"" Ms Merkel said.
