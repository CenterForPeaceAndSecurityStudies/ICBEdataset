MOSCOW — Ukrainian and Western officials are worried that a Russian military buildup near Ukraine could signal plans by Moscow to invade its ex-Soviet neighbor.The Kremlin insists it has no such intention and has accused Ukraine and its Western backers of making the claims to cover up their own allegedly aggressive designs.It’s unclear whether the Russian troop concentration heralds an imminent attack.
Ukraine, which was part of the Russian empire for centuries before becoming a Soviet republic, won independence as the USSR broke up in 1991.
The country has moved to shed its Russian imperial legacy and forge increasingly close ties with the West.
ADVERTISEMENTA decision by Kremlin-leaning Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to reject an association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Moscow sparked mass protests that led to his ouster in 2014.
Russia responded by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and throwing its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine’s east.Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels.
ADVERTISEMENTAdditionally, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces says Russia has about 2,100 military personnel in Ukraine’s rebel-controlled east and that Russian officers hold all commanding positions in the separatist forces.
The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of failing to honor the 2015 peace deal and criticized the West for failing to encourage Ukrainian compliance.
The agreement was a diplomatic coup for Moscow, requiring Ukraine to grant broad autonomy to the rebel regions and offer a sweeping amnesty to the rebels.Ukraine, in turn, has pointed to cease-fire violations by Russia-backed separatists and insists there is a continuing Russian troop presence in the rebel east despite the Kremlin’s denials.
The Russian president has repeatedly described Russians and Ukrainians as “one people” and claims that Ukraine has unfairly received historic Russian lands during Soviet times.Putin has strongly emphasized that Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO represent a red line for Moscow, and also expressed concern about plans by some NATO members to set up military training centers in Ukraine.
Putin’s foreign affairs advisor, Yuri Ushakov, said the Russian leader will push for these guarantees in a video call with United States President Joe Biden set for Tuesday, but numerous former United States and NATO diplomats say any such Russian demand to Biden would be a nonstarter.
Russia rejected talk of an invasion plot as a Western smear campaign and charged the claims could conceal a Ukrainian intention for an attack in the east.
Ukraine denies such plans.Some observers interpret the troop buildup as a demonstration by Putin that Russia is prepared to raise the stakes to convince NATO to respect Moscow’s red lines and stop sending troops and weapons to Ukraine.Last month, Putin noted with satisfaction that Moscow’s warnings finally have some traction and caused a “certain stress” in the West.
United States officials conceded that Moscow’s intentions are unclear, but pointed to Russia’s past behavior as a cause for concern.Biden pledged Friday to make it “very, very difficult” for Putin to attack Ukraine, saying that a set of new initiatives coming from his administration are intended to deter Russian aggression.

Ukraine and eastern Europe – there is this effect of rising tensions, or at least it is perceived.
Former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement, but Biden has made rehabilitating the accord a top priority as Iran enriches uranium closer to the purity level required for a weapon.
The test, which the United States condemned as “recklessly conducted,” sparked new fears about the militarization of space, and the prospects that such tests could pose hazards to space exploration and development for generations to come.
The Biden-Putin discussion will also come weeks after China was revealed to have tested a hypersonic sub-orbital weapon.

The United States shuttered two Russian compounds in 2016 in retaliation for Russian election meddling and also expelled some Russian diplomats on spying charges.
Russia retaliated by shuttering United States outposts and curtailing America’s’ ability to hire local workers in Moscow to staff its embassy.
The row escalated in recent months over visas for United States diplomats in Russia, resulting in critical staffing issues.
In their first in-person meeting in June, Biden pressed Putin to crack down on malicious cyber actors and earlier this year sanctioned some companies and individuals associated with the effort.
