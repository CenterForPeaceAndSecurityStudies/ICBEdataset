This is supposed to be a ‘defensive’ measure against «Russian aggression», as Obama puts it.
Taking over the country by means of a coup, instead of by means of sending in the United States military, is just as much an invasion.
Obama’s takeover of Ukraine was undeniably an invasion, and an equally successful one as any military takeover of any country; it was also very bloody, as almost all invasions are.
American ‘news’ media can ignore the coup now, like they long ignored the coup in Iran, but ignoring it doesn’t mean that the coup didn’t occur.
Furthermore, prior to America’s takeover of Iran, the government there had been a new and young democracy, and it had come to power democratically; so, America replaced a democracy there with a dictatorship.
Of course, we had done it also in Chile and many other places; these are just two of America’s many coups – the American elite are obsessed with conquest, and this is their preferred way of doing it.
And, just as in Iran, they replaced a democracy with a dictatorship, and it’s not reported in their press.
It killed untold numbers of people and expelled over a million, with their former residences and workplaces largely or wholly destroyed.
So, this was at least as much an invasion as was Eisenhower’s invasion of Iran in 1953 – perhaps more so.
Obama’s coup in Ukraine occurred in February 2014, and the breakaway of Crimea from Ukraine and its returning to Russia occurred less than a month after that.
Therefore, if, in fact, Putin invaded Ukraine in 2014, then it was in response to Obama’s coup in Ukraine, and to what Obama and his team needed to do in order to keep their people in power.
