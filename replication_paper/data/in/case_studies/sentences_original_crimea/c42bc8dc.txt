They transported him from there to Crimea and further to Russia,&quot; former Russian journalist of the Center for Investigation Management Sergey Kanev, who took part in a probe by The Insider and Bellingcat into the suspects in the Skripals case told Ukraine&#039;s Hromadske news outlet.
According to Kanev, it was for that special operation that Chepiga was decorated the title of &quot;Hero of Russia.&quot; The investigator said that Alexey Dyumin, a former security guard of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also received the &quot;Hero of Russia&quot; award for the &quot;evacuation&quot; of Yanukovych from Ukraine. &quot;Then that man worked for the Ministry of Defense, and now he is governor of Tula region.
I also know that the people who later formed the backbone of Private Military Company Wagner also got awards for Yanukovych&#039;s evacuation,&quot; Kanev said.
Yanukovych&#039;s lawyer, Alexander Goroshinsky, who recently joined the case, told Hromadske that he knew nothing about Russian special operations forces&#039; involvement in the &quot;evacuation&quot; of Yanukovych.
He also said he did know anyone with such names as Chepiga and Boshirov. &quot;I have not studied this issue.
I haven&#039;t read all the materials, but in those which I have, I haven&#039;t read anything &quot; the lawyer said.
The prosecutor in the Yanukovych treason case, Ruslan Kravchenko, said that he could neither confirm nor deny the participation of Chepiga-Boshirov in the &quot;evacuation&quot; of the ex-president, because the investigators were not aware who of the Russians had participated in that operation.
Then that man worked for the Ministry of Defense, and now he is governor of Tula region.
