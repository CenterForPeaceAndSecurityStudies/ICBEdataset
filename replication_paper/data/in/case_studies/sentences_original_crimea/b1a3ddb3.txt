UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has sent a stern warning to Moscow as renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine intensifies.
Her message comes amid a flurry of criticism over the Trump Administration's policy toward Russia.
Haley used her first appearance at the UN Security Council on Thursday to speak out against Moscow's alleged role in ongoing fighting in Ukraine, as critics of President Donald Trump accused the new administration of sidling up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Haley said that it was ""unfortunate"" that she had to use her first public appearance at the Council to criticize Russia over its ""aggressive actions"" but warned that escalating violence was endangering thousands of civilians.
Critics in the United States have lashed out over the Trump Administration's perceived closeness to Moscow.
Newly appointed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil, has close associations with Putin and has openly opposed sanctions levelled against Moscow.
Haley's comments come in response to renewed fighting between government forces and Moscow-backed rebel groups in eastern Ukraine, which has provoked concerns of a growing humanitarian crisis in the Donbass region of Ukraine.
More than 10,000 people have been killed in the fighting, which began in the wake of the 2014 revolution that led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, a close ally of Russia.
At least 13 people have been killed in the latest bout of violence, while tens of thousands have been left without heat or water in freezing conditions.
Ukraine's foreign ministry accused Russia of violating the ceasefire agreement signed last year, while Moscow said Ukraine had launched an attack on rebels on Monday.
Iran confirmed on Wednesday that it had fired the missile but denied it violated the stipulations of the nuclear deal reached between Tehran and several international powers reached in 2015.
