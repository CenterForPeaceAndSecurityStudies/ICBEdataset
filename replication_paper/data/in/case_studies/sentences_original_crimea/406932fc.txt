Decision could undermine Washington’s rationale for slapping tariffs on close allies.
The World Trade Organization has upheld Russia’s claim that national security justified severe restrictions it placed on Ukrainian freight transit after the conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out in 2014.
The 5 April decision agreed with Russia’s argument that it imposed the measures against the transit of Ukrainian goods to protect its national security after then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country and Kyiv lost control over parts of the Donbas region, the Kyiv Post reports.
Russian President Vladimir Putin decreed that no road or rail transport from Ukraine could be handled unless the route also went through Belarus.
The Russian Economy Ministry said the ruling had recognized Ukraine’s arguments to be unfounded.
More importantly, Russia said the issue was of systemic importance for the WTO, Reuters writes, noting that the organization has never before issued a judgement on the right to a national security exemption from global trade rules.
Its producers have been unable to ship goods through Russian territory to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan since 2016.
In the first year of the ban, Ukrainian exports to the two countries fell by nearly half, or about $400 million, according to the Kyiv Post.
Russia also imposed transit restrictions on Ukrainian freight bound for Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
The Kyiv paper notes that Russia’s argument was upheld even though it was Moscow that orchestrated the takeover of Crimea and backed the Donbas separatists, thus arguably worsening security in the region.
The ruling could have major implications for global trade and the WTO itself.
This language could undermine the national security argument the Trump administration has used to justify metal tariffs against the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and other countries, Bloomberg says.
