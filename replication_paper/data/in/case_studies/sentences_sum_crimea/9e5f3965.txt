 Study seeks to explain Russian behaviour in Crimea, Crimea and Donbas .
 There is so far not an abundance of reliable sources. Because of the recent nature of events, there is not a lot of reliable source .
 Some of the ﬁndings in this study should be seen as suggestive rather than conclusive .
 It is argued that dominating Russian axioms about Russians and Ukrainian being one people is necessary preconditions for the Russian behaviour . The West is using popular uprisings as a means of war against unwanted regimes .
 The explanation is not complete without considerations on the dominant position of people with background from the Federalnaia Sluzhba Bezopasnosti in the inner decision-making circle, and on Putin’s risk-taking, improvisation and emotions .
 Study aims to explain why Russia decided to use military force against Ukraine in 2014 . The study aims to understand why Russia used military force in 2014.
 The study is premature in the sense that more reliable information on motives and processes of decision-making may be available at a later stage when archives may be open .
 The chances are great that by then the study will have only historical and academic interest . However, the chances are also great that it will only have historical and Academic interest .
 Academically, the study falls within the ﬁeld of foreign policy decision-making .
 It is a theoretically informed case study, where the purpose is to explain actual decisions, not to make general statements about foreign policy decision-making. It is, furthermore, a theoreticallyinformed case study .
 The two decisions to use force are the dependent variables . The decision is based on force, which is dependent on force .
 The aim is to reconstruct what may have been the processes and thinking taking place in the Russian leadership that led to the use of military force . The aim, to the extent currently possible, is to rebuild what may be the processes.
 Dominating axioms are here understood as discourse rather than belief system . Dominating Axioms is not a matter of discourse, but it is a way of talking .
 It means that not all members of the Russian political elite have to genuinely believe in the dominating 'truth' about Russia, Ukraine and the West . But certain axioms exist that it is personally risky to challenge .
 The identiﬁcation of the most important of these axioms is a task for this study . The Identi ﬁcation of theseAxioms was the study's main aim .
 The procedure of foreign policy-making concerns is among other things questions of bureaucratic politics and group-think .
 Bureaucratic politics refers to the idea that political outcomes are the results of bargains among institutions at the sub-state level . The idea is that political outcome is the result of a political outcome in a state .
 These institutions may have both their own and the national interest at hart .
 Group-think refers to mechanisms that tend to reduce alternative views and information among decisionmakers . Group- think refers to mechanism that tends to reduce alternatives to alternative views .
 Putin’s personality concerns all aspects relating to the Russian president himself that may contribute to the explanation for the use of force .
 A discussion is also included on to what extent Putin has a wish to continue to stay in power . The discussion also includes whether this may be part of the explanation for use of force against Ukraine .
 There are in particular three dominating axioms that may contribute to Russia's use of force in Ukraine .
 The West is using popular uprisings against regimes it dislikes to wage war on them . Second, that the West, with a mixture of economic, political and military means, is using the West's political and political means .
 Russia has been wronged by the West for the last 20 years, and that after Euromaidan the time had ﬁnally come to put the foot down. Third, that Russia had been wronging the West .
 The Russian acceptance of Ukrainian independence was in the post-Soviet period always qualiﬁed . The Russian accept of Ukraine independence was always qualI�áed .
 Russia did not necessarily have an argument with the independent status of Ukraine as such as such . Russia didn't necessarily have a argument with Ukraine's independent status .
 The Russians for a long time thought that there was little to worry about when the Ukrainians talked about a future in Europe .
 After the Orange revolution in 2004-2005, that illusion was broken . The Orange revolution was in place for the first time in 2005 .
 The new Russian narrative became that Ukraine still wanted to be ‘with Russia’ But that an evil alliance of Western imperialists and minority Ukrainian nationalists were trying to prevent this .
 Opinion polls in Ukraine had long shown that a majority of Ukrainians combined positive attitudes towards Russia with a pro-European prospect . But this fact may have been little recognized in Russia .
 The concern over developments in Ukraine increased substantially after Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 .
 The return of Victor Yanukovych as president was no guarantee for Ukraine remaining with Russia rather than with the West . By then, it was clear that even the return of Yanukovych was no guarantees for Ukraine .
 Putin had put serious efforts into helping Yanukovych win the presidential election in 2004 . Putin had been trying to help Yanukovych win in 2004.
 The Orange revolution instead led Victor Yushchenko to the presidency . This was explained solely as a result of Western interference .
 Yanukovych's return to the presidency after relatively free and fair elections in 2010 was seen in the Kremlin as a restoration of the natural order of things . Yanukovych’s return to presidency was seen as a restore of thenatural order.
 Yanukovych, after some initial pro-Russian steps, also began to pursue more pro-Western and especially pro-European course .
 Many in the Kremlin probably concluded that the power of Western meddling had not been negated by Yanukovych’s presidency .
 Russia's desire to keep Ukraine close is a question of both ideology and interests . Why there is such a strong desire in Russia to keep Russia close is an issue of ideology and interest .
 The difference between ideologically and interest-based motivation may sometimes be hard to identify .
 This study uses the two concepts suggested by Jennifer Hochschild . It uses the understanding of the two ideas suggested by the author .
 Ideology is in her account about the realms of morality, identity and causation/interpretation .
This means that it concerns questions about what the actor considers right or wrong . This means that the actor sees himself to be and how he is related to others . The actor interprets phenomena and processes in the way he interprets them .
 Hochschilds deﬁnition is a purely ideological notion . Interest is about material or physical desires .
Third parties and Ukrainian dissenters can only succeed if they are able to force or trick the Ukrainians into anti-Russian positions . Such endeavours can only be the result of the efforts of third parties and Ukraine dissenters, says the author .
There was no reference to any grievances against the Yanukovych regime that the Ukrainian people may have had . There was no mention of any grievances.
 Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma in 2003 published a book simply called Ukraine is not Russia .
Kuchma was a representative of the Eastern Ukrainian business elite . Kuchma, similar to Yanukovych, was similar to the Ukrainian president .
 The title was produced by somebody from that part of the Ukrainian elite, long seen as a potential Kremlin ally . It would be especially disappointing to Moscow that such a title would be produced by someone from that group .
 The axiom about Russians and Ukrainians being one and the same is seldom contradicted in the Russian elite .
 It has adherents, not only in the pro270 T BUKKVOLL regime camp, but also among the opposition . It is also in the T BukKVOll regime camp .
 In the wider population, fewer and fewer seem to think this is the case . Fewer and fewer appear to think that this is a case .
 The independent polling and sociological research institute Levada centre has asked Russian public opinion about this topic since 2004 .
 81% of respondents thought Russians and Ukrainians were the same people in 2005 . In 2005, 81% thought Russians, Ukrainians were same people .
 A signiﬁcant number of Russians are likely to say in opinion polls what they think the authorities would like them to say rather than what they actually think . This means that a signi ﬁCant number. of Russians is likely to be more likely to
In the current case, some respondents may have answered that they thought Russians and Ukrainians are the same people because they know the political leadership thinks this .
 The September 2015 survey suggests that the rift between elite discourse and public opinion may be even bigger . The survey was conducted in September 2015 .
 This point may be relevant also for the other survey results quoted in this study . The survey results may also be relevant to the other results quoted .
 We do not have empirical data on how widespread the belief that Russians and Ukrainians are the same people is within the elite . We don't have evidence to prove that the belief is widespread .
 It may be that the axiom, while seldom contradicted, also has only partial elite support . It may also have only partial support .
 This, nevertheless, does not necessarily diminish its explanatory power . This, however, doesn't necessarily diminish the explanatory power. This, despite this, is not necessarily diminished .
 If the axioms are understood as discourse, then the degree of genuine individual belief is of limited relevance for the explanatory power of the axiom .
 The dominating discourse, that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, is established by those who have the power to do so . To contradict this statement may leave an individual outside the group or even open up for sanctions against that individual .
 This is not to dismiss that expressed believes may be genuine, just that it is very hard to know . It's not to dismissed that expressed belief may be true .
 The second axiom is that the West is using popular uprisings to gain geopolitical advantage at the cost of Russia . The West is both an ideologically and interest-based notion .
 Ideologically, it is about why a popular uprising took place in Ukraine and about the ‘slyness’ of the methods used to bring it about .
 In terms of interests, it is about Russia losing advantage to the West in terms of economics and security . Russia is losing advantage in term of economics, security, and economics .
 The causation/interpretation element was vividly demonstrated to the author of this study . He was present at a conference on international security hosted by the Russian ministry of defence in 2014 .
 The ﬁrst conference panel included presentations by Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu, Chief of the General Staff Valerii Gerasimov and others .
 The main message from all of them was that ‘colour revolutions’ is the new Western way of waging war on Russia . ‘ colour revolutions” is the latest Western way to waging war against Russia, they said .
 Some Russians will say that international politics has always been a ﬁerce battle without rules .
 Russian politicians have probably reached the conclusion that if the West is waging war in this way, then Russia can do the same . Second, many Russian politicians say that if Russia is fighting the West, then it can do same .
 Russia will of course still claim that both the incorporation of Crimea into Russia and the rebellion in the Donbas were the results of genuine popular uprisings against Kiev .
Privately, nonetheless, they of course know their own role in those events . Privately, though, they know their role in these events .
 This should probably be seen more as part of the international battle for the narrative than as genuine moral indignation . The world is outraged by what they see as Western instrumental use of popular uprisings .
 The ‘Western use of popular uprisings’ axiom has a slightly broader support in the population .
 In a November 2015 Levada poll, respondents were asked why they thought Ukrainian leadership is striving for closer relations with Europe and more independence from Russia .
Despite what Putin and other Russian leaders say, there are almost as many Russians who think Ukraine's pro-European policy is a result of indigenous views as those who think the Ukrainians have just been manipulated by the West .
 The interest-based part of the second axiom is that Russia will lose economically and geo-strategically by Ukraine going west . The secondAxiom: Russia will losing economically and economically by Ukraine.
 A leaked Kremlin policy paper from February 2014 suggests that the Russian motivation for holding on to Ukraine is not necessarily limited to ideology .
 Russia could lose Ukraine as a customer for oil and gas and completely lose control over the Ukrainian pipeline system . This policy paper warns in particular that Russia may lose Ukraine.
 Russia would get access to substantial and well-qualiﬁed labour resources . If Russia one way or another gets control over a number of Ukraine’s eastern provinces, Russia would have access to significant labour resources.
 It would control signiﬁcant parts of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex . Furthermore, it would control part of the Ukraine military complex .
 The authenticity of this document has not been recognized by anyone close to the Kremlin . If genuine, it may indicate that interest-based motives may have been part of the internal deliberations .
 The costs for Russia of the Donbas war have already far exceeded any economic gain . The cost of the war is now likely to be higher than any economic gains .
 The decision to intervene was taken at the time of the incident . However, that does not mean things did not look more optimistic .
 Many in the Kremlin expected to get control over more proﬁtable parts of Ukrainian industry than the largely derelict coalmines they currently control .
 Also, they may have expected much weaker Ukrainian military responses and feebler and shorter lasting economic sanctions . Also, it may have been expected a much weaker Ukraine military responses .
 This mainly relates to the fear of Ukrainian NATO membership if the country manages to distance itself from Russia . The fear of Ukraine's membership is mainly due to the country's lack of NATO membership .
 The third axiom, to repeat, is that Russia has been wronged by the West for the last 20 years . After Euromaidan the time had come for the country to put the foot down.
 The West instead of being grateful reacted by creating new walls around Russia . Yet, the West has not reacted to the West's reaction .
 Russian leadership statement was a polite version of how others in the Russian leadership interpret the post-cold war developments .
 Glazev is a Kremlin radical, and many in the Kremlin will probably disagree with the most outrageous of these allegations . But his radicalism has so far not cost him his position .
In fact, as will be shown later, he is at times given considerable political authority . In fact, he was given considerable power .
 Russia saw its intervention in Ukraine as a way of striking back. This interpretation of recent history is an important part of the explanation why Russia saw it as a strike back .
 Frolov: striking back over Ukraine should not only be seen as a reactive policy . Frolova: Striking back is not only seen as reactive policy, it is a proactive policy .
 Crimea intervention had at times been a straightjacket for the Russian leadership . Up until the Crimea intervention, maintaining the illusions of joint values with the West had been a problem .
 Russian popular support is stronger than at the previous two, according to the Russian public . This is the third axiom, the third in a row, that Russian support is strong .
 The Russian population seems to buy the leadership’s interpretation of postSoviet history . They think Russia is strong enough to take the chance of standing up to the West .
 A ﬁnal point has surfaced in much of the Western commentary on Crimea and Donbas . Russia could attack Ukraine when it had signed several international treaties that guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity .
 Russians tend to give priority to what they see as just over what they think as legal. One possible explanation may be that Russians see as legal .
B Berman suggested as far back as 1950 that in Russian legal and political tradition, justice outranks the letter of the law . Berman suggested in the 1950s that in the Russian legal, political tradition.
 Russian journalist Konstantin Ranks has noticed that when discussing with Balts and the Finns, these will always refer to the agreements Russia has signed . Ranks: "When discussing with, for example, Balts, and Finns"
 Russians will tend to emphasize what they see as fair and just. Russians, on the other hand, will prefer what they view as fair .
 This legal and cultural tradition may also be part of the explanation for the use of force . This legal tradition is also part of a cultural tradition .
 The procedure of foreign policy-making concerns both the questions of who and how .
 The ‘who’ is a question of individuals and groups and their relative strength within the political leadership. The “who�’s’ who’is a question.
 The ‘how’ concerns in which decisions are made, such as the size of the decision-making body, the role of the president and whether there are distinct rules or institutionalized procedures for how to make decisions .
 The ‘how’ additionally includes such questions as how long the decision took and whether it was one major or several smaller decisions . The � ‘How’ also includes questions as to how long it took.
 Two conclusions seem justiﬁed regarding the ‘who’ question . Based on the empirical information detailed below, two conclusions seem to be justi ﬁing .
 This did not necessarily, as expected, prevent signiﬁcant difference of opinion, according to theories of group-think . This is not necessarily as expected as expected by theories.
 Federalnaia Sluzhba Bezopasnosti's dominance within the political leadership may be one part of the explanation for the decision to use military force .
 Putin himself states that very few individuals were involved in the decision . In the Russian regime’s 2015 celebratory ﬁlm about their annexation of Crimea, Putin says .
 The decision on Crimea was taken by a small group on the eve of the ending of the Sochi Olympics .
 There were differences of opinion when it came to the use of force in Crimea . The Crimea region has been in the Crimea region for years .
 Former Kremlin insider Gleb Pavloskii says decision-making on the Donbas has become even more difficult .
 Crimea's decision-making was still dominant in the case of Crimea . From about May 2014 everything changed, from about April 2014 .
 Among them were Ukrainian and Russian business men attached to different parts of the Kremlin apparatus and to different individuals within Putin’s closest circle .
 Even the governors of certain southern Russian counties tried to weigh in .
 Since the group that made the decision on Crimea was so small, one may question whether considerations of bureaucratic politics can have any explanatory power .
Four former Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti /FSB of the KGB/FSB. Only one individual not with a KGB orFSB past, the FSB may be seen as one of the reasons for the use of force
 Trigger-happy chekisty dismissing the arguments of risk averse and reluctant military would be nothing new in Kremlin decision-making .
 Yurii Andropov won the ﬁght against Chief of the General Staff, Nikolay Ogarkov, on the decision on whether or not to send troops into Afghanistan .
 Andropov supported by Minister of Defence Dmitrii Ustinov, 9.9 was certain of a quick military victory .
 The military thought this assessment wildly optimistic . The military, under Ogarkov, thought it was wildly optimistic.
 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov does not seem to have been party to any of the major decisions on Ukraine . The study is based on a study by the U.S. government .
Group-think is a signiﬁcant danger of group-think . Security services are the most powerful security services in the world .
 Russian observers paint a more nuanced picture of Kremlin decision-making . Russian observers, on the other hand, paint a less nuanced picture .
 Aleksei Venediktov insists that there are often radically differing views within Putin’s close circle .
 The small group that took the decision to use force against Ukraine may have been very homogenous . If Venediktov is right, they were not necessarily very isolated or all in agreement .
 I was once allowed to be present at some of the closed meetings, and also to read the minutes afterwards . You know, you know, I was one of the people who was allowed to attend .
 Venediktov’s observations may be representative, he says . It may be more the political weight of the FSB than the absence of alternative views that led to the decision to use force in Ukraine .
 Former Kremlin insider Pavlovskii claims that Putin during his presidency has become more and more the latter . He says that Putin's popularity has increased in recent years .
 According to him, Putin has created ‘a room for himself’ above the decision-making structures where no one else is allowed .
 Decision-making style may in particular have been the case when it came to policy towards Ukraine .
 This does not suggest a president who actively engages in heavy discussion and collective decision-making . But instead one who mostly listens to the arguments of others and then makes the decision in solitude .
 It is not clear whether this mechanism is more or less likely than the alternative to increase the chances of radical or risky decisions .
 There seems to be a signiﬁcant difference between Crimea and Donbas .
 Putin and his closest advisers still had a relatively long time to ponder what to do if Yanukovych fell . The Ukrainian Maidan was not foreseen, and the Kremlin did not become convinced that Yanukovych would fall until 20 February 2014 .
 Zygar reports that ‘krym nash’ became a daily topic in the Kremlin already in the autumn of 2013 . ‘Krymnash” became a Daily topic in 2013 .
 Crimea appears to have been enough time to prepare both what political and what military actions to take. In terms of Crimea there appears to be enough time.
 Decision-making on Donbas seems to have followed an altogether different trajectory . Donbas has had a different trajectory than Donbas .
 Putin had mentioned Crimea and the East together in Bucharest in 2008 as unacceptable to become NATO territory . Current available sources paint a more blurred picture of Kremlin thinking .
 The full details of Russia’s role in the eastern uprising are still not available . The full information is still not known .
Both Donetsk and Luhansk were largely local initiatives, according to current evidence . One interpretation is that both the uprisings in Donetsk and the one in Slaviansk was not .
 'Little green men' in Luhansk and Donetsk would probably have been solved peacefully if the protesters had not arrived there .
Independent Ukrainian journalist Inna Zolotukhina claims to have seen GRU operatives in Slaviansk at the time of the rebellion .
 Strelkov coordinated his activities in Slaviansk with Sergei Glazev, the former mentioned Putin economics adviser .
 If true, the Kremlin was directly party to the Slaviansk rebellion from the beginning . If that is true, it would be the first time the Kremlin had been involved in the rebellion .
 Strelkov had turned Donetsk into a city at war, the Kremlin became more active after the war .
 Putin gave Donbas operators a degree of freedom of manoeuvre by Putin in order to see what they could achieve .
 The Donbas policy should be seen against the background that the use of force in Crimea had been such a success, says the author .
 If this is the case, then developments until July 2014 may have been seen to vindicate this assumption . If that is the cases, then it could be seen tovindicate that assumption .
 The initial Ukrainian response was not very potent . The rebels took over more and more territory, and the initial Ukraine response was less potent .
 The Ukrainian counter-offensive became much more efﬁcient. In late July, on the other hand, the Ukrainiancounter-offensive become much moreef��ácient . On the other side, the Ukraine counter- offensive became more e
 By mid-August, the possibility of a Ukrainian military victory over the rebels had become a reality .
 By then considerable resources had already been invested, and Kremlin political appetites had probably grown . By then, by then considerable money had been invested. But by then some resources had also been invested .
 Investigative journalists in Russian newspaper Novaia Gazeta claim time factor played a signiﬁcant role in the Russian decision not to back down .
 Crimea was a relatively calculated decision based on enough time to evaluate potential consequences and conduct both military and political contingency planning . Based on this, admittedly scant, evidence, we may speculate that Crimea was relatively calculated .
 The decision to use force in Donbas, on the other hand, may have been more of the ‘mission creep’ type .
 A mixture of trial and error led to a situation where one suddenly, under great time pressure, had to decide on whether to give it all up or escalate .
 An analysis of the reasons why Russia used force in Ukraine would be incomplete without an attempt to examine Putin as a decision-maker . Putin’s personality is a key figure in Russia's decision-making .
 The inferences made, however, should be read as potential causes for action, not as ﬁrm research .
 Some qualiﬁed interpretation is still possible, based on what Putin has said and done, according to what others with access to him have revealed .
 Putin’s desire to stay in power; Putin as a risk-taker; and Putin as an emotional and improvisatorial decision-maker . Putin as emotional and improvised decision-making .
 One caveat is that the section will not deal speciﬁcally with Putin's general world view .
 Putin may of course hold his own personal varieties of the three axioms presented there . But most of what he has said and done since he became president suggests that his world view is not signiﬁcantly different .
 This is especially true in autocratic regimes, such as the one in Russia . This is particularly true in the Russian regime .
 The legal protection of leaders who leave positions of power is so weak. An important reason is that the legal protection for leaders leaving power is weak .
Politicians who leave ofﬁce risk the loss of both freedom and property when no longer in of of of�áce. Thus, politicians who leave.
 Putin has himself expressed fear of what might happen to him when he at some point leaves power .
 The 1993 standoff between parliament and president in Russia had a strong impact on Putin . The standoff between Parliament and President Putin was a strong influence on Putin.
 Putin's decision to use force against Ukraine also can be explained by a desire to remain in ofﬁce . The question is whether Putin’s decision to fight Ukraine also explains why he did it .
 This is the claim of among others the Russian opposition leader Aleksandr Navalny and also some Western analysts . The claim is also claimed by some Russian opposition leaders .
 Putin’s popularity in the Russian population was falling steadily until Crimea. What can be established is that Putin's popularity in Russia is falling steadily .
 Fear of losing power was one of the reasons for the use of force. This fact is not by itself evidence enough to prove that fear was the reason for using force .
After all, 61% approval rating is still pretty good by international standards . After all, it's still good by International standards .
 We seem to be talking about a phenomenon that is more a correlation of variables than a casual explanation at the moment .
 The staying in power hypotheses makes sense logically, but so far it cannot be satisfactorily conﬁrmed by empirical data . The staying-in-power hypotheses make sense logically. But so far they cannot be satisfying by empiricalData .
 Apparently, Putin did not believe in Western economic sanctions if he decided to take Crimea .
 There was a real chance that Ukraine would ﬁght back, and nobody knew how the West would react .
 The concern here is both with Putin’s personality in terms of taking risk, and with the risk-taking in this particular situation .
 This probably has more to do with intimidating opponents than it has to be introspection . This has to do more with introspection than with intimidation .
 Aleksei Venediktov, for example, has an impression of Putin as a very careful man .
 The fact of risk-taking as a particular trait of Putin’s personality is too uncertain to be used as an explanation for Ukraine's decision to use force against Ukraine .
 The young Putin's personality may be different in the now 63 years old Putin . Even if this indeed was a trait of the young Putin’s personality, it may not be a trait .
 The personality trait of risk acceptance is almost impossible to distinguish from the potential use of the image of risk Acceptance for instrumental purposes .
 Putin may have released a heightened willingness to take risk after the incident at hand . Putin is a particularly risk-acceptant individual, despite questions about him .
 Putin and Russia suffered from Euromaidan may have been bigger than at ﬁrst assumed .
 Yanukovych refused to sign the association agreement with the EU in Vilnius in November 2013 . He ofﬁcially stated that this was only a postponement .
 It should in no way be seen as a major change of Ukrainian foreign policy. It should not be considered as a change of Ukraine's foreign policy .
 The gathered oligarchs could not believe their own ears . Ihor Kolomoiskiy took Yanukovych aside to check whether he had actually meant what he said .
 Putin thought he had secured one of the most important geopolitical victories of his career . It is possible that Putin, after relentless pressure and daily conversations with Yanukovych over a long period of time, had secured a victory .
 Ukraine's president has been in power since 2000 . He may have thought that he had been able to stop the westward drift of Ukraine .
People tend to be more risk acceptant when faced with the prospects loss than gain, according to Kahneman .
 Putin had gained something extremely valuable in Ukraine, only to be faced with the likely rapid loss of it all because of Maidan .
 Putin's use of force may have increased risk acceptance, according to prospect theory . This would have increased Putin’s risk acceptance and become part of the reason why he decided to use force .
 Former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, William Burns. Burns is a former United States ambassador to Russia . Burns was a former ambassador to the Russian city of Moscow . Burns is now a senior member of the United States.
 The decision-making of the Donbas seems to support such a conclusion . Especially the above analysed decision- making.
 A clear vision of the end-state is a precondition for rational decision-making, says the author . The author says it is a "precaondition" for rational decisions .
Another non-rationalistic explanation for the use of force is emotions . Another non- rationalistic explanation is emotions and emotions .
 West seems to drive even further the disintegration of the former Soviet world with attempts to ‘snitch’ Ukraine, that may have triggered this emotion even stronger .
 The annexation of Crimea may also partly be explained as an angry emotional reaction by Putin .
 The three axioms of one nation, popular uprisings as a weapon used by the West, and 20 years of humiliation of Russia, form the ideological and interest-based background for the decision to use force against Ukraine .
 Russia's military force against Ukraine would not have been used without conviction, says Russian leader . Russia's leadership would not be able to use military force if not to the same extent in the Russian population .
 As long as the axioms constitute the dominating discourse, they will have explanatory power, says John Sutter .
 The truth is the established truth, and dissent may have serious consequences for those who express it. They are the establishedtruth, says the author .
 The status of the axioms as causes as causes does not preclude them from being used instrumentally . But it does not prevent them from also being used instruments .
 The Russian leadership probably sees that insisting on these axioms is useful both in order to intimidate the West and to conceal additional utility-based motives .
Leaked Kremlin policy document suggests that a utilitarian agenda was also present .
 Control over human and industrial resources in Eastern Ukraine and geostrategic military advantages may have been additional motives for the use of force . Control of human andindustrial resources in eastern Ukraine could have been a motive .
 Such arguments would not necessarily serve the Russian case if voiced in public . However, such arguments wouldn't serve the Russians case, if voiced.
 Using military force against Ukraine would not have been an automatic decision . Still, even with strong ideological and interest-based motives for not tolerating Euromaidan and its possible consequences, using military force wouldn't have been a automatic decision.
 There were considerable risks, even if some of them, such as economic sanctions from the West, may have been underestimated . There were significant risks, including some of the West's sanctions .
 Three to four factors in particular seem to have made the difference in the choice between military action or not .
First, dominance in decision-making circles of people from the FSB is important . First, the dominance in the decision- making circles is important, says FSB chief . Second, the power of the people from FSB has been shown to be important .
 alternative opinions were most likely present in the deliberations, sources say . As the sources consulted here describe, alternative opinions are likely to be present .
 Bureaucratic politics, with its focus on the relative strength of different sub-national actors for policy output, may be more relevant . The focus on sub- national actors may also be relevant .
 This is eerily reminiscent of the deliberations before the 1979 Soviet decision to invade Afghanistan . The Soviet decision was made in 1979 .
 Putin could have thought that he had secured one of the biggest geopolitical triumphs of his career by halting Ukraine’s drift to the West .
 Yanukovych's overthrow looked like it would be lost because of the Yanukovych overthrow . Then, just as he was starting to enjoy the victory, it all looked like he would be losing .
 Prospect theory suggests that people get more risk acceptant when facing loss then when facing gain . People are more risk accepted when facing a loss then facing gain.
 There is also the issue of Putin himself being a particularly risk-acceptant person, but as discussed above, this assumption can be questioned .
 The sources of these emotions are of course the axioms presented above . But an emotionally cooler president than Putin could have been less swayed by them .
 It is conceivable that emotions played a larger role in Crimea than in the case of Donbas . It is possible that emotions play a bigger role in the Crimea case than in Crimea .
 Putin’s desire to thwart the downward trend of his popular approval rating may also have played a role . Putin's desire to thwarted the downward Trend of his approval rating could also be a role.
 The argument is consistent with the timing of events, and it involves the content of the Russian social contract . This argument is similar to the time of events .
Evidence in support of Putin's argument demands an insight into Putin's thinking not yet available .
 The argument is logically convincing, but so far not sufﬁciently empirically supported . So far, the argument is not convincing .
 This is a case study of the decisions to use military force to annex Crimea and to be involved in a popular rebellion against Kiev in Donbas . This is the first time military force has been used in Crimea since Crimea was annexed by Ukraine .
 There are limits to what other countries in Russia's neighbourhood can learn from Russia's experience .
Russian geopolitical ideology and interest-based calculations are relevant for more countries than Ukraine, study finds .
 Adapted to the individualities of other regional contexts, they may help interpreting Russian policy elsewhere .
 Sergei Shoigu, Chief of the General Staff Valreiy Gerasimov and Vladimir Zarudniskyi spoke at the Moscow Conference on International Security 2014 .
 Ustinov was a representative of the defence industry rather than the Soviet military . He had a military background, but also had a defence background .
 This was an important distinction in terms of political outlook in the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union was the most powerful country in the world .
