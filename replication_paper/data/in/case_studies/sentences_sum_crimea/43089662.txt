 Article the International Framing the Ukraine Communication Gazette 2019, Vol. The Ukrainian Communication Gazette .
 Informed by peace journalism and constructive journalism, it investigates how Russian and German shows frame the Ukraine crisis . It investigates how Russia and German show frame the crisis and to what extent constructive and destructive frames are used .
 Qualitative content analysis of 20 shows enables examination of frame content and their constructive or destructive character . The 20 shows include some of the world's most popular shows .
 constructive frames address situational causal interpretations and constructive problem treatments . destructive frames blame one party for the crisis and apply either no treatment or a destructive one .
 The country's shows include more constructive frames in different periods of the crisis . Large parts of both strands of the debates are destructive in character .
 The Ukraine crisis is an ongoing conﬂict both inside the Ukraine and in international relations between Russia and the West . The U.S., the Western European key countries, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union alliances have
As the protest escalated to serious violent clashes, Yanukovych and other government oﬃcials were formed . An interim government with both pro-EU and radical right-wing politicians was formed .
 Russia responded to the change in power structures in Ukraine by incorporating Crimea . The population of Crimea is 60% Russian and the Russian Black Sea Fleet is stationed in Ukraine . Russia has a population of 60% Russia .
 Merkel represented the position of the EU and the U.S. in peace negations in Minsk dealing with the Eastern Ukraine military conﬂict . The new Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist movements supported by the Russian military.
 Despite the signing of two ceaseﬁre agreements in Minsk in September 2014 and February 2015, the violence in Eastern Ukraine continues .
 From its beginning, the crisis has had an international dimension concerning relations between Russia on one side and Western countries on the other .
 Confrontations have repeatedly manifested in mutual assignments of blame, economic sanctions imposed by the EU and the United States and travel bans .
In the Ukraine crisis, compromises between the parties on the international level and inside the country were likely aﬀected by a constructive or destructive way of framing the crisis in the media .
 German-Russian relations proved to be of crucial importance to crisis management . This study focuses on the framing of the crisis in both countries' media .
 To capture the story line expressed in a frame as well as its constructive or destructive character, we integrate criteria for constructive journalism into frame methodology . The story line is expressed in the frame and its constructive and destructive character .
 The analysis looks at in-depth debates on television political talk shows that are considered to be important inter-media agenda-setters . It provides frames on the crisis in their respective media environments .
 The article examines how the Ukraine crisis is framed in political talk shows in the two conﬂicting countries . It examines how constructive or destructive the frames are, considering their consequences .
 A qualitative content analysis of a sample of Russian and German talk shows was performed . To answer these questions, a quantitative content analysis was performed.
 The media's active role in constructive crisis communication and crisis management has been acknowledged in research programs such as peace journalism, positive journalism and constructive journalism .
 The media should avoid cynicism and instead motivate participation in the democratic process, writes John Sutter .
 Criteria developed to assign media coverage to war or peace frames . Criteria focus on use or absence of emotional, victory-orientated, demonizing and victimizing language .
 Lynch and McGoldrick describe peace journalism as an accurate and conﬂict-sensitive way of framing stories . They say only a small share of media coverage fulﬁls peace frame criteria .
 Drawing on generic instead of thematic frames, this approach fails to consider a nuanced classiﬁcation or explore the story lines presented by the media about crises .
Diﬀerent from that, constructive journalism (Gyldensted, 2015; Haagerup, 2014; McIntyre, 2015) provides a more realistic and viable approach to the analysis of media coverage in times of crises .
 Instead of prescribing to journalists what issues they should report on, it refers to how issues should be presented . It refers to what issues the journalists should present .
 Instead of blaming one side, it sheds light on problems, it promotes a deeper understanding of the causes of the respective crisis or conﬂict .
Existing frame analyses on international crises give evidence of a destructive style in news coverage . But criteria for constructive journalism have not yet been operationalized systematically .
 The Cold War frame places events within a geopolitical power struggle between Russia and Western countries and alliances . Russia and the West are at odds in the Cold War .
 This article analyses frames on the Ukraine crisis in political talk show discussions in Russia and Germany . Research questions questions questions about the concept of constructive journalism .
Two research questions that address the content of frames as well as their constructive or destructive character .
 talk show discussions are supposed to follow the perspective of national political elites . Talk show discussions often follow the view of the political elite .
 We therefore expect to ﬁnd basically destructive frames on the crisis that deal with blaming one party and highlight confrontational treatment recommendations .
 Method to answer the research questions, a qualitative content analysis of German and Russian TV talk shows is conducted .
 The aim of the study is to identify frames that structure the debate on the Ukraine crisis in both countries’ talk shows during the three periods of the crisis deﬁned above .
 The study analyses four prominent political talk shows in Russian and ﬁve in German TV that are broadcasted on major national television channels in the evening . The study could be retrieved from the channels’ online archives .
 The Russian shows stem from the state-owned channel Pmpph~ 1 and the channel MRC . The channel is owned by statecontrolled ﬁrm Gazprom .
 Both are bound by principles of ideological and political pluralism according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the Law of the Russia Federation on Mass Media .
 The shows on Russia-1 are Omjhmhi, Qneuh and Cmpioeplz . The International Communication Gazette 81 is selected .
 The German shows are from public service TV that stands for information and quality . The Broadcasting Board consists of all major political parties and societal institutions .
 Article 5 of the German basic law and Interstate Treaty on Broadcasting and Telemedia highlight the values of balanced coverage and plurality of opinions in public service broadcasting .
 The moderator directs questions to guests from politics, economy, media, science and civil society . The moderator also enables an exchange of opinions and dispute between guests .
 Short ﬁlms provoke debates and provide background information . Comments via email or Facebook are frequently included .
 Russian shows are characterized by a large number of speakers and rapid turntaking during discussions . Russian shows, however, are characterized as characterized by large numbers of speakers .
 This diﬀers from German shows, wherein about ﬁve guests participate in each episode . The shows feature guests from around the world .
 The time period under study starts in November 2013, and ends in December 2015 . It includes the three crisis phases of the Maidan protests, the Russian incorporation of Crimea and the Eastern Ukraine military conﬂict .
 The last peak was in February 2015 during peace negotiations in Minsk . The subsequent violation of the ceaseﬁre was the last peak of the peace talks .
 The Ukraine crisis received less attention on German talk shows in February 2014, at the time when the issue had gained considerable international importance . In comparison, the Ukraine crisis featured in only 32 broadcasts and starting later, in March 2014, in Germany .
 Most shows were broadcast in February and March 2014 during the struggle for Crimea . Most of the shows were shown during Crimea's struggle for Ukraine .
 Further peaks, as in Russia, arose in December 2014 and in February 2015 . Further peaks in Russia arose in January and February 2015.
 During period I, no German show covered the Ukraine crisis, but discussions in the later shows continuously refer to the Maidan protests .
 The framing of the crisis is inﬂuenced by guests participating in the shows . The time frame of the selected shows is also in the frame .
 The dominance of politicians indicates a high presence of oﬃcial frames in shows in shows from both countries .
 Most of the guests stem from Russia in Russian shows and from Germany in German shows . Foreign representatives are regularly considered .
 The selection of guests might go along with predominantly national frames . The selection will be a selection of guest guests .
 The analysis inductively generates thematic frames by systemizing and condensing frames uttered in the chosen content . Coding procedure.
Entman’s framing approach. Therefore, criteria for constructive journalism are operationalized using the framing approach .
 As problem deﬁnitions ‘often virtually predetermine the rest of the frame’ It is considered to be the most important frame element .
 The International Communication Gazette has been criticized for lacking conceptual clarity . It is an analysis framework that is used frequently in empirical 74 the International Communications Gazette 81 media and communication studies .
 constructive frames emphasize situational causal interpretation and focus on problem treatments that enable de-escalation and crisis reconciliation . destructive frames address personal causal interpretations and either provide no ideas for problem treatments or support confrontational treatments .
 The guests’ statements in the shows are coded by two German and two Russian coders using the frame elements as the central categories .
After the coding of a part of the material, frames that had already emerged were grouped together .
 We ﬁnally structured the frames into frames into frame groups based on their thematic content .
 According to the emphasized frame elements, we ﬁnally diﬀerentiated between constructive and destructive frames . According to this article, we are more likely to be more constructive than destructive .
 In analysing the sample of 10 Russian and 10 German talk show broadcasts, we found 12 diﬀerent frames for Russia and 13 frames for Germany .
 For both strands of the debate, frames are grouped by their problem deﬁnition and distinguished according to the other three frame elements . The situational causal interpretation, the personal causal interpretation and the problem treatment are assigned to one of the three time periods of the Ukraine crisis .
 Frames on the situation inside Ukraine refer to the Maidan protests and the military conﬂict in Eastern Ukraine . They also connect diﬀerent periods of the crisis in a comprehensive story line .
 Among the Russian talk shows, four frames address the political destabilization of Ukraine as a problem .
 Yanukovych is accused of a failed foreign policy that tried ‘to play Russia and the EU oﬀ against each other’
 To avoid the immanent collapse of the country, the frame calls all conﬂicting parties to restore the country’s unity peacefully in new democratic parliamentary elections .
 An opposing view is expressed by the frame Antidemocratic Movement, which is used with reference to the Maidan protests . The Antidemocrat Movement is called the Antidemocrats .
 It accuses the Maidan protesters of an ‘anti-constitutional, anti-democratic rebellion’ (Sergey Kurginyan)
 Kiev government stresses that the new Kiev government lacks legitimacy and disregards minority rights . It stresses that new Kievgovernment lacks legitimacy .
 In the later period of the Ukraine crisis, this frame is complemented by the frame Freedom Struggle against Kiev’s Hegemony . The new Kiev government blames the new Kievgovernment for disregarding diversity in Ukraine and for discriminating against the population in Eastern Ukraine .
 Both frames call Russia to engage as protective force for the people in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine . Both frames are similar to those of Russia and Ukraine .
 This includes ideas ranging from supporting the movement in Eastern Ukraine to plans for an independent Eastern Ukrainian state . This includes plans for a state of independent Eastern Ukraine .
 Russia’s Sphere of Inﬂuence stresses that the destabilization of the Ukrainian political system results from Russia patronizing Ukraine . In contrast, the frame stresses that Russia's Sphere of inﬁence stresses Russia's role in Ukraine .
 As a problem treatment, it is claimed that Russia should respect the country as a sovereign state .
 The frames Freedom Struggle against Kiev's Hegemony and Russia's Sphere of Inﬂuence have equivalents in German shows . The frames are similar to those shown in Germany .
 The frame Civil Uprising that has similarities to the frame Russia’s Sphere of Inﬂuence in the Russian shows takes an opposing view .
 The frame calls upon the new Ukraine government to display responsible behaviour towards its citizens and to preserve the country’s unity .
Third political frame in German talk shows refers predominantly to current war events in Eastern Ukraine .
 Separatist Aggression engages in blaming separatists in Eastern Ukraine for violence . It takes a critical stance on Russia for tolerating or even supporting separatist movements .
 The frame includes warnings about supplying arms to Ukraine for selfdefence . It is based on the argument that this would give Russia the pretext for overt military action .
 Frames that deﬁne Ukraine’s weak economy as the main problem of the crisis refer to the Maidan protests . These frames are also used in later time periods of the Crisis .
 Two frames come to opposing conclusions regarding the question of whether and how Russia should become involved in Ukrainian economic problems . In Russian talk shows, two frames come out on the issue .
 Bottomless Pit emphasizes that the country’s economy could suﬀer from persistently accommodated incompetence and corruption . In contrast, the frame Bottomlesspit emphasizes the country's economy couldsu�aeer .
 The frame blames Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs and ‘colonial powers’ for destroying the country’s economic interests .
 Russia should concentrate on its own economy rather than investing in Ukraine, it is stated . It is stated that as long as oligarchs’ inﬂuence on politics continues, Russia shouldn't invest in Ukraine .
 German talk shows problematize the suﬀering of citizens due to violence in the Maidan protests and the war in Eastern Ukraine . The talk also discusses economic and political problems in Ukraine .
 Human Interest points to the structural complexity within Ukraine, including diﬀerent ethnic and religious groups drifting into a spiral of aggression .
 In Russian as well as in German shows, only two frames on the situation inside Ukraine can be classiﬁed as constructive .
 Russia’s Sphere of Inﬂuence and Stabilize Ukraine avoid a personal causal interpretation and call for enabling Ukraine to gain political and economic stability . In Russian shows, the frames of Russia's Sphere of inשּׁce and Stablize Ukraine are not
 Ukrainian dependence on Russia and the tense political situation inside the country endanger its stability and capacity to act . Ukraine's reliance on Russia is a threat to its stability, according to the government .
 This is similar to the frames Civil Uprising and Human Interest in German talk shows . This is the same as the frames of Civil Uprise and Human interest in German talks shows .
 Russian shows German shows Constructive frames Russia’s Sphere of Influence Civil Uprising Stabilize Ukraine Human Interest in-between Bottomless Pit Economic Structure Destructive frames Yanukovych Lost Ukraine Separatist Aggression Antidemocratic Movement Freedom Struggle against Freedom Struggle . Other frames that are
 Bottomless Pit calls for ignoring Ukraine's problems and falls thus as between constructive and destructive in character .
 In contrast, the frames Yanukovych Lost Ukraine, Antidemocratic Movement and Freedom Struggle against Kiev’s Hegemony are destructive .
 The attribution of blame with the treatment recommendation of intervention in Ukraine is to say, legitimizing military action in the name of human rights and political stability . They all combine the attribution of blames with the recommendation of Intervention in Ukraine .
 In German talk shows, frames that are not classiﬁed as constructive address blame to the new Kiev government for violating minority rights .
 The separatist movements in Eastern Ukraine blame Russia for supporting separatists and keeping Ukraine in a state of economic dependence . Even more frequently, they blame the separatist movements for aggression and Russia for support .
 The frame Economic Structure entails a constructive treatment recommendation that supports economic help for Ukraine . However, it also includes a constructive recommendation that support economic help.
 Separatist Aggression and Freedom Struggle against Kiev’s Hegemony follow a clearly destructive logic. While this frame falls between constructive and destructive, the frame falls from constructive to destructive .
 They combine blaming of one party with appeals to EU countries to enter confrontation . They combine the blaming of the one party and appeals to other EU countries.
 Russian shows tend to frame the Maidan protests in a destructive way . With reference to the periods of the Ukraine crisis, Russian shows often frame the protests as destructive .
 German shows frame the military conﬂict in Eastern Ukraine destructively destructively while framing the Maidan protests in a more constructive way . German shows Frame the military Con�ctict in eastern Ukraine.
 Most of the frames, however, were addressed before and after this event . The frames provide a broader story line for interpreting confrontations between Russia and West .
 Most of the frames with a focus on international politics reﬂect on the global players’ responsibility for the crisis . Most of these frames are focused on the international players' responsibility for crisis .
 The EU is blamed for immoral behaviour motivated by an economic need for ‘low-cost labor’ (Afanasios Ciolas-Avgerinos, Greek journalist, Omjhmhi, from Ukraine.
 The new Ukrainian government should resist and re-orient its politics from the EU to a close relationship to Russia, writes David Cameron .
 The frame US’s Attack against Russia focuses on the role of the United States in the crisis .
 U.S. troops in Ukraine are trying to further escalate the conﬂict. It states that United States troops in the Ukraine are attempting to escalate the Con�ctict .
 Russia's frame prompts Russia to resist by unifying the Slavic states and to consider military actions .
 This frame had already been used during the Maidan protests when Russian pressure on the Yanukovych government was criticized .
 It became most prominent during and after the incorporation of Crimea . However, it became more prominent after Crimea's incorporation .
 The frame emphasizes the need to negotiate with Russia . It also includes the treatment recommendation of initiating or intensifying economic sanctions against Russia .
 Two frames in the German shows interpret Russian behaviour during all three periods of the Ukraine crisis . In addition, two frames in German show Russian behaviour as a reaction to enlargement of the EU and NATO .
 The frame The West Is Expanding refrains from attributing blame to individual countries or politicians . The frame is the West's attempt to reduce blame for individual countries .
 Russia has a more structural ignorance of Russia after 1990, it says . Instead, it explains the causes of the problem in terms of more structural Western ignorance of Russian .
 The frame does not suspect the EU or the US of following an imperialistic strategy . But it insists that the West should admit to its own mistakes .
 Russia blames U.S. for prioritizing economic self-interest rather than political common sense . Russian actions in Crimea are a reaction to Western actions rather than as acts of aggression, it says .
 The frame Great Power Politics has a stronger focus on changes in the international system of states . In contrast, the frame has a strong focus on changing the international systems of states.
 It is expressed in Russian as well as in German talk shows during all periods of the crisis . It is also expressed in Russia and in Germany during the crisis and points at pressure from global players .
 As a treatment, the establishment of a multipolar global structure with more political de-centralization is advocated . The establishment of the multipolar world structure is advocated.
 In the case of Ukraine, the frame calls for both the West and Russia to engage in de-escalation and negotiations about Ukraine .
 Frames on national politics reﬂect the situation in each country with regard to readiness for confrontation on the international level . They are addressed ﬁrst and foremost to the incorporation of Crimea and the military con�ict in Eastern Ukraine .
 In the German shows, two frames address options for national and Western politics towards Russia after the incorporation of Crimea . The German shows also discuss options for Russia after Crimea's incorporation .
 Both problematize the insuﬃcient power of the Western alliances, NATO and the EU to deal with global problems, for example, in Syria .
 The frame Realpolitik highlights the need for cooperation with Russia in international politics . The frame also rejects any moral evaluation of Russian politics .
 As a solution, this frame advocates a more pragmatic realpolitik to restore peace in Europe and relations with Russia .
 The frame West Must Show Strength follows the idea that a hesitant attitude on the part of Western governments is the main cause of the crisis .
 This frame calls for a show of strength, meaning sanctions against Russia as well as deterrence, such as increased NATO presence in Baltic and arms supplies to Ukraine .
 A ﬁnal group of frames takes media and public opinion into account . It refers in Russian shows to all three crisis periods and in German shows to international conﬂicts about the incorporation of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine .
 In Russia, the frame Anti-Russian Propaganda entails the idea of an information war against Russia not only inside Ukraine but also inside the U.S. and EU countries .
 It is stated that disinformation is launched by Ukrainian elites and Western stakeholders who hold control in mass media in their respective countries .
 Russia should engage in the information war by actively communicating to the various countries’s publics. Russia should actively communicate to various countries' publics .
 Russian Propaganda rejects any ideas of conspiracy against Russia . In contrast to this, the frame Russian Prop propaganda rejects any idea.
 This frame criticizes Russian media coverage for fostering sentiments against the U.S. over a long 82-year period . This frame also creates a supportive environment for confrontation in foreign policy .
 It does not assign blame for political propaganda but states that German journalists and politicians have problems obtain an overview of the situation and refer to culturally rooted stereotypes .
 Russian Propaganda recognizes at least partial Russian responsibility for the crisis, explained by mistakes in politics and by disinformation . In Russian shows, the frame of the crisis is that Russia is responsible for it .
 Neither addresses any Russian responsibility for the crisis, nor rejects the idea of competition between Russia and the United States and the EU on the other .
 The frame calls for an active de-escalation and is thus classiﬁed as constructive . However, it is motivated by pragmatism only, but it is also motivated by pragmaticism .
 The German debate is similar to the Russian debate, reﬂexive and more pragmatic frames can be found in German shows .
 German Media include a critical view of the Western role in international politics and communication leading to the crisis .
 Instead of attributing blame, they explain the problems via a more situational causal interpretation . The problems are more likely to be caused by situational causal interpretations .
More destructive frames address personal causal interpretations that refer to only one side in the crisis . More destructive frames are more likely to refer to one side, rather than one side .
 In Russian talk shows, these frames blame Western politics and Western media for triggering the crisis .
 EU, US, US and Anti-Russian Propaganda support negotiations, but instead they call Russia and politics in Ukraine to resist and thus enter confrontation with the West .
 Violation of International Law and West Must Show Strength. In the German shows, the frames blame Russia for the crisis and support the destructive problem treatments of imposing economic sanctions .
 It blames the U.S. for aggressive and illegitimate behaviour in Ukraine and thus legitimizes Russian actions in Crimea and in Eastern Ukraine .
 constructive frames from shows in both countries refer basically to the escalation of international tensions during the incorporation of Crimea .
 Destructive frames follow a broader story line that makes sense of all three periods of the Ukraine crisis as part of a global conﬂict between Russia and the West that is a continuation of the Cold War .
 The identiﬁed frames highlight similarities and diﬀerences between the countries’ perspectives on the crisis that help to explain conﬂicts on the international level between Russia and West .
 The Maidan protests, the incorporation of Crimea and the military conﬂict in Eastern Ukraine have been discussed from multiple perspectives in both countries .
 In Russian talk shows, the stability of Ukrainian politics and economy is highly discussed . The shows tend to closely examine the complexities within the country .
 The German debate spends less eﬀort seeking a deeper understanding of the structural problems inside Ukraine . Instead, the German debate places great emphasis on international confrontation and violence in the military conﬂict in Eastern Ukraine .
 Russian shows are more concerned with Russia’s economic and political. 84 the International Communication Gazette 81 capacity to persist in the international crisis and the need to protect Russian minorities .
 The shows have a high share of guests from national politics . They tend to reﬂect on the crisis through the glasses of national foreign policy .
 Some frames in Russian and German shows are similar in their main idea, while diﬀering in important details . The shows thus fail to enable a deeper understanding of the crisis .
 German shows explain the sometimes one-sided coverage in German media by a lack of knowledge and old stereotypes . For example, Russian talk shows suggest a political interest behind perceived Russophobia and anti-Russian sentiments in Western media .
 The responsibility of the EU for the crisis is discussed in German . The Russian debate stresses the EU’s economic interests .
 Considering the constructive and destructive quality of the frames, destructive frames prevail and legitimize confrontational rhetoric and actions in politics . Consider the constructive quality of frames, the frames prevail.
 Russia blames Maidan protesters and Kiev government for anti-democratic actions and discrimination . Russia suspects the West of following a geopolitical and economic strategy against Russia .
 Frames in German shows, in contrast, legitimize sanctions against Russia by denouncing the country for violations of international law .
 Frames that follow principals of constructive journalism by providing solutions for identiﬁed problems are found in both countries’ talk shows .
 Some frames call for de-escalation, negotiations and conﬂict resolution . Russian incorporation of Crimea and the Maidan protests are among the frames .
Questions about each country's own responsibility for the crisis and its capacity to withstand an international conﬂict. They also include questions concerning each country’s own responsibility.
 For politicians, especially frames that explain the Ukraine crisis via great power politics, call for a multipolar global structure with more political de-centralization . For political leaders, such frames are important for peace agreements .
 This is true for frames that emphasize the need to stabilize Ukraine as the primary goal. This is also true for frame that emphasize need to stabilise Ukraine as a primary goal .
 Most of the frames deal with attribution of blame, but it might become rational for politicians to choose the easier path and adapt to this part of the debate by engaging in scapegoating .
 The study demonstrates the importance to analyse both, the content of frames and their constructive or destructive character .
