For months, thousands of protesters gathered in Kyiv's Independence Square to protest Yanukovic's decision . This move marked the beginning of a deep crisis in the country's political history .
Ukraine is separated geographically between Europe and Russia, and so are the people who are divided into two camps – pro-Russian and pro-Western . Later, tensions expanded to Crimea and the eastern Donbas region bordering Russia .
 The Crimean Parliament decided to hold a referendum that would allow Russia to annex Crimea . Despite the protests of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians, Russia illegally annexed Crimea .
Separatists also claim control of eastern Ukraine, including the Donbas region . In February 2014, pro-Russian separatists attacked pro-government troops in Donetsk and Luhansk .
Separatists in Donbas claimed two so-called states, the ‘Donetsk People's Republic’ and ‘Luhansk People'sRepublic’ through a so- called referendum on May 11, 2014 . The two regions are densely populated by people of Russian origin
 The summit did not stop the clashes, but Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe later agreed to a comprehensive cease-fire beginning on July 27, 2020 . The summit was held in Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France .
