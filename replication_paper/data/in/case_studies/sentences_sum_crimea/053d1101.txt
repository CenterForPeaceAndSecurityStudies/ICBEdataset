 The new threat of war over Ukraine resulting from the Russian demands of December 2021 should focus the minds of U.S. and European policymakers on the unsolved dispute that is responsible for much of the tension between Russia and Ukraine .
 The Donbas conflict, which has cost more than 14,000 lives since 2015, is at permanent risk of breaking out again with disastrous results . The conflict is at risk of a repeat of last year's disastrous results.
 A solution to the conflict would contribute greatly to an improvement in wider relations between the West and Russia . By the same token, a solution would contribute to a greater improvement in relations .
 A solution to the conflict is at hand, in the form of the Minsk II agreement of 2015 . It calls for autonomy for a demilitarized Donbas within Ukraine under international guarantees .
 Ukrainian governments and parliaments have refused to take the essential first steps to its implementation . Actually to establish this settlement will take intensive pressure by the United States and its allies on Ukraine .
 A new war between Ukraine and Russia could end only in Ukrainian military defeat, and perhaps in the loss of much larger territories . A new conflict could end in Ukraine's defeat.
 The U.S. would face the choice of either going to war with Russia or leaving Ukraine to its fate . The United States has declared  unwavering support for Ukraine .
 The danger of outright war will not shift Russian policy, because Russia is confident that it would win, says Russia . The danger is not changing Russian policy.
 U.S. and E.U. sanctions against Russia have not worked in the slightest to make Russia accept Ukrainian terms for settling the Donbas and Crimean disputes . The sanctions have been in place for seven years .
 The strength of Russian nationalism means that no conceivable future change of government in Moscow will alter Russiaâs basic approach .
 Ukrainian economic pressure may push Russia toward compromise, but only if Ukraine and the U.S. are also prepared to compromise . The blockade of the Donbas and cutoff of water to Crimea could push Russia to compromise.
 If not, there is an equal risk that Russia will eventually respond to this pressure with force of arms . Russia is facing a growing pressure from the West .
 The unresolved conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the Donbas region represents by far the greatest danger of a new war in Europe . The U.S. and Russia are at the greatest risk of a crisis in relations between the United States and Russia .
 President Biden has made clear that his administration does not intend to fight Russia to defend Ukraine . The Obama administration fought to defending Ukraine in 2014, or the Bush administration in 2008, he said .
Germany and other NATO allies will certainly not go to war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine . Germany and other allies will not be going to war.
 As of 2021, the U.S. has only 26,000 ground troops in Europe . The United States has more than 25,000 troops.
 Russia has more than 10 times that number that it could deploy quickly to fight in Ukraine . Russia has over 10 times the number it can deploy to Ukraine .
 U.S. would probably have to abandon all thought of placing military checks on the expansion of Chinese power in the western Pacific . To prepare seriously for war with Russia would require a colossal redeployment of United States forces to Europe .
 It is emphatically in the interest of the United States, as well as Europe and Ukraine itself, to find a political solution to the Donbas conflict . It is also in the interests of the U.S. and Europe, aswell as Ukraine itself .
 There is no chance whatsoever that such a solution can rest on the present Ukrainian government's demand of the present government to regain the Donbas unconditionally .
 Kiev and Moscow must find a compromise, and Biden administration should help them to do so . Kiev and Russia must find an agreement, and the Biden administration must help them do so, says the author .
This solution is in line with international practice in the solution of separatist disputes, with democratic tradition, and with America’s own federal example . This solution is a solution to separatist disputes with democratic traditions .
 A settlement built on core terms should be endorsed by a Security Council resolution . A United Nations peacekeeping force will be stationed in the Donbas to guarantee the settlement and prevent a new outbreak of violence . A U.N. peacekeeper force will also be stationed to prevent an outbreak of
 The issue of Crimea is different and separate from that of the Donbas, since Russia annexed Crimea shortly after the revolution in Kiev in 2014 .
 There is no ongoing armed conflict in the territory . It is also less dangerous, because there is no current armed conflict .
 Crimea could in principle be shelved for a future generation to solve . It is not essential to solve the Crimean dispute to end the conflict over the Donbas .
 Crimea constitutes another major stumbling block in U.S. relations, carrying the potential for future crises . However, Crimea is also a key part of the relationship .
 A new local referendum would be held under U.N. monitoring and supervision . It would also be linked to a diplomatic compromise with Russia over the independence of Kosovo .
 Such a settlement would represent no real sacrifice for either the U.S. or Ukraine, it would not be a real sacrifice .
 There is no possibility of Ukraine joining NATO or the European Union . So long as the Donbas conflict remains unresolved, there is no chance of joining NATO .
 The ethnic chauvinism that the conflict is helping to increase in Ukraine may in some ways strengthen the country internally against Russia, but it also creates a significant ideological and cultural barrier to E.U. membership .
 If by some miracle the Donbas and Crimea could be returned to unconditional Ukrainian control . The resulting internal tensions in Ukraine would make the country a very dangerous acquisition for NATO and the E.U., and a permanent source of potential conflict with Russia .
 Ukraine has become so important that members of foreign policy establishment have even suggested that the U.S. should be willing to go to war with Russia for the sake of Ukrainian sovereignty .
 The president has declared his guiding light for the middle class . The Biden administration has not explained how such a commitment squares with the U.S. commitment .
 U.S. officials began to care about the fate of the Donbas region only after the end of the Cold War and to a considerable extent after the Ukrainian revolution of 2014 .
 This gradual, never-debated slide into a new and potentially disastrous U.S. commitment forms part of a wider pattern since the end of the Cold War .
 A 1992 memo by Paul Wolfowitz and Lewis Libby advocated U.S. political and military primacy across the entire globe . The memo became the standard operating procedure of all subsequent administrations .
 U.S. primacy in every region of the world was bound to provoke hostile reactions, says John Sutter . The irruption of United States power into regions on their borders and affecting what they regard as their vital interests .
 All real power is to be judged not on a global and absolute basis, but on a local and relative one . In the end, all real power should be judged on a national and relative basis .
 A state is willing and able to bring to bear on a given issue relative to what it is willing to bear . That is, it depends on the degree of power that a state is willingness to bear. That is the power of a state that is willing, able to
 Russia's willingness to bring power to bear in Ukraine has much deeper roots than that of the United States . Russian and U.S. interests in Ukraine have deep roots in Russia, the U.N. says .
 Ukrainian servicemen ride on armored vehicles near Slaviansk September 3, 2014 .
This is not to justify Russia’s actions in the region since 2014, any more than acknowledging permanent U.S. interests in Central America .
 Great powers will inevitably take a strong interest in regions on their borders and react with suspicion and hostility to rival great powers .
 U.S. policymakers should think deeply, and inform and consult the United States electorate before challenging Russia in a region on its borders and vital to Russian interests, says Peter Bergen .
 The U.S. and allied strategy of creating a "Europe whole and free" implies the expulsion of Russia from Europe . No Russian government, of any political stripe, will ever accept the move .
 The phrase "Europe whole and free" implies a hard geopolitical, economic, and cultural frontier between Ukraine and Belarus on the one side and Russia on the other . The phrase also implies that the two sides have been intimately linked for centuries .
 The argument that Ukraine constitutes a U.S. asset in the event of Russian aggression against the West is wrong and illogical . The argument is not true, according to the author of the book .
 Trade was a mere $3. billion in both directions, compared with $48 billion in trade between Ukraine and Russia before the revolution of 2014 .
 U.S. direct private investment in Ukraine in 2019 was an insignificant $596 million . United States direct private investments in Ukraine were $600 million .
 In military terms, Ukraine contributes nothing to U.S. or NATO security, in military terms . Ukraine is not a member of the United States or NATO .
 Ukraine's defense spending was less than $9 billion in 2020, compared with Russia’s $61. billion defense budget that year .
 The argument that Ukraine constitutes a U.S. asset in the event of Russian aggression against the West is wrong and illogical. Therefore, the argument is wrong.
 The only serious threat of actual conflict with Russia is over the disputed territories in Ukraine .
 NATO is responsible for deterring and repelling any Russian attempt to dominate Europe . Second, it is NATO, of which Ukraine is not a member, that is responsible .
 The greatest U.S. interest in Ukraine is the prevention of a conflict there. By far, then, the greatest United States interest in the Ukraine is in prevention .
 Even a limited new war between Ukraine and Russia would distract the U.S. from much more important challenges elsewhere .
 If the U.S. were drawn into such a war, this would be a catastrophe for America, Russia, the world, and Ukraine itself .
 Biden administration policy toward Ukraine Present U.S. policy is to continue to support Ukraine rhetorically and give limited amounts of military and economic assistance, but not radically to increase that assistance .
 The Donbas is a frozen conflict that will remain an irritant in U.S. relations . This reduces the immediate risk of war but leaves the Donbas as a frozen war . This is one factor pushing Russia further toward an alliance with China .
 Kiev government has a permanent opportunity to stir up new crises for domestic political advantage and win more U.S. attention and assistance .
 The conflict over South Ossetia was frozen for 16 years . In 2008, Georgian government miscalculated that it had enough support from America to recover the region by force .
 The conflict over NagornoâKarabakh was more or less frozen for 25 years . Last year, Azerbaijan judged that it had enough military strength to reconquer the territory .
 The division of Kashmir between India and Pakistan has remained essentially unchanged since 1948 . There have been repeated outbreaks of fighting in the intervening 73 years .
 U.S. senators from both parties, retired officials, and commentators have repeatedly proposed an alternative strategy for Ukraine . The calls have grown greatly in response to the increased Russian pressure on Ukraine and NATO at the end of 2021 .
 No evidence indicates that such a strategy would change Moscow’s approach . However, no evidence indicates such an approach would change the city's approach .
 intensive sanctions have not changed Russia’s position in the slightest . So far, intensive sanctions haven't changed Russia's position in any way .
 The domestic prestige of the Putin administration rests heavily on Russian nationalism . To hand the Donbas back to Ukraine on Ukrainian terms would deal a severe blow to the domestic authority of this or any foreseeable Russian government .
 The U.S. would be faced with a dreadful choice between going to war with Russia and backing off and suffering severe international humiliation .
 It would suggest a U.S. commitment to fight for Ukraine in the event of war with Russia . It would also suggest, even if it did not formalize, a United States commitment .
 It could encourage disastrous miscalculation on the part of Kiev, leading to a crushing Russian victory . It could lead to a devastating Russian victory in Kiev .
 Biden administration should promote a peace settlement that will address the vital interests of Russia and Ukraine, he says .
 The way forward centers on restoring Ukrainian sovereignty over the Donbas with full autonomy for the region . International guarantees are sufficient to protect this autonomy .
 An international treaty should establish Ukraine's military neutrality while leaving open Ukraine's chance to carry out reforms . It could eventually allow it to join the West in economic, social, and cultural terms .
 The conflict over the Donbas began as a local revolt backed by armed Russian troops . The Donbas conflict began in the spring of 2014. The conflict began as an uprising against the Ukrainian nationalist revolution .
 Yanukovych was elected in 2010 with the support of an overwhelming majority of voters in the Donbas . That revolution involved the forcible overthrow in Kiev of President Viktor Yanukovych .
 The desire for regional autonomy dates back to the period of the Soviet collapse . It is rooted in the particular history, identity and tradition of the region .
 Donbas What is now known as the Donbas is situated around the middle reaches of the Donets River . The Donbas River is a tributary of theDonets River.
 It is part of the great Eurasian steppe that extends from the Danube to the borders of China . It is one of the greatest steppe regions in the world .
 The Donbas was thinly populated until the early modern period by a succession of nomadic peoples . The last being the Crimean Tatars .
 In the 18th century, the region was conquered by the Russian Empire . It was settled with a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian peasants, as well as German, Bulgarian, and Greek colonists .
 52. percent of the Russian imperial census of 1897 was listed as Ukrainian-speaking . 28. percent were listed as Russian-speaking.
 The modern history of the Donbas began in the mid-19th century, with the discovery of immense coal reserves in the area .
 The Donbas grew rapidly to become one of the chief coal-producing areas, first of the Russian Empire and then of the USSR . It attracted workers from Russia and other areas of the Soviet Union and Ukraine .
 In 1989, 45 percent of the population of the Donbas identified as ethnically Russian and 51 percent as Ukrainian . Most of this population gave Russian as their mother tongue . The last Soviet census was in 1989 .
 The extremely high levels of intermarriage between Russians, Ukrainians, and other ethnicities in the region made it difficult for local people to say what their â’s real ethnicity was .
 In common with other mining regions, the inhabitants of the Donbas also developed a strong sense of collective identity and solidarity .
 In 1989, together with miners in Russia, the coal miners of the Donbas conducted the first major economic strike in the USSR since the 1920s .
 The culture of the Donbas was therefore very different from that of Kiev, let alone the heartland of Ukrainian nationalism in western Ukraine .
 The legacy of Soviet identity remains strong in the Donbas . The identity of the region might best be described as “Russian-speaking Soviet’s”
 In March 1991, when the region held a referendum on whether to remain in a reformed and confederal Soviet Union, 83 percent of the local population voted to remain .20 A new referendum in the fall, following the coup in Moscow and the start of the final Soviet collapse, produced a
 A great many Ukrainians whom I asked said that they had voted for independence within the Soviet Union . However, a great many said they had vote for independence, a measure of the utter confusion in a public .
 Most people in Donbas expected to keep an open border with neighboring Russian regions . The Donbas are intimately linked by economic and family ties .
Independent Ukraine should be a federal state with extensive powers delegated to the regions, a congress of elected officials from southeast Ukraine met in 1991 .
Self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic mark 75th anniversary of liberation of Donbas region from Nazi occupation during World War Two .
90 percent of Ukrainians and 84 percent of the inhabitants of the Donbas voted for Ukrainian independence in December 1991 .
 The Donbas region is an international frontier between Ukraine and Russia . The region has been in the heart of Ukraine for more than two years .
 It is safe to conclude that support for local autonomy and for close ties with Russia has always been strong in the Donbas .
 An openly anti-Russian state devoted to an ethnic version of Ukrainian nationalism was bound to cause serious trouble in the Donbas . As a result, the emergence of an openlyAnti-Russian Ukrainian state was bound for serious trouble .
After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, nostalgia for the Soviet Union remained high in the Donbas . An economic decline that was much more severe than in Russia or Belarus.
 Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, huge majorities of voters in the Donbas voted consistently for pro-Russian parties and blocs .
 In 2000 poll, 61 percent of respondents in southeastern Ukraine described their primary identity as deriving from their region or locality . 39 percent described Ukraine as their main identity, according to poll .
 In 1994, 90 percent of voters in a local referendum wanted a federal system for Ukraine, official status in the region for the Russian language alongside Ukrainian . But these demands were refused by the Ukrainian government .
 Various groups advocating outright secession from Ukraine and union with Russia were active in the Donbas in the generation after the Soviet collapse . For decades, none of them gained majority support .
 Opinion polls in the region before the events of 2014 showed strong approval of federalism and opposition to separation from Ukraine .
Until then, Russian governments of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin did not endorse regional separatist movements . Until then, the Russian governments also didn't endorse separatist movements in Crimea .
 The nationalist revolution in 2014 resulted in the overthrow of a president who had won in the second round of the 2010 presidential elections . More than 80 percent of the vote in Lugansk and more than 90 percent in Donetsk were voted for .
 The Donbas revolt was first mass protests and then armed activists, including Russian citizens, seized local government offices in the Donbas . In response, Russian citizens seized government offices and declared regional sovereignty .
 regional referendum conducted on May 11, 2014 . This demand was backed by an overwhelming majority in a regional referendum .
 A majority of the people of the Donbas would accept guaranteed regional autonomy within Ukraine as a solution to the conflict . Only a minority wants to be ruled by a centralized state in Kiev .
Ukrainianization appears to have grown even stronger as a result of moves by the Ukrainian state since 2014 to reduce and restrict the use of the Russian language in administration and education . There has always been strong resistance in the region to compulsory âs
 Russian language in government, higher education and service industries are restricted . Russian language is denied status as an "indigenous language"
 Russian military officers equipped with limited amounts of artillery, armored vehicles, and antiaircraft missiles . Attempts by the Ukrainian armed forces to regain control of the region were blocked and then driven back .
 Most are assumed to be members of the Russian armed forces acting under orders from the Russian government . The Russian government had occupied and annexed the Crimean region of Ukraine .
 The Donbas conflict is a separatist war with heavy Russian involvement, and not simply a Ukrainian war . It should be clear from the level of discontent in the Donbas from 1991 to 2014 that the conflict is not just a Ukrainian conflict .
 On the Ukrainian side, ultranationalist volunteer militias, not regular army units, did much of the fighting .
 The Azov Battalion was later incorporated into the Ukrainian National Guard . The most famous of these has been the Azov battalion, later incorporating into the national guard .
 These militias have neo-Nazi connections and leave no uncertainty about their hatred of Russians . The militias have no doubt about their hate of Russians.
 Ukraine's program of extreme ethno-cultural nationalism has hardly strengthened Ukraine’s appeal among the population of the Donbas . Their program is aiming for the destruction of Russian language and culture.
 More than 1.1 million people have been forced to leave their homes in the Donbas region . Fighting continued until the international âs meeting under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE.
 The Russian government has demanded autonomy for the Donbas and constitutionally guaranteed language and cultural rights for Russians throughout Ukraine . Russian government demands autonomy for Donbas .
 Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People’s Republic have subsisted through trade with Russia and through direct Russian economic support . Since 2014, the internationally unrecognized Donetsk Peopleâs republic has subsisted on Russia .
 By mid-2020, Russia had issued almost 200,000 Russian passports to inhabitants of the Donbas . It apparently plans to extend them to all those who want them .
 The Russian military effectively guarantees the region against a Ukrainian attempt at reconquest . The Russian army effectively guarantees a region against the Ukrainian attempt to reconquest.
 Russia has on several occasions carried out military maneuvers and deployments on Russia's side of the international frontier . So far, Moscow has ignored calls from some of the leadership in Donetsk and Lugansk for annexation by Russia .
 The Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine was formed in June 2014 under the auspices of the OSCE . Its initial goal was to establish a ceasefire in the Donbas .
 The ceasefire provided for a ceasefire, the withdrawal and disarming of all armed groups in the Donbas . Security zones in Donbas and adjacent areas of Russia to be monitored by a permanent OSCE force .
 The agreement failed to bring an immediate end to the fighting . It was because of the complex military situation on the ground . The agreement was not enough to bring a end to fighting .
 instability gave both sides the hope of occupying more territory in advance of a ceasefire or even of winning outright .
 In January 2015, the ceasefire collapsed completely as the separatists launched an offensive aimed at capturing the Ukrainian-held town of Debaltsevo .
 The OSCE convened a summit in Minsk of the leaders of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine . The Minsk II Protocol was held in February 2015 . The summit was attended by leaders of Russia, France and Germany .
 The Minsk II Protocol was endorsed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council, including the United States . They reached the agreement commonly known as  “Minsk II.â43 The M Belarus II Protocol .
 All internationally unrecognized local armed groups to be disarmed under OSCE supervision . All foreign forces to be withdrawn under supervision of OSCE .
Restoration of control of the border with Russia was to begin simultaneously with OSCEâsupervised elections under this law and to be completed with an elected regional authority .
 The notes to the Minsk II Protocol also contained safeguards for permanent local autonomy and links to Russia .
 Moscow and the separatist leadership insist on these provisions as guarantees against any future attempt by the Ukrainian government to abolish local autonomy by force .
 Minsk II ceasefire took effect after the capture of Debaltsevo by the separatists on February 18, 2015 .
 Neither side has mounted any further full-scale offensives. intermittent exchanges of fire have taken place every year and claimed hundreds of casualties .
 Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Francois Hollande, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attended a Normandy Format Meeting to assess the progress made in the Minsk peace agreement .
 The Normandy Quartet Format on the situation in the East of Ukraine includes France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine .
Operation Overlord was held for the first time on June 6, 2014, in Chateau de Benouville castle, Normandy . It was held in celebration of the 70th anniversary of Operation Overlord .
 The larger settlement envisioned by Minsk II has not, however, come to pass . The settlement has not yet been reached .
 No political agreement has been reached, Ukrainian sovereignty has not been restored, and separatist forces have not disarmed . Russian âvolunteers have not withdrawn, and Russian  volunteering has not withdrawn .
Fighting on the ground or military deployments by Moscow or Kiev have threatened to spiral into a new, full-scale conflict . At intervals, as in MarchâApril 2021, fighting in Russia or Kiev has threatened to escalate .
 Ukrainian governments have insisted that Kiev take full control of the Donbas, including the frontier with Russia . All local forces are disarmed or withdrawn .
 Ukrainian parliament will pass law permanently changing the Ukrainian constitution to accommodate Donbas autonomy . This is to be done before local elections are held and before the parliament passes a law .
 The argument is that otherwise Moscow and its local allies would rig the elections . It's not clear if the election will be rigged, it's not the case .
 The Russian government and separatist leadership have argued that if the Kiev government is allowed to establish full control before local elections and before a change to the constitution, it will itself rig or cancel the elections and forget about autonomy .
 A majority of the Ukrainian parliament is opposed to changing the constitution . It is very likely that no constitutional reform would occur .
 Moscow would then be faced with an extremely difficult choice between a complete Ukrainian victory in the Donbas or openly invading the territory with the Russian army . Moscow would have to choose between suffering the humiliation of a complete Ukraine victory or a Russian army invasion .
 Ukrainian side has done so without criticism or repercussions from U.S. administrations . It is certain that up to now, it is the Ukrainian side that has done this without criticism .
 The Ukrainian parliament did pass a law on special status for Donetsk and Lugansk on March 17, 2015, but the law was provisional . It was not to come into effect until elections under Ukrainian law . No political agreement has been reached, Ukrainian sovereignty has not been restored, separatist forces have
 Ukraine made no commitment to revise the Ukrainian constitution as a whole to provide for decentralization and Russian-language rights . Ukraine has not made a commitment to reform the constitution .
 All powers over the police and courts were reserved to the central government in Kiev . There was no provision for the creation of local militia .
 The provisional law was immediately denounced by Ukrainian nationalist groups . Even so, the provisional law has been denounced by nationalists .
 The leader of the Ukrainian extreme nationalist Right Sector party and paramilitary force Dmytro Yarosh declared that his group would continue fighting to restore the full authority of the Ukraine state over the Donbas .
 separatist leaders in the Donbas made a new demand in 2015 that the regional government share responsibility with Kiev for controlling the international border with Russia . There have been moves by the present Ukrainian government to prosecute Petro Poroshenko for agreeing to Minsk II.
 Kiev government and parliament immediately rejected all of these demands . The Kiev government immediately rejected the demands .
 Since the ceasefire of February 2015, the Donbas conflict has remained semi-frozen . The current impasse has been described as an "impasse"
 The Ukrainian parliament has annually renewed the temporary law on special status for the Donbas . But it remains suspended and provisional .
 President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the Minsk II agreement to be revised by new negotiations . New negotiations would include the United States, Canada, and Britain .
 Ukraine is not bound to offer permanent autonomy to the Donbas, Poroshenko government says . His administration has followed the Poroshenko administration in declaring that Ukraine isn't in fact, bound to offers autonomy .
 U.S. representatives must enter into talks with clear, concrete, and detailed proposals for a settlement . The involvement of the United States is essential to the success and implementation of any agreement .
 Kiev would always be able to try to mobilize U.S. support against any settlement . Without it, Kiev would have even less incentive to make concessions .
 U.S. representatives must enter into talks with clear, concrete, and detailed proposals for a settlement . If the United States is to help bring about a settlement, it must be clear and concrete .
 A new U.S. approach to peace in Ukraine should begin with a public restatement by the Biden administration . The Obama administration endorsed the principles of Minsk II, as endorsed by the Obama administration .
 Ukraine can ever be brought back together again and Ukrainian stability, security, and unity guaranteed in the long term . It is only on this basis that Ukraine can never be brought together again .
 A statement would be the first step in creating the foundation of limited but sufficient mutual confidence among Washington, Moscow and Donbas separatists . If any settlement is to be achieved, it would be necessary if any settlement was achieved .
 The Biden administration should also encourage unofficial meetings between citizens of the Donbas and representatives of U.S., European, and Ukrainian civil society . The strategy to lay the basis for a settlement, the Biden administration says .
 These would serve as confidence-building measures and spread knowledge of the views and identity of the Donbas people among Western policymakers, analysts, and commentators . These would be used to help build confidence in the region .
 The Minsk II agreement failed to reach a peace settlement . It is also necessary to address the factors that brought about the failure of the Minsk agreement .
 Ukrainians are refusing to guarantee full autonomy for the Donbas region . The region has been in the midst of a crisis in recent years .
 Ukraine's Donbas region could use its constitutional position within Ukraine to block membership . The region has refused to retain centralized power in Kiev . The main reason for this refusal is the belief that permanent autonomy for the Donbas would act as a barrier to Ukraine joining NATO .
 The official United States commitment to eventual Ukrainian membership in the alliance has in turn inhibited the United States from playing a positive role in resolving the conflict . The official U.S. commitment to the alliance is empty in real terms, however.
 The threat of NATO membership for Ukraine has been a principal driver of Russian hostility towards Ukraine and the West . The U.S. endorsed the Minsk II agreement and has never officially disowned it . Since 2015 it has in practice done nothing to help create an actual settlement
 There has been no attempt whatsoever by any of the three U.S. administrations since 2015 to use America’s vast leverage with Ukraine to persuade governments in Kiev to change their approach to the Donbas .
 Ukraine will never be invited to join NATO and the E.U., nor should it be. So long as Ukraine is involved in a territorial conflict, it will never join NATO or E. U.U.
 Germany and France would certainly veto it. Even if a U.S. administration were prepared to take the risk of membership under these conditions, they would definitely veto it .
 There is no way to resolve this conflict on Ukrainian terms without victory in war against Russia, which is impossible . And as already stated, there are no ways to resolve the conflict on Ukraine terms .
 Minsk II’s basic terms are an end to the war and autonomy for the Donbas within Ukraine. Realistically speaking, they are the best deal that Ukraine is ever going to get.
 Ukraine will not join NATO, and recognizing this opens the way to a solution of the Donbas conflict based on an expanded version of the Minsk II agreement . The fact is that Ukraine will NOT join NATO.
 Supporters of Ukrainian membership in NATO often talk in terms of the need to create a Europe whole and free . But Europe will never be whole andFree if Russia is shut out of Europe, they say .
 No Russian government will accept being banished from Europe in this way . Large parts of the Ukrainian population, given their cultural affinities with Russia, will not accept hard frontier between themselves and Russia .
 Such a Europe would be bitterly divided and militarized, not whole and free . Such a European Europe would have been bitterly divided, not entire and free.
 Secretary of State Antony J Blinken meets with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in Kyiv on May 6, 2021 .
 If U.S. abandons the hopeless goal of NATO membership for Ukraine, it will put itself in a position to pressure the Ukrainian government and parliament into agreement . The United States could withdraw aid and political support from Ukraine .
 The Donbas and Crimean disputes should not only remain in place, but be greatly intensified . As to Russia, if Moscow were to reject or sabotage this new agreement, or permit the Donbas separatists to do so, all existing Western sanctions against Russia should be intensified .
 Kiev should grant independence to the Donbas as well as Crimea, U.S. should grant it to Donbas, says CNN's John Sutter .
 If reincorporated into Ukraine, voters would vote for parties opposed to membership . This action would, at a stroke, end territorial conflicts blocking membership and remove from Ukraine .
 Kiev and Washington have ruled out this possibility so often that it would seem to have become politically impossible for them to accept it . However, both Kiev and D.C. have ruled it out .
Opposition to separation of Donbas might eventually and quietly lapse . Still, if the present situation lasts indefinitely, then, then the situation might not .
 U.S. administrations have declared their support for Minsk II and voted for it in the Security Council . The United States was not a signatory to either the Minsk Protocol or Minsk 2 .
 The United States should seek to relaunch the Minsk process, this time participating fully, says Samantha Power . The U.S. should throw the full weight of American influence behind a settlement, she says .
 If a majority of voters in the Donbas were to oppose the constitutional amendment, they would be taken to have chosen to remain within Ukraine under its present unitary constitution .
 The constitutional amendment would then be submitted to the Ukrainian parliament . But in the likely event of approval in the referendum, the amendment would be submitted .
 If the parliament rejected it, a new, internationally supervised referendum would be held . It would give the people of the region a clear choice between rejoining a unitary Ukraine and becoming independent .
 To secure the establishment and maintenance of autonomy, the referendum on autonomy and the establishment of a regional government under the Ukrainian constitution must come before Ukraine takes control of the border with Russia . To secure autonomy, Ukraine must also take control of its border with the Russian border .
 Police and courts in the Donbas Autonomous Republic would come under the regional government . The region would be a regional government.
 Military security would be provided by a United Nations peacekeeping force drawn from neutral countries outside Europe . The Security Council resolution is in support of the peace settlement .
 U.S. and NATO forces would not be included in Russia, nor would Russian forces or those of countries allied to Russia .
 The peacekeeping force would supervise and certify the disarmament of the existing separatist armed forces . The withdrawal of all Russian forces and withdrawal of the Ukrainian armed forces from their present positions in Donetsk and Lugansk .
 A revived and updated Minsk settlement would have a real chance of succeeding . Federalism and its precedents would have the real chance.
 Gallup poll in December 2014 showed a plurality of Ukrainians, 43 percent, in favor of decentralizing power to the regions . Ukrainian government and parliament have rejected a federal system and resisted true autonomy for the Donbas .
 This poll took place without the participation of people in the separatist areas of the Donbas and Crimea .
With them, it would undoubtedly have shown a substantial majority in support of decentralization . With them, there would have been a significant majority of support for decentralization, says author .
 A federal constitution would seem the best political system for the country as a whole . A federal solution to regional discontent is also well in line with international and democratic practice .
 Russia has a federal constitution that grants genuinely extensive powers to autonomous republics such as Tatarstan . The constitution is heavily qualified when it comes to the conduct of elections .
 These Russian republics are based on the autonomous republics of the USSR and therefore form part of a constitutional tradition shared by Ukraine . They are based in the same way as the USSR .
 The United States, of course, has a federal system, as do Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, India, and South Africa .
 There can be no objection, on the basis of democratic principle, to a federal system for Ukraine, or to special autonomy for the Donbas .
Given the differences in language and culture among different parts of Ukraine, a federal constitution would seem the best political system for the country as a whole .
 Most people in the south and east of Ukraine seem to be desired by most people . As noted above, it also seems to be wanted by most of the country's people .
 Only certain regions enjoy special status, or one autonomous region exists in an otherwise unitary state, are accepted part of certain democracies .
 Asymmetric federations are well-established in democratic tradition and international solutions to conflicts, including solutions sponsored by the U.S. The United States.
 The peace agreement of 1998 brought an end to the Northern Ireland conflict . It is especially pertinent to a solution to the Donbas question .
 It took place with the support of the United States, reformed the regional police force . It placed it under regional control, established cross-border institutions, and guaranteed freedom of movement .
 This agreement has also been widely suggested as the only possible model for an eventual settlement of the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan . The Kashmir dispute has been in the Indian portion of that territory .
 A peace settlement would include a treaty establishing Ukrainian neutrality for the next generation . Ideally, a treaty would also establish Ukrainian neutrality .
 This would be modelled on the Austrian State Treaty and associated Austrian law on neutrality of 1955 but would be ended or renewed after 30 years . This would have been modeled on the Austria State Treaty .
 Such a treaty would help to gain Russia’s full support for a settlement and remove a pointless source of irritation in relations between Russia and the West and between Moscow and Kiev .
 It would remove the greatest motive by far for Russian interference in and intimidation of Ukraine . It would also remove the great motive for Russia's interference in Ukraine .
 Ukraine and the U.S. would sacrifice nothing by such a treaty, since it is impossible for Ukraine to join NATO so long as the Donbas conflict and Crimean dispute remain open .
 The treaty would be a barrier against any future Russian attempt to dominate Ukraine . It would also rule out Ukrainian membership in any Russian-dominated alliance .
 The treaty would prevent Russia from repeating its bid to draw Ukraine into the Eurasian Union . This treaty would also prevent the Russia from re-engaging Ukraine in the Union .
 Ukrainian membership is essential to any hope of making the Eurasian Union into a serious international bloc . Ukraine is one of the most important countries in the world .
Ukrainian membership in NATO and E.U. would drastically weaken them . By contrast, Ukrainian membership in the E. U.S. would in fact significantly weaken them.
Ukrainian neutrality would disadvantage Russia more than the West. On balance, Ukraine would disadvantage the West more than Russia, according to experts .
 Ukraine's membership in NATO and the E.U. would drastically weaken them . This would be an important disincentive for Russia to support such an agreement .
 The West would sacrifice nothing by dropping all thought of Ukrainian membership in NATO and the E.U. for the next generation . In practice, the West would do the same with regard to the Eurasian Union .
 The uprising of 2013â14 in Kiev made clear that any attempt to take Ukraine into such an alliance would provoke such bitter opposition among many Ukrainians that alliance with Russia could not be implemented .
 Ukraine's corruption, political dysfunction, and lack of economic progress effectively rule this out for at least a generation. As for Ukrainian membership in the E.U., Ukraine’s corruption and political dysfunction is a problem .
 The deep internal problems of the E.U. also make Ukrainian membership in the near to medium term quite implausible .
 E.U. promises to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2055, a pledge that would leave little money for the huge task of subsidizing the Ukrainian economy .
 U.S. economic development aid to Ukraine, at $285 million a year in 2020, does not begin to meet the nation’s needs . Let alone help it prepare for E.U. membership, let alone.
 The miserable records of corruption in the new E.U. member states of Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia also make it exceptionally unlikely that the U.S. would seek a huge and impoverished new eastern member for many years to come .
 Ukrainian politicians might wish to study neutral Finland, Sweden, and Austria during the Cold War .
 These states lost nothing by remaining neutral and, indeed, developed as prosperous, lawful democratic Western societies . They were able to join the E.U. after the Cold War ended .
 E.U. and NATO accession process could develop in this way not through an E. U.S. or NATO process, but rather because elites and populations of these countries were genuinely committed to democracy, the rule of law, and regulated market economics .
 Russia has formally annexed Crimea after officially recognizing the 2014 referendum on this question . There is no chance it will return the territory to Ukraine .
President Putin's departure from the scene will not change the outcome of his presidency, says Peter Bergen . Bergen: The political order Putin created would collapse if he left the scene .
 It is the immense strategic and emotional importance of Crimea to Russia . It is what appear to be the wishes of a majority of its inhabitants, that make a reversal impossible .
 Any Russian government that surrendered Crimea would suffer a catastrophic loss of domestic prestige . Russian government would lose domestic prestige if it surrendered Crimea .
 If Ukraine took advantage of some future Russian domestic crisis to try to recover the peninsula by force, then local Russian forces would fight . Moscow would be compelled to support them at any cost .
 To think otherwise is to misunderstand the power of nationalism in Russia, says Russian journalist .
 The only imaginable circumstances in which a transfer of Crimea back to Ukraine could occur would be if Ukraine entered into a close economic and security alliance with Russia . The terms on which Khrushchev transferred Crimea from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 would be akin to the terms of the
 Crimean city of Sevastopol is home to Russia’s only major naval base on the Black Sea . The Crimean city is also home to Russian naval base in Crimea .
 It is key to the defense of southern Russia, to Russian influence and power projection in the southern Caucasus and the Mediterranean . It is also key to guarding against the possibility of future Turkish aggression .
 It is as likely that Russia will abandon Sevastopol as that the U.S. would give up Pearl Harbor .
 Previous U.S. administrations should have considered this reality before they adopted a plan for Ukrainian membership in NATO that implied the eventual Russian expulsion .
 Sevastopol also possesses outsize importance in Russian national memory . Sevastopoulos also possess outsize significance in Russian memory .
 It was the scene of two famous sieges by the British, French, and Turks in 1854â55 and by the Germans and Romanians in 1941 .
 defenders of Sevastopol held out against overwhelming odds for eight months, delaying the entire German offensive in the south . During the Second World War, the defenders of the Sevastopoulos held out.
 In 1944, 500,000 to 600,000 Soviet soldiers lost their lives in Crimea . In that siege, the Soviet offensive to relieve the city, and the reconquest of Crimea in 1944, was successful .
 A Russian government that tried to abandon Sevastopol would sign its own political death warrant . Leningrad and Stalingrad are one of the greatest military epics in Russian history .
 For the U.S. to base its policy on a belief that Russia can be compelled to return Crimea is pointless, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: For the United States to base policy on its policy is pointless .
 That is never going to happen, short of Russian defeat in a war with the U.S. That is not going to occur, says CNN's John Sutter .
 U.S. option is to shelve the Crimean issue, in the realistic expectation that over a long period of time the world will quietly forget the issue and accept the status quo .
 Few today remember that the U.S. has never formally recognized the Indian annexation of most of Kashmir .
 The United States and India never discuss and that the United States never raises internationally . It is simply a question that the U.S. and IndiaNever discuss, says India .
 The problems with this approach are two, however, are two . That is never going to happen, short of Russian defeat in a war with the U.S.
 First, it either leaves Western sanctions in place or requires a congressional sleight of hand to lift them as part of a political settlement of the conflict .
 If sanctions remain, they will be a permanent and critical barrier to the improvement of relations with Russia . Russia's relationship with the U.S. has been strained for years .
 The Ukrainian government will continue to put pressure on Crimea. Equally important, if the issue remains unresolved, the Ukrainian government is tempted to put Pressure on the region .
 By 2021, the cutoff of water supplies by Kiev had already led to a severe agricultural crisis on the peninsula .
 Such action creates an obvious risk of Russian retaliation that could lead to a new crisis or even a war . Such action could be the first time Russian retaliation has been seen in recent years .
 Failing to resolve Crimea’s status risks eliminating U.S. geopolitical gains from settling the Donbas conflict . Failing in Crimea risks eliminating United States geopolitical gains.
 A new referendum on union with Russia should be held under the supervision of the OSCE and the U.N. If polls indicate, a majority voted to join Russia, then the Security Council should ratify this decision .
 The West should demand from Russia recognition of the independence of Kosovo from Serbia, leading to the recognition of that state by the United Nations . The U.N. should also seek Russia's recognition of Kosovo's independence .
 Russia has refused to recognise the independence of Kosovo from Serbia . Kosovo was the result of NATO’s military intervention in 1999 .
 Agreement on recognition of Kosovo independence would have to include a referendum on the separation of Serbian-populated Mitrovica from Kosovo and its incorporation into Serbia .
 This would simply bring diplomatic practice into line with reality . It's always a good idea whenever possible, says the author .
 There can be no Ukrainian recovery of Crimea and the Donbas without war, and no Serbian recovery of Kosovo without war . No Kosovar incorporation of Mitrovica without a new war with Serbia .
 The avoidance of new wars in Europe should be at the heart of the U.S. strategy toward the continent, says the author .
 The United States simply cannot afford them. Apart from moral and humanitarian issues involved, the U.S. simply can't afford them, says CNN's Tom Charity .
 The benefits of a Donbas settlement would increase the possibility of progress on wider issues in the bilateral relationship . Each party has strong incentives to agree to a Ukrainian settlement along the lines .
 U.S. and E.U. chief incentive is to eliminate the possibility of a new war in Ukraine . The U.N. says it is trying to end a new conflict in Ukraine.
 Such a war can end only in Ukraine's defeat and American and European humiliation, says CNN's John Sutter .
 Even the possibility of war with Russia massively diverts U.S. resources from East Asia and urgent domestic priorities .
 A new war between Russia and Ukraine would probably lead to a major redeployment of U.S. forces to Europe . This at a time when the United States can least afford it.
 Russia is driving Russia into closer cooperation with China, says U.S. President Barack Obama . Russia's relations with the United States is rooted above all in the Ukraine disputes .
 Russian-Chinese collaboration has recently extended to military technology, geopolitical agendas, space exploration, energy supplies, and the development of China's Belt and Road projects .
 By reducing tensions with Russia through a Ukrainian settlement, the United States would increase the possibility of progress on wider issues in the bilateral relationship .
 Resolving Ukraine could help to bring about nuclear arms reductions, the U.S. military withdrawal of the United States .
 Ukraine settlement would help to discourage Russia from forming closer partnership with China . It would be highly damaging to Western hopes of counterbalancing Chinese power .
 Growing dependence on China brings considerable dangers for Russia, too, says Russian commentators . The prospect of complete subordination could lead to the loss of Russian influence in Central Asia and perhaps the Middle East .
 Putin is using close relations with China to strengthen Russian resistance to U.S. pressure, not to put Russia in China’s pocket, he says .
 The recovery of geopolitical and economic room to maneuver would be one of the great advantages of a Ukrainian settlement . For Russia, then, the recovery of economic and geopolitical room would be a great advantage .
 Putin administration would nonetheless present this to the Russian public as a great international triumph . The suspension for a generation of Ukrainian hopes of joining NATO and the E.U. in practice gives Russia nothing that it does not already have .
 Russia would have to take responsibility for compelling the separatist leaders in the Donbas to accept reincorporation into Ukraine .
 Russia has accepted both of the Minsk agreements and is in a position to force the separatist leadership to implement a settlement based on Minsk II if the Ukrainian side does the same . The Ukrainian side has also agreed to a settlement with Russia .
 For Ukraine, a peace settlement would eliminate the possibility of a war with Russia that could lead to Ukraine's defeat . The advantage of a Ukrainian settlement for Russia would be the lifting of Western economic sanctions .
 A solution to the Donbas conflict would lead to the sanctions being imposed in response to Russia’s intervention there being lifted . That in turn would contribute greatly to a solution of the Crimea issue and the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Russia for the annexation of Crimea .
 Russian economy has not imposed disastrous losses on the Russian economy, but their impact has still contributed to growing public unrest in Russia . The impact has been considerable, but it has also contributed to public unrest.
 A new clash between Russia and Ukraine will lead to the imposition of severe U.S. and European sanctions . The Donbas conflict remains unsettled .
 The danger for Russia is likely to increase in the years to come as the E.U. seeks to reduce its fossil fuel consumption and imports to meet emissions goals .
 Russia is going to need all the European sympathy it can get. In the new world of energy production in the midâ21st century, Russia will need all its European sympathy .
 The separatists would naturally be unhappy with an outcome that did not achieve full separation of their regions from Ukraine . The separatists are unhappy with the outcome.
 Russia has almost complete dependence on Russia for support . But it could not successfully oppose Moscow’s acceptance of such a settlement, says author .
 A settlement would also include the possibility of the Donbas becoming independent and joining Russia if the Ukrainian government or parliament rejected the agreement .
 A peace settlement would eliminate the possibility of a war with Russia that could lead to Ukraine’s defeat and the loss of much greater areas of eastern and southern Ukraine .
 Ukraine would join the West in real terms, rather than a symbolic gesture . It would guarantee a generation of peace and stability, in which Ukraine could pursue, with Western aid .
 Kiev to accept Crimea settlement would be the most difficult provision of a settlement for Kiev . It would also be the abandonment of its claims on Crimea following a second referendum there .
 recognition of Kosovo independence would cause bitter complaints from Serbia and Russia . Recognition of Crimean union with Russia could cause bitter protests from Ukraine and the United States .
 Crimea, whose population has never been majority Ukrainian, is certainly not a historic part of Ukraine . Crimea's population has not been majority Ukraine .
 A Crimea within Ukraine would obstruct Ukraine’s hopes to join the West and develop a Ukrainian national culture .
 The separation of the Donbas and Crimea removed more than 15 percent of the Ukrainian electorate . The overwhelming majority had always voted for proâRussian parties and against Ukrainianization .
 Ukraine could get Crimea and the Donbas back, it would not know what on earth to do with them . Simply put, if Ukraine could return to Ukraine, it wouldn't know what they would do .
Ukrainian ethnic nationalists should be actively celebrating their loss. Ukrainian ethnic nationalists must celebrate their loss .
 Faced with the reality of this loss, perhaps some may eventually learn to move on . The loss of the U.S. House of Representatives in New York City is a big loss .
 In any case, U.S. and European policymakers should give no special deference to the views of Ukrainian ethnic nationalists .
 The Donbas and Crimea are being reincorporated into Ukraine . Their existing program demands simultaneously the unconditional reincorporatedation of the Donbas into Ukraine.
 This program is politically impossible, morally unacceptable, and contrary to basic democratic principles . This program was politically impossible and morally unacceptable . It's politically impossible. This program's program is morally unacceptable. It's not democracy .
 It is a recipe not for integration into the West but for ethnic dictatorship and future civil war . It is not a recipe for integration in the West, it is for an ethnic dictatorship .
 Ukraine’s stability, liberal democracy, and hopes of one day joining the E.U. all depend on radically curtailing the ethno-nationalist influence now evident in Kiev and western regions of the country .
 Recent developments in Hungary and Poland should offer a lesson to the West as to the folly of making commitments to other countries before ensuring they are in fact committed to democratic values .
 The frozen war with Russia over these territories is a major driver of authoritarian and chauvinist tendencies in Ukraine . Ukraine's conflict with Russia is a key factor in the country's authoritarian tendencies .
 Increasing division along consciously ethnic lines has been one of the most tragic results of the conflict with Russia and the rise of Ukrainian ethnic nationalism .
 Ukrainian territorial conflicts make Ukrainian membership in NATO impossible . Ukrainian ethnic chauvinism and authoritarianism would make it impossible for Ukraine to join the European Union .
 Recent developments in Hungary and Poland should offer a lesson to the West as to the folly of making commitments to other countries before ensuring that they are committed to democratic values .
 The Minsk II accord was endorsed by the United States, leading European countries, Russia, the United Nations Security Council, and Ukraine . The accord was signed by the U.S. and Russia .
 A Ukrainian constitutional amendment on autonomy for the Donbas has been passed . The international community has been lacking in the international community's willingness to insist on its implementation .
 As to Crimea, the U.S. and its Western allies have stuck to a total, unqualified demand for a return of that territory to Ukraine . The demand stands no chance of being fulfilled, rather than seeking a reasonable quid pro quo over Russiaâ�
 Opposition to a reasonable compromise on the Ukraine question also stems in part from a fear that Russian strategy in Ukraine is a key part of much wider Russian ambitions .
 This attitude shows a serious lack of historical knowledge, international perspective, and intellectual balance . This attitude is shown by the author of the book, "The World History of the World"
 Pakistani claim to Kashmir is the prelude to a Pakistani invasion of Myanmar, and the Argentinian invasion of the Falklands was part of a plan to invade Brazil . By this standard, the Pakistani claims to Kashmir are a standard .
 For the ethnic, historical, strategic, and political reasons set out in this paper, the Donbas, Crimea, and Ukraine’s international alignments are vital issues for Russia in themselves, not paths to somewhere else .
 The proposals will meet with strong opposition from Ukrainian nationalists and their supporters in the U.S. Congress .
 Minsk II Protocol is an alternative to a settlement based on the Minsk Protocol . Such opponents have a duty to say what they themselves are proposing as an alternative .
 The only basis for a settlement is that of the Minsk II Protocol . The answer to all these questions is no, so the answer is no .
 At present, the U.S. approach to Ukraine and its conflicts has become a sort of zombie policy . The policy is wandering around pretending to be alive, and getting in everyone’s way .
 With the new threat of war looming over us, it is essential that they now do so, says the author .
For U.S. policymakers to block Ukrainian settlement out of wider hostility to Russia would be a failure of logic as well as of statesmanship and moral courage, writes Peter Bergen . Other issues between the United States and Russia should be addressed on their individual merits,
 The future of Afghanistan and the fight against Islamist terrorism is possible. In some areas, cooperation is possible, says the author .
 In others, such as interference in the U.S. electoral process, Russia must be firmly resisted . Russia must also be resisted.
 Russia will be pushed ever further toward alliance with China, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: No progress will be made on anything, that U.S. attention will be dispersed and wasted .
 The United States took a wiser approach toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War . The Soviet Union was a vastly greater threat to U.S. interests than Russia is today .
For U.S. policymakers to block a Ukrainian settlement out of wider hostility to Russia would be a failure of logic as well as of statesmanship and moral courage, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen says this hostility will be reduced by an end to the Ukrainian crisis .
 If reasonably cooperative relations between the West and Russia are to be restored, Russian behavior is to be improved . This process must begin with a settlement in Ukraine, says Peter Bergen .
 Sending lethal weapons would backfire, says Simon Saradzhyan . "Arming Ukraine a Risky Escalation," he says .
 Carnegie Moscow Center, February 18, 2021, will open in Moscow, Russia . The current impasse and the way out is still unclear .
