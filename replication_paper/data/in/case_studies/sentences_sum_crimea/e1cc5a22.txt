 Ukrainian citizens are dying on both sides of the front line . The world community is trying to persuade Russia to implement Minsk agreements .
Ukrainian authorities insist on the introduction of the UN peacekeeping mission . At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities insist.
 The diplomat, expert on foreign policy and security of the Maidan of Foreign Affairs foundation Oleksandr Khara, told OstroV why peacekeepers could not put an end to the war in the Donbass and what mistakes of Ukrainian authorities would benefit Russia .
 The introduction of peacekeepers is a continuation of the conflict in a different way. You have repeatedly stated that the introduction of Peacekeepers is not a result of the war .
 Crimea and the war in the Donbass are inseparably linked, as they are part of the unprovoked, unjust and criminal Russian aggression against the ""brotherly" Ukraine .
 The Minsk agreements give a distorted impression that there is a civil war in the Donbass . If Kyiv makes any concessions autonomy, support for the ties between the East and the Russian Federation the conflict will be solved .
 The leadership of the so-called "republics" is non-objective both in legal and political terms . They are merely representatives of the interests of the occupier country, says the author .
 This is a proxy – someone who serves the interests of another state. This is called a proxy - someone who is serving the interest of a state . The proxy is a person who serves a state's interests of other states .
Negotiations with them do not make sense, because they don't make any independent decisions . Therefore, negotiations with them are not making sense .
 The main goal of the Russian Federation is not to protect the Russian-speaking population, but to establish control over the whole of Ukraine . The Russian Federation wants to control the entire of Ukraine, not protect the population .
 Moscow puppets could have the right to veto foreign and internal state policy . The Constitution could be changed to allow them to make such changes to the Constitution .
 Ukraine will find itself in a constant internal conflict. This is unacceptable, because Ukraine willfind itself in an internal conflict, says the writer .
 The issue of Crimea has always served as a lever of pressure from the Russian Federation on Ukraine's policy . For example, before the occupation, the issue has always been a lever for pressure from Russia .
 Moscow repeatedly stressed that this is "primordial" Russian land, financed the local ""fifth column" which in turn served as a threat to Kyiv . Moscow stressed that the land is a "threat to Kyv"
 Russia has always claimed Crimea, despite international law and bilateral agreements . Russia has also claimed Crimea. Russia has never claimed Crimea .
 In 2014, Russia just annexed it, taking advantage of the situation in Ukraine . Russia just took advantage of Ukraine's situation.
 Putin decided not to follow the scenario of Transnistria, which is a de facto occupied territory, but without the desire to convert it into a de jure affiliation . The same as with the Donbass? Yes, after all, we only recently recognized part of
 If Russia used the same method with respect to the Crimea, the reaction of the West would be softer . If Russia uses the same way, the West's reaction would be softened .
 The European borders were changed by force for the first time in the postwar history . 10,000 people died in the Donbass in the early 1950s .
 Rules cannot be violated, because then the entire system of continental security will collapse . And rules can't be violated.
 Minsk agreements do not reflect the real causes of the war and cannot lead to its cessation . The Minsk agreement does not reflect real causes.
Peacekeepers are an attempt to end the war, and for Russia it is an instrument for its continuation by other methods . For us, peacekeepers are a attempt to ending the war. For Russia, peacekeeping is an effort to end its war, for us, for
 The Russian Federation is a permanent member of the UN Security Council . It is impossible to determine the mandate of peacekeepers, the composition of forces and assets .
 The mission can be used to block unprofitable for Moscow decisions . It will also affect the functioning of the mission, which can also be used.
 Russia already blocks the work of the UN special commission to investigate the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian army against civilians .
 Ukraine's capabilities in the UN are very limited, our term as a non-permanent member in the Security Council has already ended . In addition, Ukraine's ability to join the UN is very limited .
 peacekeepers should be deployed in the entire occupied territory, including the Ukrainian-Russian border, says CNN .
 If there is no supply of equipment and manpower from the Russian Federation, then the war will end . The Russian Federation will be exhausted, and accordingly, the conflict will end.
 Russia does not need this, since it is beneficial for it to smolder the conflict to achieve its strategic goals . But, Russia doesn't need this as it does to achieve strategic goals, it says .
 Last year alone there were about 2,000 cases of restricting the access of the OSCE SMM to the area of ​​the line of demarcation .
 The OSCE SMM cannot now fully perform its function, as the officers are not allowed to work . The officers are constantly threatened by the OSCE and are not able to work.
 UN peacekeepers will not solve this problem, because they can only use weapons in case of a threat to their security . UN peacekeeper will not be able to solve the problem, says the UN .
 One of the key conditions for the introduction of peacekeepers is a complete ceasefire . A complete ceasefire is needed for peacekeepers to be introduced .
 Russia is trying to relieve itself of responsibility, says Peter Bergen . Bergen: Russia's puppets are unacceptable from both political and legal points of view . He says it's trying to drag us into dialogue with its puppets .
 They do not express the interests of the population in the occupied territories . They were not democratically elected, their decisions are insignificant from the legal point of view .
 Minsk will not only agree to the narrative of a ""civil war, but we will deform the legal field, open the possibility of limiting our sovereignty, and create prerequisites for a real civil confrontation . By enshrining Minsk or the requirements of the “republics�
 The war can end without the peacekeepers within 24 hours if Putin gives instructions to the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation . He cannot give such an order because Putin's personality cult is propagandized there .
 At he is positioned as someone who ""always wins" that means he cannot lose this war . At he's positioned as a person who "always wins," that means that he can't lose it .
 He will insist Ukraine capitulate and fall into the zone of influence of the Russian Federation . But he will insist that Ukraine capitulates and falls into the Russian federation .
 Stalin offered the Chancellor of Germany Konrad Adenauer an alliance with the GDR . The GDR was under USSR control, which was under Soviet control .
 If we refuse to join NATO and European integration, then after a while the country will be in a socialist camp, that is, in the sphere of Moscow's control. And if we now refuse to joining NATO and Europe, that will be a problem .
 In order to return East Germany, it was necessary to become a strong country economically and militarily . East Germany is now a strong nation economically and economically .
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the GDR could not exist on its own, because it was an artificial formation . Then western Germany absorbed this territory, although the consequences are still visible .
 If we get back those Donbass territories in the same state as they are now, even without the conditions put forward by Russia, there will be preconditions for civil confrontation .
 The inevitable conversion of Rinat Akhmetov's considerable economic and organizational potential will mean the preservation of the pre-war problems of Donbass, says the author .
 It is impossible to hold elections immediately after the liberation of the country . This is another catastrophe waiting to happen. What about the local elections? It is not possible .
 A minimum of 3-5 years must pass after the end of the armed confrontation and the withdrawal of troops . The end of armed confrontation must be followed by the withdraws of troops.
 Only then it would be expedient to hold the first elections of local self-government, but not earlier . The first elections would be held in the first year of local government .
 The choice of the population must be conscious to prevent a new confrontation and the resumption of hostilities . The choice is to avoid a new conflict, says the author of the book .
After four years of propaganda, terror and the shooting. After all, it is necessary to carry out a set of measures for the rehabilitation of civil consciousness .
 Minsk is a twisted reality imposed on us and the West by Russia by Russia. This can be facilitated by the return of Ukrainian journalism, civil activists and human rights organizations .
 Ukrainian government must take those steps that correspond to reality, the government says .
 The ambiguous "law on reintegration" of the Donbass has a positive side . It is recognition of the status of the occupied territories and the aggressor country .
 If we are at war with Russia, it is necessary to break off diplomatic relations with Russia . Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and actually occupied part of the Donbass .
 This is not possible in the Security Council, but it still should be attempted several times in order to show the world that Russia is blocking this process . Russia is blocked this process.
 It is still possible to formalize such status with resolution of the UN General Assembly . Crimea annexation in 2014 was the first resolution to formally formalize the status of Crimea .
 It is necessary to recognize the aggressor country globally, so that those who are at war in the Donbass are not called separatists, insurgents or terrorists .
 They are proxy formations, that is, puppets of the Russian occupation regime . They are proxies of Russian occupation. They are puppet formations, they are puppets.
 The Russian Federation has been involved in a series of armed aggression in recent years . Russia has been accused of a number of terrorist acts .
 The point is to show the whole world that Russia has unleashed this conflict and to document it legally and politically, says CNN's John Sutter .
 There will be no more artificial demands for protection of Russians and Russian-speaking people . It will be difficult for an aggressor to impose on Ukraine various recipes in the form of federalization.
 The Kremlin goes on the offensive where it sees weakness from military and political point of view . Thirdly, the Kremlin sees weakness both from the military and the political side of view.
Russia's security and defense sector is undergoing reforms, says Russian journalist . Russia's security sector will be transformed, he says . Russia will be able to reduce the space for Russian subversive activity, he adds .
 Germany must change inside and integrate into Western structures outwardly, says German writer . "We will not only reduce the vulnerability now, but also create favorable prerequisites for the return of all territories," he says .
 Sanctions actually wreak considerable havoc on Russia, no matter how much the Kremlin flaunts . How much can this be affected by strengthening of sanctions against Russia?
 The net outflow of capital for four years of sanctions amounted to $258 billion, according to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation .
 Direct foreign investment fell seven times and amounted to $10 billion a year . At the same time, direct foreign investmentfell seven times .
 Only on the day of publication of the so-called Kremlin list by the Americans, Putin's oligarchs lost $1.1 billion .
 The safety net in the form of petrodollars allows Russia to maintain the conflict in the Donbass for some time .
 European "friends of Putin" are constantly trying to raise the issue of encouraging Moscow to implement the Minsk agreements . In addition, European "Friends of Putin"" are also trying to encourage Moscow to take action .
 Others are trying to manipulate, saying what for to support a corrupt Ukraine and lose from anti-Russian sanctions . Kyiv has promised to fight against corruption, as if sanctions were imposed not for Russia's aggression .
 It can swing the situation in Ukraine using other methods – propaganda, active measures, loosening of the political situation, diversions, terrorist attacks on the peaceful part of Ukraine, energy blackmail, cyberattacks .
 If this is not enough, it is necessary to maintain a simmering conflict, the Russians have a large toolkit . The Russian government is trying to keep the conflict simmering .
 The Russian Federation uses the local population in Donbass only as meat .
 Russia is trying to hide the number of dead Russians in every possible way . For example, Russia is attempting to hide its own dead Russians .
 There is the greatness of the state in Putin's thinking, no matter how many people will die, he says . "Because there is the great greatness of Russia," he adds .
 The only country that received dividends from the war in the Donbass and the occupation is Lukashenko's Belarus . It is an indicator of system that deceives not only the whole world, but also its own citizens .
 The Russian Federation was isolated on the part of the West and pressured on the parts of the Russian Federation . Before that, it was isolated in the West.
 Ukraine in the person of our president decided to play with Belarus in such a way as to exclude a possible attack from the Belarusian party . Ukraine's president played with Belarus to exclude any possible attack.
 Belarus has no point in attacking Ukraine on its own and will not allow Putin to do it . It is believed that it is possible to deal with Belarus, since it has not attacked Ukraine .
 The holding of negotiations in Minsk is a great diplomatic victory for Lukashenko . The hold of negotiations is a good diplomatic win for the Ukrainian leader .
 The cessation of direct flight connection with Russia is economically useful for Belarus . Belarus is the only country to have direct flights with Russia .
 The occupied Donbas has quite large share of Belarusian products . The increase in goods turnover can be noted as well – the goods from Western countries are transferred through Belarus to Russia .
 There is no possibility for the implementation of other producers, except for Russian and Belarusian .
 I would not blame Lukashenko that he benefits from numerous victims in the Donbass . I would also not blame him for the deaths of many people in the region .
 Minsk became a negotiation platform. He took advantage of the situation, and became a negotiating platform .
 It was necessary to look for a more neutral country, for example, Switzerland . It was needed to be more neutral, for instance .
 Belarus is no less dangerous for the Ukrainians than the Russian Federation, says the Ukrainian government .
 Our citizens hotheadedly believe that if I am not engaged in politics then I am safe . I'm safe, our citizens believe, if I'm not engaged to politics, then I will be safe .
 Russian special services are directed against anyone who can be convenient for them, regardless of political views .
 The main point is the continuation of trade with the Russian Federation and occupied territories as a consequence of the fact that diplomatic relations have not been broken off . If you are a citizen of Ukraine you are already at risk in Belarus. If you're a citizen in Ukraine you
 It is difficult to imagine how any other state does not break diplomatic relations with a country that has occupied part of its territory .
 The conflict will last for the unknown period of time, as it is one of Russia's tools for imposing its political will . The Ukrainian government gives wrong signals to the West and allows Russian propagandists to mock at themselves .
 The Kremlin has not achieved its goal, but the war will continue in one form or another, it has said .
 Only if Russia has serious internal problems, then the resources for conducting military operations in the Donbass will be exhausted . It will be possible to integrate the eastern region and the Crimea on the terms acceptable to Ukraine . And how will the current situation affect future election in Ukraine? Negative for sure
 Since Poroshenko did not fulfill his promise to end the war, people would remember it . Poroshenko could not do this, although he objectively could not.
 A pre-election campaign will be difficult for Petro Poroshenko . It will be necessary to make efforts to mobilize the Ukrainian community .
 It is possible that some event that will change the situation may occur . It is also possible that there may be a change in the situation .
 Many countries support Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, but due to the reforms' slowdown, the level of credibility in our country is declining .
 Ukraine is losing the credit of trust of the West. Ukraine is not the first time, and this is not for first time .
 The reason is not only in the reforms, but also in the fight against corruption . The reasons behind the reforms are not only the reforms but also the fight for corruption .
 corruption is a symptom of illness, and Ukraine's political system is a deformed political system . Ukraine's disease is a sign of illness.
 Because the system that does not have "checks and balances" is a favorable environment for corruption, it is favorable for corruption . The system that doesn't have checks and balances is a good environment for Corruption .
 Ukraine's president is the president of Ukraine . Ukraine is the country's first elected president . Ukraine's government has been accused of corruption in recent years .
 It is this position that helps to support corruption, so to say, fighting fit . It is a position that help to support Corruption, so say, fight fit .
 In order to change the situation, it is necessary to hang the "Damocles' sword" over the president's chair . The president has been accused of corruption in the past .
 It also requires amendments to the legislation allowing the anti-corruption authorities to investigate into the activities of the incumbent head of state .
Until there are no such mechanisms with respect to the president, we will not get rid of political corruption . Until there is no such mechanism, we won't get rid.
 The EU and the USA want to see Ukraine capable of governing itself . Ukraine becomes a factor of stability, including the ability to protect itself from an external aggressor .
