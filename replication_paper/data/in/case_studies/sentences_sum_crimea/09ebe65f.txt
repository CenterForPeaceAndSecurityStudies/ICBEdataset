 The annexation of Crimea in March 2014 took the world by surprise . A Reassessment of Russian Foreign Policy in Historical and Current Context.
 Europe had by no means been entirely peaceful since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . One European country’s seizure of the sovereign territory of another stunned most American and European observers .
 Moscow's support for a separatist movement in East Ukraine has been no less shocking . Western leaders continue to debate what Russia's goals are, what is behind them, and what should be done to mitigate the dangers of further violence in Europe .
 Russia’s general attitude toward Ukraine is largely consistent with historical Russian thinking about security interests and foreign policy . We conclude that Russia's general attitudes toward Ukraine are consistent with historic Russian thinking .
Historical patterns of Russian foreign policy are an important starting point for understanding what has happened in the last year . But they are insufficient by themselves to fully explain Russian actions .
 Russia's behavior has been marked by unnecessary actions that have limited, rather than enhanced, its ability to attain those goals . Russia’s behavior, while carried out in pursuit of goals that are well-aligned with its historical interests, has been marked by unnecessary action
 We explain this deviation by arguing that Russian foreign policy today is also influenced by other factors . We also argue that Russia's foreign policy is also influencing other factors.
 Putin’s unchallenged policymaking role and his personal viewpoint regarding recent events in Ukraine. Most important of these are Putin's personal viewpoint on Ukraine, and the implications of both for his country .
 Public reporting burden for collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response . The time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed .
 This Perspective provides an overview and analysis of sources of Russian foreign policy to help explain Russia's actions in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015 .
 It evaluates arguments based on Russian strategic interests, economic policy, and domestic policy to determine which explanations, alone or in combination, stand up best to Russia’s actual choices .
 The authors conclude that Russia’s general attitude toward Ukraine is largely consistent with historical Russian thinking about security interests and foreign policy . The authors concluded that Russia's general attitude to Ukraine is mostly consistent with historic Russian thinking .
Historical patterns alone are insufficient to fully explain Russian actions . However, these historical patterns alone can be used to explain Russian action .
 Neither can public opinion, elite interests, or pursuit of economic growth be defined as key drivers of Russian behavior .
 Moscow has sought to shape, rather than respond to, public opinion, and has done so with great success . Moscow has tried to shape its own way of responding to public opinion .
 Decisionmaking in the Kremlin has become highly centralized, obviating the possibility of elite group influence . Decisionmaking has become more centralized.
Economic growth goals have been jettisoned, rather than pursued, in this crisis . Finally, economic growth goals are now being pursued, instead of pursued, by government .
 The authors argue that an important component of the Kremlin’s decision calculus also stems from how Russia's leaders have interpreted the Maidan uprising in Ukraine .
 Putin’s fear that popular opposition and unrest will threaten his power has led him to endanger many of the things he has worked to build over his tenure .
 Russia has by no means been consistently opposed to the rest of Europe . Russia's long, glorious, and sometimes tragic history as a European power has been one of vacillation between integration and rejection of it .
 It has been invaded on several occasions by rising European powers and repeatedly sought to protect itself by dominating the nations on its borders .
 Many Russian leaders have pointed to these patterns when they claim Russia’s historical right to dominate its periphery . But none more than Putin has pointed to this pattern .
 The territory ruled from the Russian capital has both grown and shrunk repeatedly . From conquest and retrenchment as Muscovy was built, to the Russian Empire’s expansion, the territory has also grown .
 Russia was a European great power since the time of Peter the Great, three centuries ago . Even as territory shifted, Russia was, without doubt, a great power .
 Russia was the main protagonist in the Crimean War and subsequent crises that arose from the collapsing Ottoman Empire in the later 19th century . Russia was a key figure in the Crimea War .
 Russia’s alliance with France in the 1890s is widely viewed as one of the first steps on the road to World War I . Russia's defense of Serbia in 1914 was a principal action in the rolling march toward war .
 Moscow ruled much of Europe through the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact for half of the 20th century . After that conflict was over, Moscow ruled the whole of Europe for half a century .
 The most obvious is its size, stretching across Europe and Asia . It's also stretching across the world .
 Russia has made it easier for Russia to vacillate between periods of engagement with Europe and periods of relative retreat . This geography has made the country's geography easier to Vacillate .
 Russia has been part of the European system, but has stood apart at times . Russia has also stood apart with other countries .
 The nation has many potential enemies, and has faced marauders and invaders . The U.S. has faced a number of possible enemies, including invaders .
 The border creates an inherent internal security, administrative, and governance challenge . The border also creates an internal security and administrative challenge .
 During the Cold War, Paul Kennedy argues, the Soviet Union claimed “absolute security along its extensive borders’s extensive borders, yet its . . unyielding policy toward its neighbor's own security concerns worsen its relations with western and eastern Europe .
 Russian Geography since 1914 The Russian Empire, 1914 The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact until 1989 Russia since 1991 until present Imperial expansion was Russia’s way of defending itself against invasion .
 The Russian appetite for imperial conquest was unique in the 19th century . This is not to say that the Russian appetite was unique .
 It was in line with the imperialist trends of the era, as well as the dominant practices of Realpolitik in Prussia, France, England, and elsewhere .
 If Russia did not enlarge its empire, other states would do so at its expense . If Russia didn't enlarge its empires, other countries would have done so .
Unlike other European states, Russia's was continental . Unlike other European nations, Russia was continental.
 Russia did not participate extensively in the carve-up of Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, or Asia . Instead, it expanded by incorporating neighboring territories .
 In later decades, Russian forces conquered the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia .
 The Red Army did not annex all the areas held by the Red Army at the time of victory . It did not, however, annex all of the areas.
Many Western scholars have argued that Russian expansionism was driven by insecurity . Many Western scholars argue that Russia is driven by security issues .
 Russia and the USSR tended to view the greatest threats as those on their periphery . Russia and Russia tended to see the greatest threat as those in the periphery .
 Unlike Germany or France, Imperial Russia never threatened to take over another major European power . Small states were at risk, although smaller states were also at risk .
 In the aftermath of World War II, it was Soviet incursions into Iran and divisions over the disposition of states in Eastern Europe that drove a wedge between Stalin and other members of the Grand Alliance .
 There were two substantial differences between pre-revolutionary Russian patterns of behavior and Soviet patterns . There were also substantial differences in pre-Revolutionary Russian behavior .
 Tsarist Russia had substantial interests in Asia, its fundamental security focus tended to be on Europe . But its fundamental focus was on Europe.
 The Soviet Union, by contrast, was active globally, with bases and relationships throughout the world, and military engagements far from its soil .
 Russia under the Tsars did not view its conflicts with other European great powers in existential terms . Second, both were insecure about their relationship with the West .
 Russian leaders saw conflict as being in the nature of the international system . Russian leaders, like most of their contemporaries, saw conflict in nature of international system.
Russia advanced its interests with military force, especially along its borders . Russia advanced its interest with its military force with military forces, especially on its borders.
 NATO's liberal democratic world was seen as an existential threat to Communism . For the Soviet Union's leadership, by contrast, NATO’s liberaldemocratic world was viewed as a threat .
 "This ideological component created a consistent rhetoric of the impossibility of long-term coexistence," he says . The two systems, in fact, continued to coexist, he writes .
 Since IndepencJence Moscow’s relationship with the West since the end of the Cold War has been ambivalent . Strong economic and cultural ties developing even as distrust continued in the security sphere .
 The collapse of the Soviet Union increased the Russian sense of insecurity by leaving many states that had historically been under its influence outside it . Russia's power overall on the world stage was diminished by the collapse of Soviet Union .
 Many of the patterns found in Russian rhetoric and Russian actions since the breakup of the Soviet Union echo those of both the Imperial and the Soviet past .
 As early as 1992, Moscow articulated a prerogative to protect ethnic Russians wherever they may live . Moscow articulated an anti-Russian policy in 1992 .
Russian troops remained deployed throughout its neighborhood in the 1990s, and indeed still remain in many places . Western-leaning Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev articulated a need for Russian peacekeeping in the "near abroad"
 Russian public opinion at the time was generally opposed to military involvement in Russia’s neighborhood .
 Russia’s insistence on maintaining its military presence in Moldova and Georgia led to its suspending implementation of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement in 2007 . Russia's insistence on maintain military presence led to the suspension of the agreement .
 Russia insists on the right to use force in its neighborhood . It was clear that “privileged interests’s’ interests meant that Russia insisted on theRight to use Force in its neighborhoods .
Official Russian statements have included avowals of an absence of enemies since Moscow’s first draft military doctrine in 1992 .
 Russia signed a framework agreement on NATO-Russia relations in 1997 . Russia joined in creating the NATORussia Council in 2002 . Russia signed the framework agreement.
 The EU signed a partnership cooperation agreement with the EU in 1994 and began negotiating a more comprehensive partnership in 2008 . It signed a cooperation agreement in 1994.
 NATO's enlargement into what had been the Soviet sphere of influence over the next decade was met with published documents and statements by Russian officials . Russian officials frequently described NATO as offensive, dangerous, and unreliable .
 Other military leaders took another tack, including by senior military leaders . But other commentary, such as by military leaders, also took a different tack .
 NATO’s enlargement was threatening, and the U.S. and NATO were seeking to weaken Russia, undermine its pursuit of its interests .
 The U.S. and NATO have been identified as potential adversaries in military planning plans .
 Russian analysts have been more likely to combine U.S. and NATO spending and characterize it as growing .
Medvedev’s 2008 call for a new European security architecture was crystallized in 2008 . This view was crystallised in Medvedev's 2008 call.
 Moscow believes that the U.S. is actively seeking to undermine Russian influence by supporting democratic forces . The United States, especially, is actively trying to undermine Russia's influence .
 democracy promotion is what Russian officials are often talking about when they refer critically to Western “intervention’ in their region .
 Statements by officials in the George W Bush administration lauding the spread of democracy played into that perception .
 NATO was seen as dangerous and democracy promotion as anti-Russian . But it did not slow the growth of Russian trade with the European Union or Russian tourism to Western European countries .
 Russia has viewed Western attempts to integrate it more closely into Europe’s political and security institutions as at best inconvenient, and at worst hostile efforts to straitjacket and limit its power .
 Russia had its issues with Brussels, and there is no question that Moscow preferred bilateral relationships with most European states . Russia could negotiate with individual countries from a position of greater relative strength .
 Relations with the EU were further stunted by disputes over visa policy, trade, and Europe’s Third Energy Package .
 Russia has viewed Western attempts to integrate it more closely into Europe’s political and security institutions as at best inconvenient, and at worst hostile efforts to straitjacket and limit its power .
 Despite the loss of significant parts of its empire in 1991, Russia’s geopolitical circumstances have not fundamentally changed . Russia's geopolitical circumstances, and its perceptions of them, have not changed .
 The specifics of the Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014 were still surprising . But the specifics of Russia's intervention in the Ukraine in2014 were still surprises .
 Russia’s conflict with Georgia in 2008 was the endgame of many years of skirmishes and conflict . Most in Moscow predicted an eventual military clash .
 Few inside or outside Russia predicted near-term military action in Ukraine . Tensions had been economic and had previously been resolved without violence .
 Ukraine’s plans to sign the EU Association Agreement had been in the works for years . Russia had not protested them prior to 2013 . 2013 marked a sea change in Russia's attitude toward the European Union .
 Some Russian academics and policymakers had characterized the expanding role of the EU as threatening Russia’s economic interests . The EU's expanding role has been criticized by some Russian academics .
 The EU, like NATO, was described as infringing on Russia’s interests in 2013 . That year, however, the EU was described by the EU as infringement on Russia's interests .
 The idea that Ukraine signing an EU Association Agreement could spark a chain of events culminating in a Russian invasion seemed far-fetched at the time . Despite this shift in rhetoric, however, the idea of Ukraine signing the agreement was still far-far-fetched .
 Russia could easily have concluded that its influence with Kyiv was not at risk from the EU association agreement . The protests in Ukraine’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti began in late 2013 to support EU association and demand the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych .
 Historically, all Ukrainian governments, including those described as “Western-leaning, had made mutually lucrative deals with Russia .
 Russia's and Ukraine's close economic links, including in their mutually dependent defense sectors, had all-but-guaranteed continued cooperation and coordination . Russia and Ukraine’s close economic ties had continued cooperation, coordination .
 Past regimes had threatened a change in attitude, raising questions about the future lease for the Black Sea Fleet .
 Russia’s Parliamentary speaker was insisting that Moscow had no designs on Crimea until just before the Duma voted to accept the peninsula into the Russian fold .
 Russia’s history of insecurity and its tendency to dominate its periphery is an essential backdrop for understanding contemporary Russian foreign policy . It is insufficient to explain Russia's decision to use force in Ukraine and willingness to risk the destruction of two decades of cooperation with Western countries .
 The Role of the Russian Economy in Russian Foreign Policy in Russia’s more-aggressive foreign policy under Putin has had substantial economic consequences . The role of the Russia economy in Russia's more- aggressive foreign policy has had significant economic consequences.

 Russia's crony capitalism has done nothing to limit Russia’s sense that it has a right to dominate its periphery . From a political economic perspective, the crony Capitalism in which Putin and his allies engage has doneNothing to limit Putin's power .
 Russia’s economic growth has been driven in great part by the very integration that its most recent actions have rejected and undermined . But, ironically, Russia's economic growth is driven by the integration of its most-recent actions .
 Russia's crony capitalism in which Putin and his allies engage has done nothing to limit Russia’s sense that it has a right to dominate its periphery . 8 that transformed the Russian economy, after all, flows of finance and people .
 Russian exports of oil and natural gas provided a critical impetus to growth unconnected to institutional and financial integration with the global economy . Russia's high prices for oil and gas provided an impetus for growth in the country .
 Revenues from these exports provided substantial resources for the Russian government and greater freedom of action .
 The present crisis has inflicted severe damage on Russia’s fiscal and economic health, because of both sanctions and investor skittishness . Russia's current crisis has caused severe damage to Russia's fiscal and financial health .
Coincidental decline in export prices for Russian oil and natural gas has exacerbated these effects . Meanwhile, the decline in oil and gas prices has exacerbated the effects of the decline .
 Putin’s terms in office as both president and prime minister oversaw record economic growth for Russia . Russia raised the country to the ranks of the upper middle-income states .
Economic growth has been a key element of Putin’s high approval ratings . Social and political stability has been key to Putin's high approval rating .

 Russia was evicted from the G-8 on March 24, 2014, in response to its annexation of Crimea . Russia was also evicted in March 2014, following Crimea's annexation .
 Russian leaders have seen membership in these international organizations as validating Russia’s role in the world . Russia has a venue in which to pursue Russian economic interests .
 Putin attended the Group of 20 in Australia in 2014, even as his fellow participants condemned his policies in Ukraine . This is demonstrated by Putin’s attendance at the group of 20 .
 Russia's senior leadership in Russia's Petersburg Forum is another example of continued outreach . Consistent participation by Russia’s senior leadership is an example of continuing outreach .
 In 2012, the EU purchased 52 percent of all Russia’s exports and accounted for 42 percent of its imports . In 2013, Russia's exports accounted for 52% of its exports .

 The EU has been the largest recipient, as Russian investors have put funds into bank accounts there and purchased EU stocks, bonds, and real estate . The EU is the biggest recipient of the EU, with more than 1,000 Russian investors .
 Russians can bring back untaxed funds to invest in their businesses . EU banks, especially in Cyprus, have also been handy for Russians to bring back funds .
 Russians may prefer EU bank accounts because they see them as more secure than Russian banks . Russian banks may also prefer EU accounts because of their security .
 Russia and Russians have integrated their finances with the European financial system . As a consequence, Russia and Russia has integrated their financial system with the EU .
 EU companies, banks, and other investors poured money into Russia, financing the development of financial services, retail and wholesale trade, housing construction, and telecommunications sectors .
 They have also financed large investments in energy and infrastructure . They are also investing in energy, infrastructure and infrastructure.
 Russian investors have brought to the Russian economy . Capital inflows have been the key to the success of Russian investors .
 Much of the rapid productivity growth in Russia between 1998 and 2008 stemmed from direct foreign investment by Russian entrepreneurs .
 The reluctance of Russia to expropriate foreign investors reflects the importance of foreign investors for Russian economic growth . Russia's reluctance to exropriate the holdings of foreign investment reflects its reluctance to do so, as sanctions took hold .
 The treaty increased the European Parliament’s authority over trade policy . In addition, it increased the EU Parliament's authority overtrade policy .
 Russia preferred to deal with the member states directly, as it felt it had more leverage when dealing with member states on an individual basis . These changes sat poorly with Russia, according to the Russian government .
 Russia was especially put out by the EU’s Third Energy package, which was directed in great part at diversifying EU sources of supply of natural gas . Gazprom's ability to engage in price discrimination, thereby reducing profits from its natural gas exports to member states .
 The Russian government sees its fellow postSoviet states as within its sphere of influence .
 Russia sometimes used force to ensure that its security interests were upheld . It had less success in insisting on its economic prerogatives .
 Russia’s economic relations with Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Kazakhstan have diminished over the last two decades relative to ties with the EU .
 Between 2000 and 2012, Russia's total imports fell from 35 percent to 13 percent . The share of these countries held in Russia’s total imports in Russia fell to 35 percent .
 Russian exports to these states dropped from 19 percent to 14 percent after the 1998 crisis . The EU and Ghina have taken Russian market share in this part of the world .
 Russia’s near neighbors have not been an important source of foreign investment for Russia . Russian firms are often important investors in these countries .
 There has been surprisingly little discussion by Russian academics or policymakers on the potential economic effects of the customs union on the economies of Russia or other member states .
 The Russian government has been concerned about its declining economic role in its neighborhood .
 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia and its neighbors have taken a number of legal and institutional steps to try to keep economic ties strong .
 The Commonwealth of Independent States was created December 8, 1991, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union . The first was the Commonwealth of independent States .
 Its founding members were Russia and all other former Soviet republics except the Baltic states . The CIS was primarily designed to assist with issues pertaining to trade, currencies, economic statistics, labor mobility, and financial transactions .
 Russia and its fellow Soviet successor states have experimented with a number of agreements concerning free trade, common tariffs, and other economic arrangements . Since then, Russia has experimented with free trade and common tariffs .
 These have been helpful in reducing barriers to trade, albeit not as much as they might have been . These have helped reduce barriers, but not as many as they may have been.
 The EU and its predecessor organizations have different approaches to dealing with the EU . The arrangements have differed crucially from those taken by the EU and their predecessor organizations .
 The CIS and other efforts to foster economic ties in the post-Soviet space consistently have run aground on the refusal of members, including Russia, to abide by their rules . The EU is fundamentally a rules-based organization, the CIS and others .
 Russia slapped anti-dumping suits and higher tariffs on imports of Ukrainian steel pipe in 2007 . For example, Russia slappedAnti-Dumping suits, higher tariffs and anti- dumping suits in 2007.
 Russia’s initiative to create a Eurasian Customs Union, and later Eurasian Union, with states in the region doing little to improve on agreements already on the books . Russia's initiative is to create an Eurasian customs union .
 The Customs Union seems to be more a reactive device to prevent members from negotiating free trade or association agreements with the EU than a mechanism for increasing economic integration between Russia and its neighbors .
 A handful of studies forecast gains in the medium run through reductions in transaction costs and the expansion of intraregional trade .
 Kazakhstan has had to increase tariffs on about 50 percent of its imports . It is likely to result in losses on interregional trade .
 Customs Union authors expect high levels of compliance with its terms . But given the history of implementation of past economic agreements among post-Soviet states, it is hard to imagine that they expect high compliance .
 Kazakh Ministry of Investment and Development had introduced licenses for car imports from member states of the Eurasian Economic Union . Russian cars had become much cheaper following the sharp fall of the Russian ruble .
 The Customs Union makes it difficult for members to sign Association Agreements with the EU without Russian consent .
 This means that members will be forced to forgo substantial opportunities to enhance ties with EU states and bolster economic growth . This means members will have more opportunities to boost ties with European states .
 The Customs Union is geared to limit EU influence rather than enhance the economies of Russia or its neighbors . This fits well with the general opposition to integration, for itself and its neighbors, that has been a hallmark of more recent Russian policy .
 Russia has sought to use economic levers to pursue political goals vis-a-vis its neighbors, particularly Ukraine . Russia has also sought to seek political goals with economic levers .
 Preferential sales were seen as supporting the economies of these countries during difficult times, hopefully damping unrest .
 Russia has also sought to use economic levers to pursue political goals vis-a-vis its neighbors, particularly Ukraine . elites, including by providing opportunities for them to resell lowpriced Russian natural gas at higher prices to EU member states.
 Russia punished Gazprom by asking Gazprom to raise prices to levels higher than those paid by Western European states . Ukraine and Georgia pursued policies that Russia frowned upon, Russia said .
 Moscow's economic policy has focused on liberalizing the economy and integrating it into global markets . The central thrust of Moscow’s approaches over the last two decades has been to liberalize the economy .
 Officials and private interests have simultaneously pushed in the other direction, seeking more state intervention in the economy and more protection for local industries .
 Putin, many in his inner circle, and managers of state-controlled companies have resuscitated policies focused on protecting Russian businesses . Over the past decade, Putin's policies have been focused on promoting state- controlled champions .
 Putin has put forward several plans to create state champions in oil and maintain state control in natural gas . Putin has also put forward plans to promote state arms manufacturers .
 Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has taken the lead on developing technology parks . It seems highly unlikely that this initiative would have gone forward without Putin’s support .
 Russian leaders view these initiatives as making the Russian state stronger and restoring it as a great technological and economic power . Russian leaders say these initiatives are making the state stronger .
 The creation of United Aircraft Corporation and other state-controlled champions in the arms sector was seen as an important component of restoring Russia’s military power .
 The destruction of the Yukos oil company and the arrest and incarceration of its CEO, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, in 2003 sent a clear signal to potential rivals of Putin among the oligarchs . It also shifted oil fields and assets from a private-sector company into state-controlled Ross
 Putin took over Yukos, the most prominent company in Russia . Yukos was not the only company he took over .
 Kahka Bendukidze, a Georgian businessman, felt pressured to sell his company, Obedinennie Mashinostroitelnie Zavody, to Gazprom at a marked-down price .
 Russian leaders likely sought to regain state control of key components of Bendukidze’s portfolio .
 Russian managers of state-controlled companies and administration officials have benefited from sales . State-controlled firms are able to provide patronage and, in some cases, siphon money into their pockets .
Private-sector agricultural interests have pushed to block such competing imports as chicken or other agricultural products . Concerns about food quality and sanitation as a rationale .
 Some private-sector elites have had some influence on policy through both open and covert mechanisms . It does appear that on economic issues, in sharp contrast to security issues, some have some influence .
 The Russian government has also insisted on local content clauses and provided special tax benefits for foreign investors in industries considered strategic .
 The transfer of privately owned assets back to state control has imposed costs on the Russian economy . The transfer has imposed cost on Russian economy.

 Russia has entered a period of slow growth, partly because of a shift toward greater state intervention in the Russian economy .
 Economics and the Ukraine Crisis Joining the WTO, opening up previously protected sectors, and providing protections to Western businesses . The Kremlin has pursued integration and growth in the past .
 At the same time, it has occasionally veered from those goals to please economic elites and maintain its capacity to distribute rents . The government has sometimes veered away from that goal to please the economic elites .
 The Gustoms Union generally and Ukraine policy specifically do not appear to be driven by national or parochial economic interests .
 The Southern Machine Building Plant Association in Dnipropetrovsk has been an important source of components . Zaporozhye-based helicopter engine manufacturer Motor Sich has been a key source.
 The current conflict puts an end to these relationships, possibly for good, and thus damaging Russia’s defense sector . Russia's defense sector is in the midst of a conflict with Russia .
 EU and Russia’s embargo of imports of selected foods from countries that have imposed sanctions have had substantial economic costs . Financial and other economic sanctions imposed by the EU.
 Russia may not have expected these developments, it has accepted them, and has not taken steps to reverse the situation . Russia has not been able to reverse it.
 The annexation of Crimea also appears to run counter to Russia’s economic interests .
 Crimea’s primary economic activities have been tourism and hosting the Russian Black Sea fleets . Crimea's main economic activities are tourism, hosting the Black Sea fleet .
 Crimea has struggled to compete with Turkey, Egypt, and other tourist destinations . As incomes rose in the last decade, Crimea's incomes have risen .
 Russians and Ukrainians, a strong traditional tourist base for the peninsula, have found these new destinations provide better services and lower prices . Russia and Ukrainians are a strongtraditional tourist base.
 Ukrainians no longer frequent Crimean resorts after annexation of Crimea . Crimea has been annexed by Ukraine .
 Despite patriotic pleas, Russians have also shown no more interest, so this component of the Crimean economy is suffering . The Crimean economy has been suffering .
 Ukraine has restricted trade across the new de facto border, so costs of food and other products have risen . Crimeans have had to transport substitute supplies from Russia over longer, more expensive transportation routes .
 Russia has countered these economic problems by subsidizing transportation costs . Russia has subsidized transportation costs by subsidising transportation costs.
 Russia now also covers pensions for the large population of elderly Crimeans, estimated at $1 billion per year . Russia also covers pension for large number of Crimeans .
 Russia has promised to build a $7 billion bridge to Russian territory . Russia has also promised to building $7billion bridge to Russia .
 Russia today seems to see economic policy as one more area through which to exercise influence in its neighborhood . Russia today sees economic policy in alignment with what it sees as its broader strategic interests .
 Russia has shown that it is willing to incur substantial economic costs in pursuit of its goals in Ukraine and elsewhere . Russia has also shown that its willingness to incur significant economic costs for its goals .
 Moscow has come to see economic integration in the same light as political integration as a political danger . Despite the many economic benefits it has brought Russia to date, it appears to be a political risk .
 The Role of Elite and Public Opinion in Russian Foreign Policy is difficult to argue for any group or individual's influence being decisive in a system as centralized as Russia’s has become .
 Putin seems to care a great deal about what the Russian public, if not its elite, thinks, and will go to some lengths to shape those thoughts . The Russian president seems to be concerned about what his country's elite thinks .
 This is largely because it is easier to control the country if public views are favorable to the regime . This is because it's easier to Control the country with public views.
 Neither elite nor public views on specific issues appear to drive Russian policy, but the regime is deeply fearful of elite and public opposition to its actions .
 There are a few possible counters to this view that are worth examining individually . There are some possible counters that areworth examining individually.
 The intelligence service, where Putin made his career, is often viewed as particularly important . But it is not entirely clear that the intelligence services have affected foreign and security policy decisions .
 There is no evidence that agencies are propounding specific policies . The agencies’ budgets have risen, but there is no proof that they are.
 The military has enjoyed increasing resources in recent years, but it does not appear to have been particularly influential on matters outside of its purview . The military maintains responsibility for military strategy and force structure .
 The Russian Orthodox Church has benefited from growing ties with both Putin and Medvedev . The Orthodox Church is in a strong relationship with the Russian president .
 The church and its teachings are consistently used as a reference point for Russia’s newfound ideology of conservative values . Some say the church is part of the logic for closer ties between Russia and other post-Soviet countries .
 The church has spoken out on both Ukraine and Syria, rather than led . The comments have followed, instead than led, in the past .
 The church is affecting Russian security policy rather than being used by the state to justify it . For now, we remain skeptical that the church is affected by the church .
 In the months following the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, President Putin’s domestic approval ratings were consistently above 80 percent .
 The 2011 downturn in public support for Putin coincided roughly, if imperfectly, with two factors . The 2011 drop in public supports for Putin coincides roughly with the 2011 downturn .
 Putin’s polling numbers dropped slightly in 2009, but remained in the high 70s or better until the end of 2010 .
Economic pressures led some Russians to have less faith in their leadership, one might conclude . One might conclude that economic pressures led to some Russian leaders to have fewer faith .
 urban Russians took to the streets starting in the winter of 2011-2012 . The other is a series of protests in which urban Russians started to take to the street .
 Some Russians were willing to attend public protests to show their anger . Others may have become less supportive of the government in a quieter way . Putin’s polling numbers have dropped into the high 60s .
 Russians clearly have views, however, it is not clear that these views constrain their government or cause it to adjust foreign policy .
 Russian foreign policy would consistently change to accommodate the polling numbers and demonstrators . If that were the case, Russia would change its foreign policy .
 In contrast to foreign policy, it is possible to point to examples of where demonstrations and popular discontent led to changes in domestic economic policy .
In 2005, pensioners demanded and got pension increases that were higher than originally planned, to offset cutbacks in nonmonetary benefits . For example, in 2005, in 2004, pensioner demands and gets pension increases.
 Putin administration seeks to sway more people to support what it planned to do anyway . Putin administration seems to care what the electorate thinks, rather than adjusting approaches and pleasing more people .
 Under Putin, this has involved concerted efforts to delegitimize the opposition, increase limits on press freedom, and promote conservative, “Russian’s values as an antidote to Western liberalism .
 Russia’s government is also not above misrepresenting its policies to maintain support, as shown by continuing denials of Russian troops in Ukraine . Russia is trying to hide evidence of the deaths occurring there .
Russian activist Alexei Navalny was tried and convicted of embezzlement and fraud . Khodorkovsky is the most obvious and prominent example from Putin's leadership .
 27 cases have been tried against members of the performance art collective Pussy Riot . Other prominent trials have included that of three members of Pussy riot and 27 cases still in progress .

Opponents of Russian government policies are foreign-backed, especially by the U.S. The campaign is a concerted strategy .
 This applies beyond Russia and, of course, aligns with the broader view of Western intentions and influence discussed above . This applies to Russia and beyond Russia .
 Putin and others in his administration have accused the U.S. of orchestrating the so-called Color Revolutions . Mass protests led to government overthrows in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan in the 2000s .
 The U.S. was also portrayed as being behind the “Arab Spring’s” protests of 2010 and the ‘Euromaidan’ movement in Ukraine . The fall of the Yanukovych government in February 2014 led to the fall of Yanukovych government .
 Various legal pretexts have long been used to harass and intimidate organizations with foreign ties . Many of these have been used as pretexts for harassment and intimidation .
 Petersburg, which is partially funded by Western donors and foundations, was shuttered for six weeks in early 2008 for alleged violations of Are safety regulations .
 Organizations such as the Soldiers Mothers’ Committee and the human rights organization Memorial have faced substantial harassment under the 2012 “foreign agents’ law and organizations with any connections to the United States are increasingly under pressure .

Early in Putin's first term as president, the regime took over NTV, at that time the only national private TV channel . NTV was the only private television channel.
 State encroachment on freedom of the press has been documented by both Western and Russian scholars . Since then, state encroachment has beendocumented by both West and Russian scholar .
Major outlets have increasingly taken great care since 2000 not to criticize the president and to limit critiques of the government .
 In its milder manifestations, it continues to take more traditional forms, such as government discussions with, and suggestions to, journalists regarding what to cover and how .
 Laws prohibiting ‘obscene’ and “extremist’ content have targeted journalists critical of the government .
 Recent amendments to the media law have made these provisions. Limiting opposition views also means limiting press coverage critical of the government .
Constraints on media freedom in modern Russia have a long history . 18 applicable to online sources as well as online sources .
 Cable carriers reported that government pressure was a factor in dropping the Dozhd’ television channel in early 2014 . The channel was forced to broadcast from a private apartment, having been evicted from two locations .
 Much of her staff resigned in protest and the new Lenta.ru toes a much more government-friendly line . Much of the staff resigned.
 The Kremlin has helped ensure that the mass media that do reach most Russians put forward an explicitly progovernment message, as well as a nationalistic one . In addition to limiting access to nongovernment-controlled media and delegitimizing the opposition.
 Leitmotifs of Russian pride and readings of history to support that pride are prevalent in a storyline of a resurgent Russia .
 The pattern can also be found in government statements and school textbooks . This applies not just to media, but to government statements .
 Individuals who voice these views most effectively have enjoyed success in recent years . Dmitry Kiselev is one of the best examples of those who have done so .
 Kiselev, a popular commentator on Russian television Channel 1, was appointed in 2013 to run the media conglomerate Rossiya Segodnya . The media conglomerate replaced RIA Novosti and also includes the Voice of Russia radio station .
 Kiselev’s off-hand homophobia and criticism of Western culture fit well with the narrative of Russian traditionalism and of Russia standing up to the bullying West . Kiseslev's criticism of the West fits well with his narrative of traditionalism .
 As the Ukraine crisis escalated, he used his television news pulpit to point out Russia's ability to turn the United States into radioactive ash .
Russian public opinion on foreign policy issues has tended to side with government positions during times of crisis . Historically, even when the press was freer, Russian public opinion has been freer .
Crises in U.S.-Russian relations have consistently led to more negative views of America . But these views have reversed themselves when the crisis eased, says John Sutter .
 Most populations are affected by the information available, but also affected by information available . Most people are affected, but most are affected.
 RAND PEI 14-4 its own views both of events in Ukraine and of Western fault in those events to its public, and to have those views be accepted .
 The Russian public's continuing support of its government in the foreign policy sphere is likely a result of both a general predilection to support the government on such issues and the appeal of the specific messages that the Kremlin has used .
 As the economy deteriorates, nationalism may provide some social cohesion and support for the regime .
 The Russian government knows what it is doing by limiting alternative viewpoints and putting forward a nationalistic storyline, particularly in a time of crisis .
Public support is important for Putin administration, says Putin administration . Putin administration is trying to mold public opinion, says Obama .
 The escalation of such efforts since 2011’s protests and the slight drop in Putin's public opinion numbers in that year speaks to a government view that such things could get worse if left unchanged .
 Public opinion may not shape foreign policy in Russia directly, but it is, evidently, very important to the Kremlin .
 Russia's government has expressed concern over "Color Revolutions" as already discussed . One argument holds that hybrid governments such as Russia’s benefit from retaining democratic elements .
 There is no doubt that such movements have often been successful in ousting regimes from power . There are no doubts about the degree of foreign backing for protest movements around the world .
 The fact that this has taken place in neighboring post-Soviet countries that have much in common with Russia politically and socially is not lost on the Kremlin .
 Yanukovych’s flight from Ukraine must have been a nightmare scenario for the Kremlin . The inability of the Yanokovych government to effectively control the situation has been a problem for the Russian government .
Despite high levels of corruption, consistently poor governance, and much lower living standards. Despite high levels, there is still a lot of poor governance .
 Ukraine had a substantially stronger civil society and freer press than Russia . Ukraine's civil society was stronger than Russia's, according to the report .
Close cultural and linguistic ties between the two countries mean that there are many parallels .
 Russian officials may well have feared that the Ukrainian example could spur imitation at home .
 Some analysts argue that with Russian foreign policy so centralized, policy toward Ukraine is simply the result of Putin himself . Proponents of this outlook point to the somewhat more accommodating line Russia took toward the West under Medvedev .
 Putin’s view of foreign policy is deeply shaped by his own experience, including as a former KGB officer . A zero-sum, strictly realpolitik view of the world permeates all his interactions with the West .
 Decisionmaking in Russia is highly centralized and has become more so under Putin’s rule .
 The personal image that Putin has sought to project aligns well with the overall narrative of a reborn Russia . Putin's personal image has been seen as a personal image.
 Putin's image has been carefully orchestrated from the time of his anointment as Yeltsin's successor . Putin’s image was carefully orchestrated.
 He was initially presented as a contrast to Yeltsin, a sober professional . He was originally presented as an contrast to the sober professional. He has been described as "a sober professional"
 Putin presents himself as a churchgoer who has close ties with the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church . The Patriarch has been very supportive of Putin's rule .
 His is the key voice for all elements of Russian policy, foreign and domestic, from standing up to Western bullying to rejection of Euro-Atlantic integration for both Russia and its neighbors .
 Putin has worked to ensure that both Putin and Putin continue to become stronger . This statist philosophy fits with the concept of a strong executive, of course, and the two reinforce one another .
 A state that cannot control its citizenry is clearly not strong and will not succeed or survive . A state can't control the citizenry, a state against which its citizens might revolt, is not strong, says author .
 Analysts have argued that Putin's personal views about history, relations with other European powers and with the U.S. have driven his policy positions .
 Putin is indeed at the center of decisionmaking, says CNN's John Sutter . Putin's decisions are a product of both historical Russian strategic perspectives and his regime's concerns about maintaining his power in the future .
 Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a number of changes to his government since 2014 . The changes were made in 2014 and since may have been Putin's, they are now a part of Russian policy .
 Putin's successors likely to be prone to the same foreign policy patterns we have seen in recent months . This means that as long as Putin’s successors seek to continue the authoritarian regime he has built, they are likely to have the same policy patterns .
 Different personalities may lead those responses to manifest in different ways, but the core themes will be similar . The core themes of the book will be the same .
 Governments do not always behave in predictable ways, and political science hardly provides a crystal ball . Political science is not always predictable, but political science is very different .
 understanding the likely sources of Russia’s behavior in Ukraine can help decisionmakers formulate policy regarding Russia in the future .
 How the U.S. and its allies interpret Russian foreign policy today has important implications . How to restore and maintain security in Europe is a key question .
 Our assessment enables us to reject several of the hypotheses presented at the start of this analysis . We also reject many of the hypothesis presented in the analysis .
 Russia's actions do not appear to have been significantly motivated by fears that Ukraine’s Association Agreement with the EU would be costly for the Russian economy .
 The seizure of Crimea and the war in Ukraine also do not appear to have been driven by an effort to court Russian public opinion . A concerted and successful effort has kept the Russian public firmly behind the government .
 Russia's foreign policy is rooted in longstanding beliefs about its rights within its region . At its core, Russia’s foreign policies are rooted in long-held beliefs about rights in the region .
Post-Soviet view of a continued competition with the United States is seen as a mechanism of controlling and weakening Russia . These are exacerbated by a consistent post- Soviet view of the U.S.
 The current regime harbors deep fears about the effects of pro-democracy or pro-European forces that have increasingly surrounded it since the end of the Cold War .
 Russia, in general, and Putin, specifically, see Ukraine as unquestionably belonging in Moscow’s strategic orbit . Ukraine is not the EU's.
 The Kremlin was angry at what it saw as Western “interference’ in Ukraine, to which it attributed the Maidan protests and most opposition to the Yanukovych regime .
 These protests were also a challenge to Putin’s personal belief in a strong state at the vanguard of society, a belief shared by those around him .
 If such protests could happen in Ukraine, they might happen in Russia as well . Ukraine was so culturally similar to Russia, it was viewed as an auxiliary nation .
 The 2011-2012 protests in Moscow seemed all the more menacing to Putin’s grip on power .
 Putin took action not simply to counter what he saw as Western activity on Russia’s border and to maintain influence in Ukraine .
 Russia has annexed Crimea and helped maintain a conflict in eastern Ukraine to prevent this overthrow of the existing order . The current government is a semi-successful, but still functioning, one author says .
 The threat to the Russian state is what led Russia to risk incurring substantial economic costs . Russia is seen as one with the Russian government, not to the status quo in Ukraine .
 Putin’s personal leadership style and viewpoints were likely critical to the specific actions that were taken . Putin's personal behavior was likely critical, but not to the attitudes that drove them .
 Russia's decision to annex the peninsula was probably a decision taken by Putin with little consultation . The decision was likely to be made by Putin, as was done in the East .
 At the same time, there was likely an evolutionary and responsive quality to Russia’s actions . Russia's actions were likely to be more responsive and evolutionary .
 The Kremlin could not have predicted the exact effects of its actions in Crimea .
 It is certainly plausible that the success of that operation spurred increased activity in Eastern and Southern Ukraine . It is also plausible that that operation led to increased activity.
 The last year and a half should make all wary of efforts to predict Russian policy and actions . For one thing, it should be wary of attempts to predict Russia's actions .
 Rather, it behooves Western governments to prepare for a range of possible outcomes, both good and bad . The U.S. should prepare for the range of potential outcomes, not just good or bad .
 Russia may again overreact or behave in ways that other states see as irrational and counterproductive . Russia may seek what seems to be a more rational path, or it may seek something more rational .
Future Russian governments will likely remain paranoid about Western intentions, both within Russia and on its borders . Regardless, even if the current crisis cools, future Russian governments may remain paranoid .
 It will see Western efforts to weaken and undermine it in most U.S. and NATO member actions . It will tend to place any disagreements or conflicts into a narrative that juxtaposes Russia and the United States, downplaying other powers .
 Moscow will almost certainly insist on holding on to Crimea regardless of what else happens . Meanwhile, Moscow will most likely hold on to the Crimea .
 Some level of sanctions and tension will remain whether the situation in Ukraine overall escalates or not . This means that some levels of sanctions, and tension, will remain .
 European and U.S. efforts to put economic and political pressure on Russia seem unlikely to be sufficient to force the Kremlin to withdraw from Ukraine in the near term .
 The financial and military costs of occupying parts of Ukraine will eventually begin to take a toll, however . The financial, military costs will eventually start to take the toll .
 Russia does not seek Ukraine’s territory, so much as its acquiescence to Russian domination . It is important to note that Russia doesn't seek Ukraine's territory .
 If Russia does not back down, both it and Ukraine will surely suffer further economic and human losses in the coming years . If Russia doesn't back down. Both Russia and Ukraine are likely to suffer more economic, human losses .
 Russia may eventually recognize how counterproductive keeping military forces in Ukraine is . The Maidan government put in place by the Maidan is probably unlikely for some time to come .
 This could lead Moscow to withdraw its troops, regular and irregular, and most of its support from the Donbass . Moscow is holding on to Crimea and settling for a low level of unrest in the East .
 Ongoing unrest there could be sufficient for Russian leaders to point to as a cautionary tale of the risks of seeking Western support for democratic reform .
 The worst possibility is one in which Moscow escalates conflict with the West in Ukraine or elsewhere .
 NATO and the European Union should not rely on Russian economic weaknesses alone to preclude further aggression on Moscow’s part, says Peter Bergen . Bergen: Russia's capabilities are limited .
 The Russian armed forces have improved substantially over the past decade, particularly in the wake of reforms instituted in 2008 . But they remain best suited for limited local conflict .
 Moscow has touted grandiose plans for continued military development . But these are already well behind schedule .
 The Kremlin insists it is prepared to continue military investment as planned . The tightening of Russian federal budgets is in the wake of continued economic crisis .
 Russia may have failed to predict the response of both the West and Ukraine itself to Moscow’s actions over the past two years . Russia must recognize that a lengthy occupation of a hostile neighbor, whether Ukraine or one of the Baltics, would soon turn very ugly .
 The risk of further Russian aggression in the near future. Collectively, these factors diminish, but do not eliminate, the risk of Russian aggression .
 It will seek, within its capabilities, to keep them at a distance, and provide the opportunity, weaken and undermine them, including through force of arms . It will also seek to keep it from being used by its own forces .
 These policies are in keeping with long-standing historical Russian patterns. These policies have been in keeping.
 Whatever happens in Ukraine, Russia will pose a challenge for the U.S. and its allies for years to come .
 Moscow’s goals likely still evolving and its interests competing. But with Moscow's goals likely to be evolving, its interests are still competing .
 NATO and the European Union will be best served by a strategy that hedges against the worst possible outcomes . But not give up on Russia in the long-run.
 The West has embarked upon a new era in relations with Russia, one that calls for greater vigilance, new strategic vision, and a consistent, long-term effort to rebuild the stability that has been lost in Ukraine .
 Our analysis does not follow this format perfectly, particularly in separating out economic factors, both international and domestic, as a separate section . It does borrow heavily from the general approach, but it does not.
