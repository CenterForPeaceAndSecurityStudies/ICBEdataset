 Russian photographer Oksana Yushko discusses her work highlighting mixed marriages during the Russian-Ukrainian conflict .
 Yushko was born and raised in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city . She is now based in Moscow, but grew up in Ukraine .
 Engelina's mother, Engelina, is Russian, and her father, Viktor, Ukrainian . When they married more than fifty years ago, they formed a union that was, to everyone at the time, utterly normal .
 The ‘mixed’ nature of the marriage, Yushko says, is hardly merited mentioning .
 Kharkiv, located in what is today the northeastern quadrant of Ukraine, is only a forty minute drive from the Russian-Ukrainian border . Kharkv is only 40 minutes from the border .
 The mixing of families was simply a fact of life in the Soviet Union, especially between Russians and Ukrainians, the two largest ethnic groups .
Following the fall of the USSR and Ukraine’s subsequent national independence, Russia and the European Union began a tug-of-war for influence in Ukraine .
 Tensions came to a head when President Viktor Yanukovych strayed from Ukraine’s association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties to Moscow .
 Shortly after Yanukovych’s announcement, the widely-covered Euromaidan protests began .
 Parliament voted to remove Yanukovych from his position in early 2014 . Petro Poroshenko was elected in his place .
 The push-and-pull of Russia and the European Union reached a new height around the same time .
 In March of 2014, Putin announced his country’s annexation of Crimea, a peninsula that joined Ukraine to Russia . The Crimea peninsula joined Ukraine in March 2014 .
 Social media was aflame following the annexation of Ukraine's Russian-speaking eastern regions . Following the annexation, the subsequent militia-led uprisings in Ukraine’s eastern regions were aflame .
 Russians and Ukrainians no longer saw themselves as neighbors, Yushko says . "All of a sudden, they were enemies," he says .
 Yushko thought of her own parents, Engelina and Viktor, and of their 50-year marriage, which had never been political . She thought of herself and her parents, who had never had a political marriage .
 Yushko’s project is about showcasing the coexistence and love . The first photograph of the series was of the parents in their home in Ukraine .
 Despite the fiery rhetoric on social media, the reception of her work was positive .
 Familia talks about her experiences during the conflict, her own family, and the future of Familia . She also discusses her family and her future of the family .
 I always say the most difficult thing for me was when my friends became enemies of one another . They just saw things on social media, reading the news, watching TV, and they became very aggressive, he says .
 The level of aggression was very high in the spring of 2014, after Crimea. I remember very clearly, it was in the Spring of 2014. It was in Crimea, and the level of aggressiveness was high .
 I visited my parents in May of 2014, and it was just… an instant idea that I had. It was just a instant idea, and I had an idea of visiting my parents .
 The photograph was put online and I put it next to it. But I put the photograph online and made my statement . I put my statement next to the photograph and put it on the page .
Photographer: If I were a journalist, I would have written something much longer to go with it . But I'm a photographer, he says .
 They also care and they want to live under peaceful skies . But I think they could be a model for other people in the world .
 There were so many likes, reposts, and shares, and they wrote, “Yeah, it’s true. And suddenly, like I said, there was lots of aggression from people on social media.
 The project started to invite other people to participate in this kind of project . And they started to ask others to take part .
 The author asked friends to share their stories and if they knew other similar families, to ask them to participate . So I asked them to share .
 It became… my duty, and so I would take photos for it as often as I could at that time, because I understood that it was important . And so it became… his duty, so he would take pictures for it, because he understood that he was important.
 It was published worldwide, and during that half a year there was a lot of interest . The book is published worldwide and was published globally .
 People stopped being friends. I try not to remember, but I know that it was just very ordinary things . It was just a very ordinary thing, she says .
 It's not like that, it's a mix of situations, of cultures, of opinions, of people’s thoughts, of bits of propaganda, of propaganda. Because it’'s not just like that. It’‘It’�s
 There are so many to what was going on that it’s very difficult to say things are black and white, love and hate, this or that, it's difficult to tell .
When you have different opinions but can’t get to the truth, the fighting just goes on forever . I heard for example that there was a couple that had almost divorced because they had different opinions .
 The couple was about to divorce, but they couldn't just move out of this apartment . They are both living in this apartment that they rent .
 I was told that after they saw the project, they began to think about things differently, and they vowed to stay together . The project is a collaboration between two young men .
 I’ve received many very positive opinions from people from abroad. I think it’s very easy to have an opinion when you read the news, or watch TV, especially when you live very far from the conflict and that's all you see. I
 When people see the project, they start to think differently about the whole situation, they see it differently . So when these people, too, see the whole thing, they think differently .
 The author has been working on a series of projects for the U.S. National Geographic . He's been working with CNN's John Sutter for more than a decade .

 Most of the time, you're meeting them for the first time and you’re in their homes with them . You’s in their home with them.
 The author doesn't spend that much time with each family, three, four hours at most . That's why he doesn’t spend much time at each family .
 Most of the time I photograph them while we’re talking, it’s not staged photography . The photos are taken while we're talking, not staged photographs .
 If they agree to be photographed, I think they don't have very different opinions . But I say that if they live together, they don’t havevery different opinions, I say .
 It's easy to ask them about the situation, actually, says CNN's John Sutter . "I think that's why it’s easy to question them," he says .
President Obama has said he's not very professional about politics . He's just telling you what he feels, he says .
 A huge exhibition was held in March or April in Kiev, Ukraine . It was much better than two years ago, says the author .
 The Chechnya region is in the Donbas region of Russia . The region has been in the midst of a violent conflict in recent years .
 At the beginning of 2016, I think it’s an even better situation. And now, at the start of the year, it's a better situation, I say .
 There are many, many different things happening at once, says CNN's John Sutter . "It’s not a black and white conflict," he says .
 People don't just blame the other side, they blame their own government . Now, people don’t just blame each other, they also blame their government .
 I don't think there was as much aggression from Russians towards Ukrainians, of course, because the conflict was happening in Ukraine, not in Russia . I don’t think there were as much aggressions from Russians against Ukrainians .
 Ukrainians who lived abroad but had friends, relatives, colleagues, who were close to the conflict . I do, but also from Ukrainians who live abroad and had friends and relatives . I'm not only from Ukrainians but from Ukrainians living abroad but with friends and colleagues .
 The people who live in the Donetsk region don't want the conflict to be in their area . The Donetsk region is in the eastern part of the Donetsk area .
 It’s not that they want to be in Russia or in Ukraine, they just want things to calm down . It's not that the people in Ukraine want to go to Russia or Russia, it's just that they don't want to stay in Russia .
 The first photograph in this series is one of your parents, at home in Ukraine . The first photo is of your mother at home.
 My mom was born in Russia, and then because of her grandfather, he was a military man . Their family travelled a lot, and their family travels a lot .
 The children were born in 1936 and 1937 . They were very young during the war . Their father was moved there for work .
In the USSR, it was fairly normal to come from a mixed Russian-Ukrainian marriage . I would imagine that in the USSR. I would Imagine that in Russia, it would have been fairly normal .
 "Somebody went to go live here, went to study there," says author . "It was such a big area. You would hear stories"
 Kazakh people living somewhere in Central Russia, or for example, after deportations, many Chechens used to live in Kazakhstan . It's all because of our history that we have this mixing.
 There were several situations when I thought that I would need to go to Ukraine and take them out immediately . There were many situations when he thought that he would need a trip to Ukraine .
 Some Russian vehicles had crossed over the border with Ukraine, says CNN's Tom Charity .

 In Kharkiv, there was one major explosion at a rally, but that was it .
I think I'll keep working on this project until… it's over for me. It’s not that way anymore. I mostly do assignments and personal projects, but I think I’ll keep working for me .
 Nobody is interested anymore, the people who live there. It’s not like the conflict is over, it's not like it is over .
