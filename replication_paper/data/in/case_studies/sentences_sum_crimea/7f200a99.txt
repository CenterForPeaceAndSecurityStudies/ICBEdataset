 ABSTRACT Social Movement Theory came into being during the 1960s . It is a compact model for analyzing organizations pursuing political objectives .
 SMT analyses everything from civil rights groups to religious insurgencies . Using the tripartite structure of ideological framing, resource mobilization, and political opportunity, academics and practitioners use SMT .
 There is no existing SMT application to the “gray zone,’s one of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. today .
 This thesis reviews the current literature on both the gray zone and SMT . It then applies the model to case studies on Russia and Ukraine . The thesis reviews current literature.
 SMT can identify existing sources of tension in a gray zone adversary, likely vulnerabilities in a target region, and potential countermeasures for senior strategists .

 Henry Kissinger used the term to describe countries along the Sino-Soviet periphery where the U.S. could employ limited means, instead of nuclear weapons, to resist and exhaust communist efforts .
Ground forces have not traditionally had to operate, but one in which they must now become more proficient. Now, that’s the zone in which our ground forces must now be more proficient .
 Countries that use gray zone strategies against the United States, hereafter known as “adversaries,’ have several common characteristics .
First, they exert political control over a clear geographic area, which distinguishes adversaries from terrorist and criminal organizations . First, the group exerts political control on a clear area .
Adversaries have important national interests that may conflict with international norms and standards . Adversaries may be able to influence international standards and standards.

 An Alternative Paradigm for United States Military Strategy . 12. 1 unwilling or unable to challenge the U.S. and her allies directly .
 To achieve their interests in a specific geographic area, adversaries will use a variety of diplomatic, information, military, and economic methods below levels .
Over time, these methods can neutralize America’s strengths and exhaust its political will . Over time, they can be used to neutralize the country's strengths, say experts .
 Social Movement Theory is an increasingly popular concept for analyzing insurgencies . It can help illuminate an adversary's strategic objectives and vulnerabilities .
 SMT’s tripartite approach of ideological framing, resource mobilization, and political opportunity is a useful method for a combatant command to understand an adversary's motivations, tendencies, and vulnerabilities . SMT's tripartites include ideological framing and resource mobilization .
 SMT can identify existing sources of tension in an adversary, likely vulnerabilities in a target region, and potential countermeasures for senior strategists and commanders . This paper demonstrates how SMT could identify existing source of tension.
 Chapter 1 reviews existing gray zone authors and literature, as well as introduce the Gray Zone SMT model of analysis . Chapter 1 also reviews existing grey zone authors, literature .
 Chapter 2 discusses Russia, which the U.S. considers its most active and dangerous adversary . The United States currently considers Russia the most active adversary .
 Chapter 4 concludes the paper with policy and authority recommendations for senior U.S. strategists and leaders . The paper also offers policy and Authority recommendations for strategists, leaders .
 The following literature and theory discussion has four main areas. LITERATURE and Theory DISCUSSION is the main discussion .
First, it will review the authorship background within the current body of literature . First, it'll review the writers' background in current literature .
 The third area will cover common themes of current gray zone literature, and introduce social movement theory . The third section will also introduce social movements theory .
 Often, gray zone academics are former military officers who earned terminal degrees after their service . Often, grey zone academics were former soldiers who had terminal degrees .
This set of authors tend to focus on theoretical aspects of gray zone strategy . This set of author's work focuses on the theoretical aspect of gray zones .
 The authors work diligently to link theory and application to their military experiences .
 They are the primary authors behind the major books and monographs on the gray zone . They are also the main authors behind major books, monographs and books on the grey zone .
 Antulio Echevarria, in Operating in the Gray Zone, takes a hard look at the strategy and tactics of the operation .
 Regaining Strategic Initiative in the Gray Zone, writes on how the gray zone generates paralysis in United States policy makers .
 Understanding a Changing Era of Conflict, explains how gray zone strategies shift the initiative to the weaker party .
 These authors, while hailing from across the armed services, have a sizable presence in the special operations community . The authors, who have a large presence in special operations, are from the armed forces .
 Senior commanders and staff officers dominate the practical side of gray zone analysis . Younger officers contribute as well as younger officers .
 practitioners focus on finding effective tactical and strategic responses to adversarial actions . They also reflect on the human aspects of modern warfare .
 Practitioners are on the front lines of the gray zone, and use those experiences to enhance the field of study . Special operators, especially special operators, can use the experience to enhance their knowledge .
 Operational requirements limit practitioner input to articles in newspapers and professional journals . Unfortunately, operational requirements limit practitioners' input to publications .
 The extensive writings in the online community exceed the scope of this literature review . The extensive writing in the internet community exceeds this review .
 Many academics and practitioners are active 2 United States Special Operations Command . The command is a noted home for several practitioners .
 Admiral Eric Olsen published articles in The Wall Street Journal and Defense One explaining the gray zone in common language .
 General Joseph Votel described unconventional warfare and the gray zone in JFQ 80 . He was a former SOCOM commander .
 Former commander of Army Special Operations Command describes how working by, with, and through indigenous population over time can neutralize a gray zone strategist .
 "Project Gray" and "Small Wars Journal" publish academic papers on the topic . It is important to recognize the community’s influence on gray zone research .
 The largest body of work focuses on finding strategic and tactical solutions to specific crises . The largestBody of work is focused on finding strategies and solutions for crises .
 Practitioners often explore the conditions that lead to the emergence of both gray zone areas and adversarial gray zone strategies .
 Practitioners also look internally at their own talent management systems to address the problem of the gray zone .
 A small number of authors use coercion and deterrence theory to explain gray zone problems . The theory is used to explain grey zone problems.
 Strategy and tactics writers emphasize plans either to solve existing specific gray zone challenges, or to address an emerging adversary . Strategy and Tactics writers emphasize plan to solve specific gray zones challenges .
Special operations community exerts particular influence in the special operations community . Special operations community is to reinforce foreign allies in solving their own problems .
 Echevarria, in Operating in the Gray Zone, states a whole-of-government approach is necessary . The military, with its experience with practical planning, should be the planners, leaders, and executors .
 DoD should “lead up in the interagency and develop strategic approaches to gray zone adversaries and challenges. Freier, in Outplayed, states should ‘lead up’
 CAPT Phillip Kapusta counters that America follows a predictable and overly militarized strategy . He says it's easy for gray zone adversary to counter .
Interagency approach can lead to long-term success against a gray adversary. Christopher Lamb, in “Back to Basics on Hybrid Warfare,” uses a Bosnia case study to demonstrate how an interagency approach could lead to success .
 success in the gray zone depends on partnerships with the indigenous population . The Emerging Land Commons and Gray Zone Conflict states that success depends on partnership with indigenous people .
 Echevarria and Kapusta are among the strongest in the field . Within strategy, the works of the two are the strongest, according to experts .
 The authors’ work are a firm foundation for additional strategic case study analysis .
 There is little emphasis on the application of diplomacy and economic measures, and there is little documentation of interagency activities within gray zone conflict areas .
 The Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, and others have no relevant examples in their gray zone approaches . It does not seem plausible that the Department of State and Treasury have no specific examples of such approaches .
 Practitioners pursue solutions to gray zone problems, place special emphasis on talent management and the human domain .
 Talent management maximizes a unit’s capability by finding, training, and employing the right person, to the right mission, at the right time .
 Understanding the human domain, in comparison, requires a micro-focus study on the populace in a crisis area . A micro-focused study is needed on the people in the crisis area.
 Complex problems require high levels of talent, capability, and maturity to provide effective solutions . Complex problems, such as gray zone challenges, require high level of talent and maturity .
 Talent management and the Human Domain present an interesting gray zone focus . The Human Domain presents an interesting grey zone focus on talent management .
Few U.S. government agencies apply it to addressing gray zone problems . While talent management is a universal concept, few government agencies are applying it to gray zone issues .
 The Special Operations Community places exceptional emphasis on talent management . Within Special Operations, talent management is the most important part of the community .
 General Votel, in Unconventional Warfare in the Gray Zone, describes how the WWII era Jedburgh teams required language and cultural proficiency, as well as high levels of maturity .
 Admiral William McRaven’s book, Spec Ops, emphasized the importance of proper talent in the conduct of special operations missions .
 The Bosnian Train and Equip program trained over 5,000 Bosniak Soldiers in two years . 6 manifests itself organically through rigorous assessment, selection, and training programs .
 Other interagency organizations should apply these concepts to their own recruiting, retention, and training efforts to tackle gray zone problems . Other inter agencies should apply this concept to their recruiting and retention efforts .
 As for the human domain, better interagency coordination and communication will help to draw a more concise picture of the operating environment .
 Lamb's case study provides a useful long-term perspective on the human domain in a successful gray zone campaign . Lamb’s case study provided a usefulLong-term view on the Human domain in the gray zone .
 The persistent nature of uncertain conflict attracts some writers to the foundational causes and conditions behind gray zone conflicts .
 An adversary will maintain focus on its domestic interests, with little concern for international norms and standards . A principal observation is that an adversary will focus on domestic interests .
 Once the adversary chooses to act, it will use ambiguous legal and moral means to “secure its objectives’s objectives while minimizing the scope and scale of actual combat” against a foe with superior resources and firepower .
 Both sides must weigh the risks of action over inaction, says author . This realist perspective is valuable because both sides must keep their domestic audiences in mind .
Clear national security priorities will determine the actions of both the adversary and its foreign competitors . Clear national security priority is to protect the U.S. national security.
 The U.S. suffers from strategic paralysis in gray zone crises because it has weighed domestic support against the uncertainty of foreign conflict . Freier, in Outplayed, took a hard look at how the United States suffers.
 Henry Kissinger used a similar analysis to explain how Chairman Mao would address multiple small conflicts along China’s borders .
 A gray zone strategist will use small actions to blur the line between peace and war . The other side will either break the peace or accept the new action as a permanent change to the status quo .
 There are few in-depth works from academics, and general articles merely skim the surface for policy makers .
 The U.S. has diplomatic archives and cables that are available for analysis and study . The United States lacks a diplomatic presence in many countries .
 A thorough study of these data sources can provide useful information to academics, practitioners, and policy makers .
 Once a critical aspect of Cold War politics, adversaries now use deterrence as a more subtle means of settling disputes . "Deterioration" is now more subtle way to settle disputes .
 By threatening possible opponents with the high costs of intervention, adversaries can amass resources, synchronize communications between allies, and secure their objectives without overt violence .
 Kissinger proposed using little wars to deter China and Russia from committing to resource-intensive land wars . Kissinger, in “Military Policy and Defense of the Gray Areas,’s” proposal was proposed by Kissinger .
 Echevarria: All aspects of military power, as well as finance, intelligence, and the law, are viable tools for a gray zone adversary . The law, finance and intelligence are also viable tools, he said .
Deterrence and coercion have real promise of explaining gray zone problems . But deterrence and coercion has real promise, according to experts .
 This concept demands more research and study by both academics and practitioners . The richness of the theoretical material, and the ability to apply theory to existing and former gray zone crises, is the key .
 academics and practitioners are aggressively tackling the different aspects of gray zone research . United by a common concern over America’s strategic shortfalls, academics are aggressive .
 An aspiring researcher on the gray zone will find a wealth of information and knowledge as a starting point .
 Recognizing this commonality better frames the gray zone problem and leads to better analysis . Recognizing the commonality of gray zone problems is a good way to identify the problem .
 The first, and most common theme, is that that all instruments of national power are necessary for success .
 Adversaries are militarily weaker than the United States, so they cannot afford a direct military confrontation . The U.S. is less likely to be involved in a direct confrontation with its adversaries .
 adversaries use information, economics, diplomacy, and legal avenues to achieve their objectives . Instead, adept adversaries useInformation, economics and diplomacy to achieve objectives .
 The United States, within its legal and moral traditions, must reply in kind . The U.S. must respond in kind, according to the United States .
 The U.S. cannot win gray zone conflicts by using only one department or agency of government. The second common theme is that the United States cannot win grey zone conflicts with only one agency or department .
Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational is the ideal construct for fighting 9 adversaries . Joint, Inter agency, Inter governmental, andMultinational is an ideal construct .
 Each department, service, and partner nation has unique skills and abilities . Each department has a unique skill and ability .
 When JIIM partners are working in concert, there is a much greater chance for success . However, when J IIM partners work in concert there is an greater chance of success .
 The gray zone is not ahistorical, according to the authors . The authors proved that the gray zone was not a historical .
 The historical nature of gray zone conflict validates the use of historical case studies for comprehending and analyzing modern examples .
 C Gray Zone Conflicts and Social Movement Theory concludes that an adversary desires political control over a target population and will use multiple methods to achieve that goal .
More importantly, gray zone methods refrain from overt violence to avoid negative reactions from the international community . More importantly, stop overt violence from being overt violence .
 Ideally, a successful adversary will achieve its goal through voluntary support of the target population . The goal is to achieve its target population by voluntary support .
 No one has applied social movement theory towards understanding gray zone conflicts . With voluntary popular support as a principle objective, it is interesting that no one has used social movement theories to understand gray zones conflicts .
 Social Movement Theory emerged in the 1960s as U.S. and European governments tried to understand the changes emerging in their societies .
 Marxism and political repression theory failed to explain the rise of these new 15 Kapusta, The Gray Zone, 24 .
 The social movement approach to understand the American Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam protest movement, and other forms of political protest. An Alternative Paradigm for U.S. Military Strategy, 6. 10 movements, landed on the Social movement approach .
 SMT has become a valuable tool in understanding ideological insurgencies around the world . Since the 1960s, SMT is used to help understand ideological insurgencyencies around world .
 In the early years of the 21st Century, academics and practitioners began using SMT to analyze the Islamist movements across the Middle East .
 The Contribution of Social Movement Theory to Understanding Terrorism is called Sociology Compass 5, no. 1567 . Colin J Beck's "Sociology Compass" was published in 2005 .
 Hafez: Rise of violent Islamist movements since the 1950s was result of an existing political system that failed to care for its people . Hafez said that rise of violent Islamic movements was the result of a failed political system .
 Neither material wealth nor moderation could squelch the rise of political violence by disaffected Islamists, says the author .
 Hafez’s use of SMT was a significant advance in the study of Islamist insurgencies, says Hafez . Hafez's use ofSMT was an advance in study of Islamic insurgency.
 Hafez is one of the most prominent authors on SMT and Islamist insurgencies . Hafez was not the first scholar to make this connection .
 Islamists use social interactions to provide for the population, recruit followers, and propagate their ideology . Quintan Wiktorowicz described how Islamists use their social interactions.
 Asef Bayat argues that the “imagined solidarity’ of a social movement is the best way to explain how Islamism makes constant political adjustments without losing popularity .
 Repression and Resistance in the Islamic World (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2004), 19.
 The lack of SMT application to the gray zone is interesting, but not surprising, is the lack of application to SMT .
 The United States has spent a large amount of time, blood, and treasure fighting Islamic insurgencies across the Middle East and around the world .
 SMT scholars would focus their efforts on Islamic insurgencies instead of other conflict areas . It follows that SMT scholar would focus on Islamic insurgency instead of conflict areas.
 Gray Zone Analytical Tool using SMT’s Tripartite Model . ‘Hamas as a Social Movement’
The secondary population consists of the near abroad, or the adversary’s primary target . The secondary population is of theNear abroad .
 The third target audience is the opponent, also known as the Far Enemy . The Far Enemy is known as "Far Enemy" and "The Far Enemy"
 The Far Enemy is more powerful than the adversary, and can greatly influence the adversary’s desired end state . The adversary can influence the end state of the adversary .
 It is critical to remember that the national power references apply to the adversary, not the United States or the targeted state .
 Adversaries tend to use a different mix of national power elements for each aspect of the tripartite model .
 The third consideration of the SMT model is sequencing the three aspects of the tripartite model . The three aspects are sequencing the third aspect of the Tripartite.
 Ideological framing and resource mobilization are long-term campaigns, often subtle or covert, that can last months or years with few signs to outside observers .
 Political opportunities, on the other hand, are singular events that fundamentally alter the status quo in the conflict region . Political opportunities are singular.
 This method of population analysis stems from the Target Audience Analysis process within Psychological Operations . Successful adversaries, through ideological framing and 26, can be used to determine who is a successful adversary .
 TTPs behind PSYOP TAA are classified, but the basic concepts are common to marketing, business, and communications strategies . PSYop TAA is one of the most successful marketing and business strategies .
 A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War, 352. 14 resource mobilization, will exert steady pressure on their targets to accelerate and exploit the political opportunity .
 An adversary uses mass social movements to create political change in a target region . Under this perspective, the preceding SMT Gray Zone model should look at how an adversary uses social movements.
 This critique is valid, but also constraining, because it focuses on simply stopping or controlling the social movement . The solution is to simply stop or control the movement .
 The author proposes using the tripartite model as a different reference point on gray zone problems . Instead, the author proposes a different set of solutions to the gray zone problem .
 The weaponization of mass social movements goes beyond the scope of this paper . The concept is a fascinating concept for future study .
 This case study uses SMT’s tripartite structure to understand the Russian political state and domestic population . The study is based on a study of Russian political and domestic populations .
 Russian leaders depend on strong foreign policy actions to maintain internal political support . Russian leaders use the West as a comparison to the West .
 The West failed to recognize the political opportunity to influence Russian political behavior in the 1990s . In 1999, the West reopening the door for authoritarian rule in Russia .
Strong Leadership Ensures Domestic Stability History forms the first ideological frame for how the Russian people perceive their government . Strong Leadership Ensured Domestic stability History forms a first ideological Frame .
 Under this particular governing model, political weakness is a sure path to personal destruction, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The Russians czars and Soviet premiers, in their foreign relations, placed great emphasis on appearing strong on the international stage . The Russian czars had a strong presence on the world stage .
 This image of international prestige bolstered their domestic image . In turn, this image of national prestige bolstered the country's image . This image was seen as a boost to their image.
 When Russian leaders lose the aura of power and prestige, the loss of political power comes rather quickly .
 Russia's international standing is important because it is directly proportional to the government's domestic support . Russia’s international stand is important, according to the Russian government .
 There is little precedent for either earning or maintaining a social contract . As the country has a long history of authoritarian control, there is no precedent for such a contract .
 This missing social contract contributes to Russia’s “legal nihilism,’ or disrespect for the law, by the common citizen, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: Russia's "legal nihilist" contributes to the country's ‘
 Dmitry Shlapentokh states, “The chronic inability of the state to collect taxes is a sign of the lack of respect for the law in Russian culture.
Social contract modern Westerners willingly obey has never existed in Russia . It is an indication that the social contract modern westerners willingly obeying has never been in Russia.
 Throughout Russia's history, Russia compared and measured its power against European countries . Russia's power has been measured against European nations .
 After the end of World War II, the U.S. became the standard for Russian success .
 The Soviet Union spent over 40 years competing with the U.S. economically, militarily, diplomatically, and politically . Starting in 1948, the Soviet Union began competing economically, economically, and diplomatically .
 This Cold War rivalry gave Russia more international standing and prestige than at any other time in its history . The Cold War was the most intense rivalry between Russia and Russia .
 Russia uses all four elements of national power to earn international influence and maintain domestic support . Russia's oil and natural gas resources are a key source of strength .
 Russia is the world’s largest producer of crude oil . It is second only to the United States in natural gas production .
 Russia uses both of these resources effectively to target neighboring states through market manipulation and supply controls . Russia also uses both the resources and control control of the market to manipulate neighboring states .
 Russia solidified bilateral trade relationships with neighboring countries across Europe and Central Asia . Instead, Russia used its energy resources as a leverage point, instead of using them as leverage .
 Russia's diplomatic and economic synergy gave Russia an asymmetric advantage over its trading partners . Over time, this diplomatic andEconomic synergy gave the country an advantage over other countries .
 If a trading partner took a political path that was hostile to Russian interests, then Russia would use economic disincentives, such as excise duties, to change the partner’s political behavior .
 Russia also used economic relationships to enhance its diplomatic power . Russia also use economic relationships as a way to enhance diplomatic power.
 Russia's use of bilateral relationships not only helped it to dominate partners, but also weakened international resolve . Russia’s use of its bilateral relationships has helped it dominate partners .
 During a crisis, countries had to choose between the potential benefits of allying the West or the tangible economic lifeline from Russia . The West had to decide between the benefits and the tangible benefits of Russia .
 This emphasis on bilateral relationships also reinforced Russian strength in geographic areas that the West neglected, such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia . This emphasis also reinforced Russia's strength in the region .
 Albert O Hirschman’s defined this relationship in his Economic Dependence model . The relationship is based on his economic Dependence Model .
 This is a condition where an asymmetric economic relationship between two states has political consequences . This is the condition where the relationship between the two states is asymmetric. This is where the political consequences of the relationship have political consequences.
 The larger state uses its economic interests to define its national interests, thereby affecting the foreign policy of the smaller state . The smaller state's economic interests are used by the larger state .
 Throughout the 1990s, Russian diplomats successfully protected the country's interests by isolating foreign policy from domestic turmoil .
 Russian diplomats were proactive in several significant global decisions, often at odds with the U.S.
 Russia's actions showed defiance in the face of “American hegemony,’s actions, helped Russia to maintain the image of a great power on the international stage .
 Russia could exploit its diplomatic and economic power because Europe and the U.S. did not sustain their focus on the countries along Russia’s frontier .
 The EU only implemented policies in Eastern Europe if they did not conflict with Moscow’s security interests . The EU is trying to bring Russia's interests into closer alignment with the West .
 Over time, this approach created the impression to Russia that the EU would not interfere in its “sphere of influence’s” and sow the seeds for future conflict .
 The West accepted Russia’s “sphere of influence’ was its military power . A major reason that the West tacitly accepted Russia's ‘sphere’ of influence was itsMilitary power .
 The post-Cold-War Russian military fell from the world’s second largest to fifth . It was still the most powerful force in Eastern Europe and Central Asia .
 Russia’s conventional military consists of elite and regular forces numbering 14 Allen C Lynch, "The Realism of Russia's Foreign Policy" Europe-Asia Studies Studies 53, no. 53, is no. 3 .
 Russia's irregular warfare component consists of special forces and militias that can conduct special operations in domestic and international roles . Russia’s irregular warfare part consists of Special Forces and militias .
 Russia maintains the world’s largest nuclear arsenal with over 80,000 personnel . Russia maintains a strong deterrent to Western military adventurism .
Russia maintains control through dominating the media environment . Russia maintains control of the media through dominating its media environment.
 Domestic support depends heavily on international prestige. As stated earlier, domestic support depends on international support .
 After the Cold War, the government required an adversary, and the “democratic peace movement from Europe and the United States provided the perfect scapegoat’s scapegoat .
 The sharp rise of democratization, followed by aggressive NATO expansion in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, appeared to be a direct threat to Russian security .
 The Image of Weak Leadership Brings a Return To Autocracy Russian leadership began to show signs of weakness in the late 1980s .
 Gorbachev recognized that Russia lacked a just social contract with the people . Russia had the outward appearances of economic, military, and political strength .
 After the Soviet Union fell in 1991, Russia’s international prestige took a precipitous drop .
 The U.S. and the West had the opportunity to reinforce Yeltsin's domestic image . The United States, the West and the United States had the chance to reinforce the country's image .
 NATO expansion and rejection of Russia's entry to the G-7 community undermined Yeltsin’s political power. Unfortunately, NATO expansion was not successful, according to CNN .
 In the 23 Leon Aron, "Everything You Think You Know about the Collapse of the Soviet Union is wrong," he writes . "Foreign Policy, no. , 67. .
 Putin's "propaganda leitmotifs of ‘hostile encirclement’ and ‘Russia rising off its knees’ resonated with the populace, and led to his election in 2000 .
 SMT Analysis of Russia’s Domestic Environment In the model, Russia targets two populations . Russia targets the two populations of two populations.
 The government cannot successfully pursue any objectives outside of its borders . Without domestic support, the government can't successfully succeed .
 The other target population are Western governments, which serve as both partners and rivals in international relations .
 Centuries of czarist rule, followed by almost 80 years of communist dominance, left a legacy of autocratic rule .
 Russian history repeatedly shows that the people respect strong leaders, while viewing weak leaders as a significant threat .
 The Russian political system requires strong leadership to maintain domestic stability . With no viable social contract between the government and the people, the political system needs strong leadership .
 In an autocratic environment, a strong leader requires an adversary or competitor . A strong leader needs a competitor or competitor.
 For much of Russia’s history, Western European powers served as the model for comparison . Russia's history has served as a model for comparisons with Europe .
 After World War II, the United States ably filled this role, and Russia’s international prestige grew during the Cold War .
 This gave Russian leaders the strength and authority they needed to run the country despite significant domestic concerns . This gave them the strength to run their country despite major domestic concerns.
 Ideology and competition are not enough; strong leaders need resources to maintain power . Strong leaders needresources to maintain control of power, say experts .
 Russia’s power flows from its vast oil and natural gas reserves, which it exports to countries across Europe and Central Asia .
 Russian diplomats emphasize bilateral trade relationships, where Russia can maintain an asymmetric advantage over a weaker neighbor .
 Russia possesses the strongest military in Eastern Europe, and can easily dominate any of its neighbors . Russia also possesses the strong military in the region .
 The Russian government controls the media environment, ensuring that the majority of the domestic population will only receive information that supports the regime .
 Human rights violations like silencing dissenters, imprisoning political rivals, 24 and assassinating journalists and critics fail to arouse the population because those actions never make the evening news broadcasts . Human rights abuses like silences dissenters and imprisoning politicians and critics never make news broadcasts.
 The only political opportunity for the West to change Russia’s political environment was the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The fall of Russia's Soviet Union was the only political chance to change the country's political environment .
 During the 1990s, the U.S. and the West could have reinforced President Boris Yeltsin’s political position . The United States and the west could have strengthened President Yeltsins' political position.
 The West rejected Yeltsin's G-7 request and accepted Russia’s neighbors as NATO allies . Instead, the West weakened his domestic position by rejecting his G- 7 request .
 Vladimir Putin replaced Yeltsin as president in 2000 . Putin has promised a return of Russian strength .
 Over the years, Putin regularly projected Russian strength on the international stage, which only increased his domestic approval ratings .
 The most likely method of exploiting Russia’s vulnerabilities as an adversary depend on eroding confidence in its leaders . Moving forward, the most likely way to exploit Russia's vulnerabilities will depend on its leaders' confidence .
 This will be an exceptionally difficult challenge, especially in Russia’s hostile information environment, says CNN's John Sutter . "This will be a difficult challenge," he says .
 Diplomatic and economic efforts appear less likely to work, as neither have a direct impact on the average Russian citizen .
 Russia remains a tier below NATO and the U.S. and is incapable of invading Western Europe . Militarily, Russia is a tier above NATO and is not a major threat to the West .
 Russia has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, and enough conventional military power to deter Western forces . However, Russia has enough conventional power to defend itself from the West .
Russia remains in a demographic spiral, with an overall life expectancy lower than Bangladesh, Eritrea, and Yemen . Russia remains in the demographic spiral.
 Russia faces an uncertain economic future, as the price for a barrel of oil fell from $146.69 in July 2008 to $50 a barrel in 2017 .
 The expanding information environment, especially in social media, makes Soviet-style repression tactics impossible to conceal from the international community . Finally, the expanding media environment makes the situation difficult to hide from the world .
Standing firm on vital interests, while remaining alert to indirect approaches, appears to be the best way to contain this wily adversary . Standing firm on important interests and remaining alert is the best approach .
 In 2014, Russia executed a series of overtly aggressive actions against Ukraine . Russia executed an overtly aggressive action against Ukraine.
 Russian forces seized political and military centers of power in the Crimean peninsula in February . In February, Russian forces took control of the Crimea peninsula .
 Moscow annexed Crimea into greater Russia after a “peoples’ referendum,’s referendum .
 The following summer, Russian special forces fomented an insurgency in the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts of eastern Ukraine . The following year, Russian Special Forces foments an insurgency.
 The insurgents formed the Luhansk and Donetsk Peoples’ Republics, and requested to join Russia . The insurgents were formed by rebels in the LuHansk and the Donetsk Peoples' Republics .
 Only the July 17 shoot down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Donetsk prevented another Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory . The July 17 shooting down of MH17 over Donetsk prevents another Russian annexing Ukrainian territory.
 Russian actions in 2014 were the culmination of a long-term, subtle, and persistent strategy for Moscow to exert political control over Ukraine . Russia's actions were the result of an effort to exert power over Ukraine.
Until the Crimean annexation in February, Russia successfully executed its strategy without incurring a significant response from the U.S. or Europe . Until the annexation, Russia did not receive significant response.
 SMT analysis helps to answer several important questions with respect to Russia and Ukraine .
 Russia forced Ukraine to accept an asymmetric bilateral relationship with Russia . Russia's economic, diplomatic, and military power made Ukraine accept the relationship .
 Russia took advantage of the political opportunity to seize Crimea and sow chaos in eastern Ukraine . The Maidan uprising in the winter of 2013-2014 overthrew Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovich .
 The relationship between Russia and Ukraine reaches back to the 9th Century AD, during the founding of the empire of Kievan Rus .
 Kievan Rus is the common ancestor of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus . Kiev is the “mother of Russian cities’s’.
 The Golden Horde of Baku Khan destroyed it in the 13th Century . The empire thrived until the Golden Horde was destroyed in 13th century .
After the Mongols left the region in the 15th Century, outside entities would continue to control Ukraine . The Mongols would remain in the region until the end of the century .
After a short period in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian czars conquered eastern Ukraine and absorbed it into the greater Russian Empire .
