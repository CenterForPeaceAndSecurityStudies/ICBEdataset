 Putin continues to advance further threats to the Ukraine through his sponsored military conflict in Eastern Ukraine . Putin celebrates the annexation of Crimea into Russia in 2014 .
 Russian troops began their attack on the Ukraine in February 2014 . The attack left most of Eastern Ukraine in the hands of Â separatists and Russian soldiers . It ostensibly created independent separatist states in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts .
 Each day the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission reports of battles between Ukrainian and Russian-sponsored troops in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions .
 Between 2014 and 2018, this military conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists continued in eastern Ukraine . More than 10,000 people have been killed and thousands displaced in the conflict .
 Ukraine says it has violated Russian waters . It placed a freighter to block the port, saying the Ukraine has violated Russia's waters .
Relations between Russia and Ukraine have been violated by the Russians at almost every opportunity . As the conflicts continue, treaties and protocols which had been agreed to regulate the relations between the two countries have been broken .

 Gorbachev had prepared a treaty recognising the breakup of the USSR into autonomous republics . But he was prevented from signing the treaty by the attempted coup against him in August of 1991 .
 On August 24, 1991 the coup had failed and Kravchuk, the head of the Ukrainian parliament, passed a motion declaring the independence of the Ukraine with him as its first leader .
 The U.S. primary concern was strategic; the control of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons . The primary concern is strategic; it was strategic .

 In a private letter to Clinton, Kravchuk promised that Ukraine would be nuclear free by June 1996 .
 Kiev finally settled their dispute over the Black Sea Fleet . Prime Ministers Chernomyrdin and Lazarenko signed three intergovernmental agreements .
 The two sides agreed to divide the fleet's assets and to lease port facilities in Sevastopol to the Russian Navy . The Russian Navy will lease the port facilities to the fleet .
 Under the agreement the two nations split the fleet's ships evenly . Russia agreed to buy back some of the more modern ships with cash .
 Russia ultimately received four-fifths of the Black Sea Fleet's warships . Ukraine received about half of the facilities, while Russia got about half .
 Russian Black Sea Fleet warships dropped anchor off the Georgian coast during and after the August 2008 Russian armed conflict with Georgia over Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
 Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko announced that Ukraine would not extend the lease of Sevastopol base beyond 2017 . He urged the Russian fleet to start preparations for a withdrawal .
 The war in Georgia was supported by NATO and the European Union . The threat by Ukrainians that Russia would lose its warm-water naval bases in Crimea provoked the Russians to retaliate against both the Ukrainians and the EU .

 The U.S. supported the Ukrainians in their defiance of the Russian threats . Europeans pressed for some sort of a compromise which would let the gas flow to their countries .
 The Europeans were desperate for the Ukrainians to do whatever it took to assuage the Russian gas threat . U.S. and its NATO allies pressed the Ukrainians on ending the Russian leases which allowed them a presence in the Black Sea .
 Russian gas was no substitute at that time for Russian gas so a compromise would have to be reached with the Russians . Despite the arguments brought forward in favour of each of these policies, a realistic assessment of the situation was made .
 Ukrainian and Russian parliaments ratified a deal to extend the lease on the Russian naval bases in the Ukraine for 25 years . The current current lease expired in 2017 .
 The Europeans then began an accelerated process to bring the government of the Ukraine under its wing and control . It could prevent further confrontations on the transport of gas .
 Ukraine was not very interested at that time in joining NATO . But it was interested in establishing a relationship within the aegis of the European Union .
 Tymoshenko met with the European Union under the terms of the European Neighbourhood Policy . The policy aimed to create a ring of friendly states allied but not members of the EU .

 The EU put the accession of Ukraine on hold until Yanukovych freed Tymoshenko . The Rada decided that before they would sign there should be a three-way trade agreement which included Russia to prevent a crisis with the Russians .
 Yanukovych refused to sign the agreement with the EU because his supporters, primarily in his Eastern heartland, were bitterly opposed to the terms of the EU accession .
 Violence intensified. Violence intensified and there were shootings and beatings on all sides .
On February 21 after negotiations between the president Yanukovych and representatives of the opposition and with mediation of representatives of European Union and Russia the Agreement was signed .
 The protestors and the U.S. government insisted on further concessions and the resignation of the President . However, this seemed generally acceptable as a compromise .
 The President felt that his time was up and that civil war was looming . Later that day, he felt that he was in the midst of a civil war .
 The Rada met the next day to impeach Yanukovych for being unable to perform his duties . Yanukovych was impeach by the Rada for not performing duties .
