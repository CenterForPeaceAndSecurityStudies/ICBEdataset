 The Social Identity Theory analyses the evolution of the EU’s SP approach towards the eastern neighbours and the development of the European identity .
 The EU's relationship with Russia and not Ukraine has accumulated the discursive markers of a strategic partnership . It demonstrates how the process of categorization relating to the ideational ‘self’, ‘we’ and ‘other’ took place .
 The contribution, furthermore, analyses the challenges to the EU changing approach stemming from the 2013–2014 Ukraine crisis . The contribution is also analyzed by the European Commission .
 The present contribution explores the changing relationship between the European Union and the two largest countries in its eastern neighbourhood, namely Ukraine and Russia, between 1991 and 2014 .
 SIT considers agents to be driven by the inherent desire to maximize their own self-esteem . It is only possible in social relationships/participation in significant groups .
 The EU’s SP approach towards its eastern neighbours is a process of refocusing the ‘self’, ‘we’ and ‘other’ on the other hand . The approach can be summarized as an analysis of the interrelationship between the evolution of
 Such a c­ omparative ­approach should also help to illuminate the specific characteristics of each r­ elationship . Also pointing out their differences.
 The contribution points to the evolution of two increasingly different interaction patterns corresponding to different EU identity categories . The contribution point to the development of two more different types of interaction patterns .
 The SP cooperation paradigm has not been in high demand in EU–Ukraine relations . As a result, the EU–Russia relationship is not a high demand for cooperation in Ukraine .
 The EU has rethought the SP as a suitable expression of the EU–Russia relationship . In addition, the contribution demonstrates how, following the contestation of the autonomy of theEU ‘potential we’ by Russia in the course of the Ukraine crisis, the
 The end of the Cold War created the need for both the European Community /EU and the Newly Independent States to define their international identity . SPs as means and channels of socialization.
 The EU was faced with a number of pressing issues and dilemmas, including how to design its relationship with the states to its east .
 Finding answers to these questions would inevitably impact upon the EU’s identity .
 The most significant process taking place in the 1990s was EU’s eastern enlargement . The NIS, including Ukraine and Russia, were not an immediate EU priority .
 The EU's initial approach to Russia and Ukraine was determined by promoter/socializer . This new facet of being a norm promoter/ socializer determined the EU’s initial approach .
 At the same time, the EU aimed at a specific categorization of most of the NIS, setting them apart from the CEES and the Baltics .
 The PCA stipulated the creation of a multilevel political dialogue aiming at involve consultations at the highest political level . It also stipulated new prospects of cooperation in cultural, educational, scientific, scientific and technological fields .
 The institutional infrastructure of the dialogue consisted of the high-level summits of presidents/ heads of government . The Cooperation Council, the Cooperation Committee, the regular meetings of subcommittees, and the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
 SP recognition disappeared when the socializees failed to move forward according to expectations of the socializer .
 The EU ‘self’ defined as socializer of the countries to its east, but these countries agreed with this facet of the EU 'self' as a central feature of their SPs .
 The growing international ambitions of the EU were reinforced by the evolution of the CFSP . The creation of the European Security and Defence Policy and the emergence of the external dimension of the Justice and Home Affairs .
 The PCAs were ratified by Russia in December 1997, and Ukraine in July 1998 . These changes coincided with the entry into force of the PCAs with Russia, and with Ukraine .
 The EU adopted two more instruments reaffirming the importance of Russia and Ukraine, namely the CSs .
Both Russia and Ukraine were assigned special importance by the EU . The EU also assigns special importance to the NIS states, but also to third countries .
 The EU SP approach seemed to be underpinned by a specific geographic rationale, namely a focus on the EU’s periphery . The special interest in Russia and Ukraine was related to their position as direct neighbours of the EU .
 CSs were expected to operationalize the CFSP, having high expectations attached to them in terms of improving the EU's foreign policy .
 CSs did represent a potentially important adjustment of the EU SP approach . CSs represent an important adjustment to the EU's approach to the European Union .
 The eventual ‘modelling’ of the CSU on the CSR, in structure and sometimes with exactly the same wording, should be understood in these terms .
 The EU's importance as part of Russia’s ‘generalized we’ was not contested. Nevertheless, the EU’'s importance was not disputed .
 The SP maintained an emphasis on the socialization of partners into a 'generalized we' The SP also stressed the importance of common values and norm promotion .
 Ukraine and Russia have been given room for their own interpretation of the new EU approach . The twofold nature of the SP, combining a distinction of both countries by means of stronger political and security dialogue, offered Ukraine and Russian room for its own interpretation .
 The CSR was interpreted as an indicator of a changing interaction pattern determined by more horizontal elements in contrast to the previously asymmetrical relationship in Russia .
 The Energy Dialogue was launched at the Paris EU–Russia summit in 2000 . It was aimed at facilitating the trade and investment flows between the EU and Russia in the energy sector .
 The document also allowed for the possibility of EU/WEU (Western European Union) operations . The document was also allowed to allow EU/ WEU operations .
 Ukraine's recognition of Ukraine on the EU’S SP radar did not impress Kiev . In the absence of the desired candidate status, Ukraine was not considered a candidate .
 Ukraine’s subsequent strategy consisted in acting against such possible categorization, by putting forward initiatives of a closer rapprochement, in the spirit of the Strategy on Ukraine's Integration with the European Union, adopted in 1998 .
 The EU's adoption of the CSs corresponded to its aspiration to change the interaction pattern with both Russia and Ukraine . The EU’s adoption of CSs corresponds to its aspirations to changing the interaction patterns.
 Ukraine and Russia were intended to be achieved by means of a positive differentiation between the two countries, on the one hand, and on the other hand . The latter was intended to achieve a positive difference between Ukraine and Russian .
 The emergence of the ENP can be regarded as another instance of the EU defining a new identity dimension as a basis for redefining its interaction with its partners .
 Maintaining positive influence over the countries in its direct proximity was also in line with the EU’s post-enlargement aspirations to affirm itself as a strong international actor .
 The EU aimed to maintain and indeed reinforce the interaction pattern based upon socialization of its partners . On the other hand, recognizing its role as its neighbours’ ‘significant we'
 The ENP maintained most of enlargement’s operational instruments and mechanisms, including the political conditionality principle . The EU partners’ approximation to European values and their adoption of the acquis communautaire.
 Russia withdrew from the ENP after being initially included in the initiative . Russia withdrew in its early stages of the initiative in the early stages .
 The launch of the Common Spaces worked towards further consolidation of the change in EU–Russia relations, away from the EU as Russia's ‘generalized we’ and towards ‘self–other’ interaction .
 Russia’s Chechnya problem to be presented in a new light. This tendency was reinforced by the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and subsequent rapprochement of Russia with the United States .
 The emergence of the Common Spaces, underpinned by ‘self–other’ interaction, not only defined the EU–Russia SP as a non-ENP relationship, but also led to the categorization of the ENP as ‘something that an SP was not’
 Ukrainian leadership was enthusiastic about the EU 'potential we’ categorization as an ultimate basis for the relationship. This is not to say that the Ukrainian leaders were enthusiastic about EU categorization .
 The CS, the ENP and the AA all shared a compensatory logic and represented temporary solutions . Indeed, viewed from Kiev, the CS and the ANP all shared the same logic .
 Ukrainian leadership accepted the ENP as the best available fit to Ukraine’s ‘prospective we’ aspirations .
 Kiev's embracement of the ENP in spite of the fact that Ukraine could not influence the design or content of the initiative . The transfer of norms and values was stipulated to occur in an asymmetric and non-negotiable manner . This explains Kiev�
 The EaP and Russia’s emerging challenge to the EU ‘potential we’ In 2009, the ENP was complemented by the EAP .
 The EaP was designed for six eastern ENP states, thereby excluding Russia . Supported especially by CEES and the Baltics, the Ea P was designed to be supported by the European Union .
 The EaP sought to reinforce the ‘potential we’ as a distinctive EU foreign policy identity category, with AA and DCFTA as its sharper institutional expressions .
 Russia employed both sticks, such as threats of sanctions, tariffs and higher gas prices, to attract new members . To attract members, Russia offered loans and a natural gas discount offered to Ukraine .
 Moscow’s attempts to attract Ukraine to the Eurasian project have not changed Kiev's aspirations . Kiev's ‘prospective we’ aspirations are not changed, says Kiev .
 Ukraine's economic and energy dependence on Russia, such as Iran, has worsened its relations with Russia . Ukraine's relations with countries essential to Ukraine’s aspirations to offset its economic (and energy) dependence on Iran .
 A range of Ukraine's actions and declarations appeared to uphold the 'potential we' interaction pattern, as well as Ukraine’s ‘prospective we’ aspirations. Thus, and in spite of all well-documented setbacks in Ukraine's ‘EU-ization'
 Moscow’s insistence on a joint consultative body as the basis of its engagement with the ESDP . Also prevented the negotiation of a new agreement to replace the PCA, which expired in December 2007 .
 The price of gas would be reduced from over US$400 per 1000 cubic metres to US$268 . The EU expressed concern about Ukraine’s 6.6 Correspondingly, the price would be cut from over $400 to $268 .
 Ukraine is one of the first non-EU member states to join an EU battlegroup . Since July 2011, Ukrainian naval forces have been part of the Greek-led EU Balkan Battle Group .
 Ukraine renounces the ‘potential we’ as a basis for the relationship . Still, all these setbacks did not result in Ukraine renouncing the 'potential' they had .
 Continuity with the previously established course towards ‘we-doing’ was provided with the July 2010 gas law . The law was intended to create a legal framework for the introduction of a competitive gas market .
 Ukraine's interaction with the EU stood in contrast with Russia's as manifest in the latter’s contestation of the EU’'s emerging acquis communautaire and the Third Energy Package . The U-turn decision of Yanukovich at the 2013 Vilnius summit, resulting
 Ukraine's decision to halt approximation to EU norms would mean a fundamental revision of Ukraine’s ‘self’, ‘other’ and ‘significant we’ The AA was explicitly proscribed by Moscow, and under direct economic and political pressure .
 The costs of adopting and implementing the acquis communautaire were unconditionally accepted . This is not to say that membership in the EU or in the DCFTA suddenly became uncontested issues .
 The events in Ukraine were a reaction against the radical reorientation towards the Eurasian Union and the benefits to the Yanukovich regime .
 The European Council made signature of the AA contingent upon Ukraine complying with international standards of electoral practice, ending selective justice and implementing previously agreed reforms .
 The so-called ‘Füle List’ of 19 EU demands was expected to pave the way to the signature of the AA in 2013 . The AA is expected to be signed in 2013.
 The AA not only made further rapprochement with the EU less probable, it also opened a prospect of Russia consolidating itself as Ukraine’s ‘significant we’ The political regime of Viktor Yanukovich suddenly look like a bad imitation of Russia’
 The use of force against demonstrators between D ­ ecember 2013 and February 2014 resulted in the loss of the appeal of the Eurasian Union in terms of the positive identity of Ukraine as a potential in-group member . The Ukraine crisis would be further reinforced in the course of the Ukraine crisis
 The EU had to acknowledge the extent of Russia’s influence over the EaP states . It amounted to a ‘counter-conditionality’ of its own .
 EU b ­ acking the Euromaidan demonstrators. Support for its ‘potential we’ was provided by the EU .
 The EU also demonstrated flexibility while signing the political part of the AA with the Ukrainian interim government on 21 March 2014, only days after the annexation of Crimea .
 The EU–Russia interaction pattern remained unchanged, while EU’s efforts to sustain its ‘potential we’ were undermined .
 The extraordinary Council meeting convened on 3 March 2014 led to a number of decisions . The suspension of EU–Russia political dialogue and the introduction of sanctions against Russia .
 The unfolding Ukraine crisis challenged the EU ‘potential we’ on two accounts . The Ukraine crisis challenges the EU’s ability to work with the EU .
 Russia aimed to highlight the weakness of the EU as a military actor with a clearly defined strategy . Russia’s strategy was both well defined and successfully applied to a number of EaP countries .
 The Donbass uprisings broadened after 7 April . Turchinov responded with the launch of an antiterrorist operation on 15 April .
 The Odessa tragedy was followed by the declaration of independence of the Luhansk and Donetsk Republics on 11 May .
 EU sanctions against Russia-backed separatists, as well as Russian officials, and economic assistance to Ukraine. All these events hinted at the fact that the EU ‘potential we’ could hardly be managed by the instruments available to the EU, such as sanctions against
 The challenge became more pronounced with the failure of the Geneva Agreement and the kidnapping of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers in Slavyansk in April 2014 .
 The EU was underperforming in sustaining its ‘potential we’ in other ways, as well, according to the EU .
 The EU's modest and reactive response to the ongoing hostilities was met with disappointment . In particular the EU’s modest and proactive response was met by disappointment .
 49 people were killed in the downing of a Ukrainian Air Force transport aircraft IL-76 . Uninterrupted supply of arms from Russia to Ukraine has led to the death .
 The EU was not even prepared to change its position regarding the possibility of Ukraine being considered part of the EU ‘prospective we’ That is by bringing Ukraine any closer to prospective membership .
 The frustration in Kiev also grew as Germany’s growing impetus in the peace talks . In 2014, the EU promised Ukraine €11 billion over seven years .
 The European Commission allocated €11 million of humanitarian assistance as well as €17 million in development aid for preparations for the winter and early recovery . An additional €4 million was provided to meet the recovery and integration needs of internally displaced persons .
Angela Merkel’s insistence on a pro-Russian Ukrainian representative in the Trilateral Contact Group was seen as a Russia-first approach . In Kiev, Russia- first approach contradicted EU's moral obligation to sustain its ‘potential we'
 ‘tier three’ sanctions did not take place until the tragic downing of MH-17 on 17 July 2014 . It led to the 31 July restrictions imposed on key sectors of Russia’s economy .
 The EU sanctions were working in tandem with the restrictions imposed by the US . They could not prevent Russia openly supplying weapons and troops, believed to be Russian forces, to Ukraine .
 Russian involvement could not be restrained by such symbolic signals, or additional sanctions, as well as those imposed in November 2014 . Russian defence enterprises Rosneft and Transneft are among those targeted .
 The issues at hand were not limited to an immediate response to the hostilities, but were related to the EU’s strategy towards its neighbourhood in general .
 Ukraine to benefit from the agreement prior to its ratification by the European Parliament and ­Verkhovna Rada on 16 September 2014 . The latter was especially reinforced by the option of a provisional application .
 The EU once again needed to find a answer to a new and unexpected challenge .
 The Commission's initial position was impossible to maintain, it was clear . It was clear that the initial position assumed by the Commission in 2013.
 The EU established trilateral negotiations, the first meeting being held on 11 July 2014 . The first meeting will be held in Moscow on July 11 2014 .
 The Minsk-I talks in autumn 2014 led to a solution announced on 30 October . The parties agreed to delay implementation of the DCFTA until the end of 2015, while prolonging the preferential arrangements for duty-free Ukrainian exports to the EU until 1 January 2016 .
 The EU demonstrated that it was matching its aspirations by defending its ‘potential we’ with action . Even though a possibility of renegotiation remained open until the beginning of 2016 .
 The postponing of the DCFTA raised concern, in Ukraine and beyond . Such proposals corresponded to Russian claim that engagement was 16 .
 Danylo Lubkivskiy, Ukraine Deputy Foreign Minister, resigned in protest at the delaying of the DCFTA . It is considered an indication of the EU giving in to Russia’s demands .
 The view of the gradual engagement with Russia was associated with the idea of the EU circumventing a fundamental disagreement and attempting to return to business as usual . Russia’s aspiration to seal a redefined interaction pattern.
 The EU was reluctant to subscribe to what was seen as a division into a sphere of interests associated with Russia’s ‘great-powerness’ The EU, however, was reluctant.
 The balance of the EU–Russian interaction in 2013-2014 left open the question of the definition of their modus vivendi . The EU's identity could be redefined, along with it, a potential redefinition of its identity .
 The initial interaction based upon the ‘generalized we’ was based on the socialization of both Ukraine and Russia . Two divergent interaction patterns corresponding to different EU identity categories.
 The SP has been a constant reference point in the EU–Russia relationship . In the EU-Ukraine relationship a SP was not in high demand .
 The gradual dissipation of EU–Ukraine SP official discourse has not been linked to a diminishing strategic importance of Ukraine to the EU or to reducing commonality of interests between the parties .
 The findings emphasize the importance of the ‘demand side’ in the evolution of the EU’s SP policy .
 The EU's strategic partners can determine their orientation towards/away from an SP with the EU, eventually changing the institutional pattern of relations . The EU’s strategic partners, in their interaction with the European Union, can determine the relationship .
 EU SP policy is also being actively shaped by the EU’s partners . The EU's partners are also actively shaping its policy .
 The result was the emerging Russian challenge to the autonomy of the EU ‘potential we’ It was the result of the emerging Russia challenge.
 The EU ­record in this regard is mixed. Third, the article has also shown that while the crisis in Ukraine gave the EU the challenge of protecting its ‘potential we’ vis-á-vis Russia, the EU’s record is mixed .
 Russia's contestation of the EU ‘potential we’ by indirectly instigating a military conflict indicated EU overstretch . Russia’s contestation. of the European Union ‘Potential We’ was indirectly instigated a military battle .
 Kiev's neutral status led to Kiev eventually changing its neutral status, thereby paving the way to the prospect of NATO membership .
 The EU found the necessary means to sustain its ‘potential we’ throughout 2013–2014. In this respect, the EU found a necessary means.
 At the same time, the Ukraine crisis made the EU rethink the suitability of an SP as a discursive and institutional expression of the EU–Russia relationship .
 SIT has demonstrated that SIT provides a fruitful ground for the analysis of EU foreign policy . SIT's contribution has shown that it is a useful tool for the EU's foreign policy.
 The acknowledgement of such multiple challenges to the EU provides a complementary explanation of why the EU was so profoundly overwhelmed and overstretched by the crisis .
 The EU 'prospective we' and the 'self– other' interaction have clearly interfered with each other, the EU says .
 The EU’s recalibration of its ‘self’, ‘significant/prospective we’ and ‘other’ may result in tensions and regional conflict, according to the EU . The findings of this contribution indicate that the EU�
