 Ukraine says it has struck a deal with pro-Russian separatists to withdraw tanks and light weapons from the frontline of the conflict in the east of the country . The deal was announced Wednesday .
 The Donbass region has seen its calmest period since a rarely respected international ceasefire agreement was signed last February . The deal remains uncertain as world powers prepare to review the deal on Friday .
 Representatives of Ukraine and the separatist rebels agreed on general conditions to extend a withdrawal that began at the start of September . More than 8,000 people have been killed in the conflict that has killed more than 7,000 .
 The draft deal results from talks in Minsk facilitated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe . The OSC has been monitoring the conflict .
 Bociurkiw notes that the full peace plan agreed at a summit between leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany in February is far from being fully implemented .
 Petro Poroshenko used his address to rail against Russian ‘aggression’ in reference to Kiev’s accusation that Moscow orchestrated and backed the rebels in the weeks following its annexation of Crimea in March 2014 .
 Poroshenko urged the world not to buy into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposals to form an international coalition to fight the Islamic State armed group in Syria .
 Russian president's focus on Syria is part of a geopolitical strategy to gain control of the Donbass . Russia ruled out any possibility of bilateral talks with Ukraine and avoided any mention of the conflict .
 French President François Hollande is to host Putin, Poroshenko and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris on Friday . Hollande will review technical aspects of the deal and not necessarily to negotiate a resolution of the conflict or an easing of international sanctions .
 The direction of global politics has brought doubt into Ukraine’s future . Ukraine's future is in doubt.
