 Since Ukraine exploded last week in a blaze of lethal violence and collapsed leadership, some ominous predictions have been circulating about Russiaâ€™s future .
Military intervention seems too high-stakes a game for Moscow to play. But military intervention seems to be too high stakes a game to play .
 The new leaders in Kiev are hardly more acceptable than the new leaders . And cooperating with them is hardly moreacceptable .
 Russia is far likelier to choose fence-sitting as its modus operandi, with a view to step in more actively when its chances for success improve . For now, in pursuing its national interests, Russia is more likely to focus on national interests .
 For days, Russia was, at best, incoherent and, at worst, stuck in denial about the new political reality in Ukraine . The de facto deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, has been ousted .
 President Vladimir Putin has said nothing publicly about Russia's new position on Ukraine . Putin held a Security Council meeting about Ukraine on Tuesday .
 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the Foreign Ministry have been busy casting doubt on the legitimacy of the new authorities .
Kremlin propagandists have been lashing out at Yanukovych for betraying Moscow . And Kremlin propagandist has been lashed out at the Yanukovych.
 Moscow's vested interest in integrating Ukraine into a Russia-led trading bloc is a key priority for Putin in his third presidential term . This floundering cannot last long given Moscowâ€™s vested interest.
 Cooperating, in this case, means sincere and effective action to help the new Ukrainian government keep its footing . This is a highly improbable option for Moscow.
 European Union officials have called on Russia to participate in joint financial assistance to Ukraine . They have invited Moscow to discuss the country's future .
 The development would fly in the face of numerous firm convictions held by the Kremlin in dealing with its neighbors . But this development would be a setback for the Kremlin .
 The Kremlin views the revolt in Ukraine as part of a zero-sum game with the West in the former Soviet republics . Moscow regards the Ukraine revolt as its zone of privileged interests .
For Putin, cooperating would mean acknowledging defeat in the largest, most prized of these now sovereign countries . For Putin, cooperation would mean admitting defeat in some of the most prized countries .
 Belarus, emboldening Western-leaning opposition groups and disheartening pro-Moscow incumbent leaders . Also, it would send the wrong message â€“ in the Kremlinâ€™s view â€“ to political players in other ex-Soviet republics .
There is a big risk that the new Ukrainian government will not be stable and effective . The country's dire economic situation is aggravated by the countryâ€™s dire economy .
 The second option, â€œspoiling,â€™ would require the active disruption and sabotage of Ukraineâ€™s new government . This would come at a price Moscow is not willing to bear .
 The U.S. and European leaders have already warned Moscow against possible military intervention in Ukraine . It is highly unlikely Putin would keep this option on the table even without the warnings .
 Radical, violent Ukrainian nationalists would be very likely to wage a campaign of terror and sabotage both in the occupied territories and in mainland Russia .
 Ukrainian elites would then seek stronger alliances with the West, including military ones . Also, were it to fail, would only strengthen anti-Moscow sentiments among Ukrainian elites .
 Propping up separatists in Crimea and in Ukraineâ€™s eastern provinces is also a road to violent conflict that Moscow cannot afford .
 Russia will either have to face the consequences described above or lose face. If these provinces eventually demand that Russia intervene and protect them, Russia will have to do so .
 Russia will not interfere in Ukraine, the Foreign Ministry says . The Foreign Ministry effectively ruled out military intervention .
 Russia has declared that it would freeze the remaining $12 billion of $15 billion in pledged aid to Ukraine until a working government is in place in Kiev . Russia has already declared it will freeze the remainder of the $12billion of pledged aid .
 Ukraine bans on Ukraine imports as it has in the past, including just last summer . It may also boost economic pressure by imposing bans.
 Russia is Ukraineâ€™s largest trade partner, responsible for nearly 30 percent of its foreign trade in 2012 . The EU is a close second in the world .
 import bans would not be the way to pressure Ukraine's new leadership into concessions that it could not deliver in any case, such as integration into Russia's trading bloc .
 Fence-sitting, under the circumstances, amounts to outsourcing the tough job of stabilizing Ukraine to the European Union .
 The EU might eventually offer Russia certain concessions in exchange for agreeing to share the burden of salvaging Ukraine, with its miserable economy .
 Such concessions could include lifting restrictions on Russian energy trade in the EU and visa-free travel long sought by Moscow .
 Moscow would be able to deal with a functioning, established government capable of reciprocity . After a time, things go well for Ukraine, things would go well.
 If the new government fails, Ukraine will see a wave of popular resentment for the idea of integration with the EU, especially in the eastern regions and Crimea .
 Moscow could then open its arms wide to embrace anyone disenchanted with the Europeans . This, in turn, would mobilize and empower proponents of closer ties with Moscow .
