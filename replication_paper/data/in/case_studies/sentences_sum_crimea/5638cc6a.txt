 The Ukrainian World Congress is calling for a worldwide boycott of goods made in Russia . It is in response to Russia's brazen aggression against Ukraine .
 Russia is persistently violating international conventions with its attempts to take control of Ukraine's territory . Russia is trying to take over Ukraine's Crimea from Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government .
Only 15% of voters supported annexation of Crimea, according to the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights . This was first evidenced by the illegal and forceful annexation.

 In Ukraine, he simply wants to grab territory that he believes rightly belongs to him . In Ukraine he just wants tograb territory he believes rightfully belongs to.
 He hopes his backing of fringe parties will destabilize his foes and install in Brussels politicians who will focus on dismantling the EU rather than enlarging it .
 Putin has taken the Jobbik party under his wing in Hungary . In Hungary, for example, Putin has been in charge of his party for years .
 Jobbik has supporters who dress in Nazi-type uniforms, spout anti-Semitic rhetoric, and express concern about Israeli "colonization" of Hungary . The third-largest party in the country, JobBik, is the third largest party in Hungary .
 The party has capitalized on rising support for nationalist economic policies . The party is seen as an antidote for unpopular austerity policies and for economic liberalization .
 Vona also met with Russia Duma leaders including Ivan Grachev, chairman of the State Duma Committee for Energy and Vasily Tarasyuk . Vona met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders .
 There have been persistent rumors that Jobbik's enthusiasm is paid for with Russian rubles . In fact, there have been rumors that he's paid for by Russia .
 The party has repeatedly criticized Hungary's "Euro-Atlantic connections" and the European Union . The party also has also repeatedly criticized the EU and the EU .
 Crimea is a country with extensive co-ethnic populations in Romania and Slovakia . The referendum in Crimea was called "exemplary," a dangerous word in the country .

Evidence of enthusiasm for Russia's foreign policy goals is open for all to see . But evidence of enthusiasm is open to all to seeing .
 Bulgaria has called repeatedly for Bulgaria to veto EU economic sanctions for Russia . Party leader Volen Siderov has called for the country to veto the sanctions .
 Putin government's cordial relations with Europe's far right sit oddly, to say the least, with his opposition to "Nazis" in the Ukrainian government .
 Putin's dislike for Ukrainian "fascists" has nothing to do with ideology, says Putin . Putin has no problem with Ukrainian ideology, he says .
 The country's Svoboda and Right Sector parties stand for independence in the post-Viktor Yanukovych Ukraine . Putin does not believe the country should exist separate from Russia .
 Russian support of the far right in Europe has less to do with ideology than with ideology . Russian support for far right is less than with his desire to destabilize European governments, prevent EU expansion, and bring to power European governments that are friendly to Russia .
Several European countries may only be one bad election away from disaster . In that sense, several European countries could only be a bad election .

 A weak economy was weakened further by the European Central Bank's austerity policies . The extreme right vote has caused a surge in support for the right .
Current polls show the far-right parties in France and Holland winning the largest share of seats in their national delegations . Current polls show that the far right parties in both countries are winning the most seats .
 Brussels strategists worry 20 percent of new parliament could be affiliated with parties that wish to abolish the EU . The current number of members of the new parliament is double the current number .
 That could cause an EU government shutdown to rival the dysfunction of Washington . That could deal a major blow to efforts to enlarge the Union and oppose Russian expansionism .
 Putin's strategy of using right-wing extremist political parties to foment disruption and then take advantage could work in southern and western Europe as well . It is strange to think that Russia's strategy could also work in Europe .
 Some of the extreme right parties in the European parliament may be funded by Russia . Or that some of the right parties work every day to delegitimize the European Union .
European leaders should start launching public investigations into external funding of extreme-right political parties . To counter Russia, European leaders should launch public investigations.
 If extensive Russia connections are found, it would be important to publicize that fact and then impose sanctions on Russia . It would make it more difficult for Russia to provide such support .
 Pro-European parties must find a way to mobilize voters who are notoriously unwilling to vote in European parliament elections . Pro- European parties need to find a solution to the problem .
 Europe will also have to rethink the austerity policies that have worsened the grievances of many Europeans . Europe's austerity policies have pushed them to support the anti-system, anti-European right .
 Germany has banned extreme right parties from representation, but other countries have not . Germany has also banned extremeright parties from representing .
 Germany may have underestimated the extent of damage austerity policies could do to the European project . Germany should rethink how its excessive budget cutting, monetary prudence, and export surpluses are affecting politics in the rest of Europe .
 pro-Russia far-right parties win a dramatic election victory in European parliamentary elections . Pro-Russia parties won a dramatic victory in the European elections .
 These elections could weaken the European Union and bring Russia's friends on the far right closer to power .
