 A military facility destroyed by shelling near Kyiv, 1 March 2022 . A short history of Russia's war on Ukraine.
To understand the tragedy of this war, it is worth going back beyond the last few weeks and months, and even beyond Vladimir Putin .
 Russia experts who had long told people to take it easy are now telling people to get worried . Some of the Russia experts had long said people should take iteasy .
 Others who had long criticised Putin said that he was just trying to draw attention to himself . Others said that it was all for show .
 Among the analysts, there was a debate between the troop watchers and TV watchers .
 The troop watchers saw the massive concentration of Russian forces at the border and in Crimea . They warned of invasion of Crimea .
 The TV watchers said that Russian TV was not ramping up war hysteria, as it usually does before a Russian invasion . The question was settled, for ever, on the night of 24 February, when Russian missiles hit military installations and civilian targets .
 Many more people had died of Covid-19 than was officially acknowledged . The space for political expression was narrowing .
 Putin was paranoid about it, forcing anyone who wanted to see him in person to quarantine for one week in advance in a hotel .
 No one thought things were going in the right direction, but none of them thought an invasion was actually going to happen . They thought Putin was engaged in coercive diplomacy .
I visited friends, listened to their reflections, gamed out the various scenarios . I visited friends and listened to them. I visited their reflections and gamed them out .
 Even if an invasion did happen, it would be over quickly, we all agreed . We all agreed. Even if it happened, it was over quickly .
 Putin had always been so cautious he never started a fight he wasn’t sure to win . Putin was always cautious.
Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning . We were all wrong .
 Russia experts who had been arguing for years that Putin was a bloody tyrant rushed forth to claim vindication, for he had undoubtedly become what they had claimed he was all along .
 Russia experts who had been arguing for years that we needed to heed Putin’s warnings could also claim vindication because Putin had finally acted on those warnings . Russia experts had argued for years for Russia that we should heed Putin's warnings .
 Ukrainians have frequently reminded us in the past two weeks, with the Russian incursion in 2014 . The war itself is not new, as Ukrainians have often reminded us of it .
This war was the decision of one person and one person only â Vladimir Putin . We are reaping the fruits of our failed policies in the region after the Soviet collapse, he says .
 He made the call in his Covid isolation, failed to mount any sort of campaign to garner public support . Just a few weeks before the invasion no one in Moscow thought it was going to happen .
 He clearly misunderstood the nature of the political situation in Ukraine, and the vehemence of the resistance he would encounter .
 The war is worth going back beyond the last few weeks and months, and even beyond Vladimir Putin, says CNN's John Sutter .
 Russia and Ukraine after the fall of the USSR, 30 years ago, have declared their independence .
 There was very little violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian exclave of Nagorno-Karabakh . There was no violence between the two countries .
In Moldova, Russian troops supported a small separatist movement of Russian-speakers . But gradually, almost imperceptibly, conflict began appearing at the edges of the former USSR .
 In Georgia, the autonomous region of Abkhazia, also supported by Russian arms, fought a short war with the central government in Tbilisi, as did South Ossetia . In Georgia.
 Chechnya, a Russian republic that had fiercely resisted the encroachment of the empire throughout the 19th century, declared its own wish for independence . It was ground down in not one but two brutal wars .
 Tajikistan endured a civil war, in part a fallout from the civil war raging in Afghanistan . The country shared a border with Afghanistan, with which it shares a border .
 In 2007, Russia launched a cyber-attack against Estonia, and in 2008, it responded to an attempt by Georgia to retake South Ossetia with a massive counter-offensive . In 2008, Russia responded to Georgia's attempt to retake the region.
 The dissolution of the Soviet Union had been miraculously peaceful . Despite all this, it was still common for people to say that the dissolution was peaceful .
In the laboratory of nation-building that was the former empire, Ukraine stood out . And then came Ukraine.
 Some of the Soviet former republics had longstanding political traditions and distinct linguistic, religious, religious and cultural practices . Others less so .
 Baltic states had each been independent for two decades between the world wars . The Baltic states were independent for 20 years between the wars .
 Most of the other republics had had a brief experiment with independence in the wake of the collapse of tsarism in 1917 .
Ukraine was unique on all these fronts . Many of the newfound nations had significant Russian-speaking populations who were either uninterested in or actively hostile toward their new national projects .
 It had only existed as an independent state in modern times for a few short years . It had a powerful nationalist movement, a vibrant literary canon, and a strong memory.
 Russia is the second-largest country in Europe after Russia . It was very large â the second largest country in the world .
 It was industrialised, being a major producer of coal, steel and helicopter engines, as well as grain and sunflower seeds . It was also a major producers of coal and steel, and was a major supplier of helicopter engines .
 Russia's population at the time it became independent in 1991 numbered 52 million . The population was second only to Russia among post-Soviet states .
It was strategically located on the Black Sea and on the border with numerous eastern European states and future Nato members . It was strategically Located on the black sea and on a border with several eastern European countries .
 The Russian tsars had spent their summers on the Crimean peninsula . It was the USSR’s largest warm water naval port, in Sevastopol .
 Ukrainian factories in Dnipropetrovsk were a vital part of the military-industrial capacity of the USSR . Russia’s largest export gas pipelines ran through Ukraine .
Without Ukraine's population, industry and agriculture, Russia would have ceased to be a great power . The same was true, or seemed to be true, in 1991, historian Dominic Lieven says .
 A statue in Kyiv of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, a 17th-century leader of Ukrainian Cossacks, is a statue of the Ukrainian leader .
 Efrem Lukatsky/APUkraine was not just geopolitically significant to Russia . It was also significant to Ukraine .
 The Russian and Ukrainian languages had diverged sometime in the 13th century . But the two remained close about as close as Spanish and Portuguese .
 While most of the country was ethnically Ukrainian, there was a large ethnic Russian minority . The east was particularly in the east, especially in the west .
 The lingua franca in most of the large cities was Russian . The official language was Ukrainian .
 Most people knew both languages, but most people knew each other .
 It was common on television to see a journalist ask a question in Russian and receive an answer in Ukrainian . It was also common to have a panel of experts for a talent show with two Russian-language judges and two Ukrainian- language judges .
From a Russian nationalist perspective, that was a problem . It was a genuinely bilingual nation . It's a rare thing .
 Once you start thinking about Crimea, you then started thinking about eastern Ukraine . And once you started thinking of Crimea, then you then began thinking about Ukraine .
 There were also Russians in northern Kazakhstan, and eastern Estonia . To be sure, there were also Russian in other places .
 There were irredentist claims on these areas as well, and occasionally they flared up . There wereirredentists claims on this area as well .
 The writer turned political provocateur Eduard Limonov, for example, was arrested in Moscow in 2001 for allegedly plotting to invade northern Kazakhstan and declare it an independent Russian republic .
For the first 20 years of independence, Russia kept a very close eye on developments in Ukraine . But no place held such a central part in the Russian historical imagination as Ukraine .
 Many of the new post-Soviet countries had their share of problems, including corrupt elites, restive ethnic minorities, a border with Russia . Many of these countries had problems with corrupt elites.
 There was plenty of it to steal. Because it was large and industrialised, there was plenty to steal .
 Odesa had an easily accessible seaway through which to steal it . The city had a major Black Sea port in the city ofOdesa .
 Much of the equipment of the old Ukrainian army was smuggled out of the country through that port . Ukraine was, if not divided, then certainly not immediately recognised as a unified whole .
 Because it had so many times been conquered and partitioned, the country’s historical memory itself was fractured .
 The legacy of the Cossack hetmanate of the 17th century was anarchism, historian says . Ukraine's political culture is one of the most treasured aspects of the political culture.
 In terms of the construction of a modern state, it had its drawbacks . But in terms of construction, it has its drawbacks, says the author .
 In a now-infamous CIA analysis written shortly after the creation of independent Ukraine, it was predicted that there was a good chance the country would fall apart . Yet, for two decades, it didn't .
 democracy was rooted deep in Ukrainian political culture, and so in Russia power was never transferred to an opposition, in Ukraine it happened again and again . For better and worse, it was rooted in Ukraine's political culture .
 Leonid Kuchma promised better relations with Russia and to give Russian language equal status in Ukraine . In 1994, the first president of Ukraine,Leonid Kravchuk was voted out of office .
 Viktor Yanukovych voted out in favour of a more nationalist and pro-European candidate, Viktor Yushchenko . In 2004, his hand-picked successor, Viktor Yanukovych, was voted out .
 Yanukovych was thrown out of office by the Maidan revolution in 2014 . But Yanukovych was ousted from office in February 2014 .
 Petro Poroshenko was replaced by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a Russian-speaking pro-peace candidate .
 Viktor Yushchenko won the re-run of the 2004 presidential election in Ukraine . He was elected president of Ukraine in 2004 . He won the election in 2004.
 Fist-fights in the Rada were common and protests were a fact of ordinary life .
 There were massive protests against Kuchma, for example, in 2000, when a recording surfaced of him apparently ordering the murder of Georgiy Gongadze .
 Yushchenko, the opposition candidate in 2004, barely survived a dioxin poisoning, which had all the markings of a Russian special operation .
 The initial round of voting in 2004 was marked by severe irregularities and clear voter fraud such as had not yet appeared in Russia . The first round was marked with severe irregularities .
 Yushchenko won another round of voting in the Orange Revolution . It took mass protests, known as Orange Revolution, to win the vote .
 Yushchenko himself presided over a fair election in 2010, which he lost . He subsequently presided over the fair election, but lost .
 The changes of power were alternately tumultuous and pedestrian . But they reflected genuine differences of opinion among the populace about what Ukraine should be .
 Some thought Ukraine should integrate further with Europe, others that it should remain friendly and closely connected with Russia . Others thought Ukraine shouldn't integrate further.
For Russian speakers and Ukraine’s remaining Jewish population, the memory of the second world war of resistance to Nazi invasion and occupation, remained an important touchstone .
 The Cossack Hetmanate sought the protection of the Russian tsar . The occupation of their country began in 1921 or 1939 .
 The Ukrainian Insurgent Army, who opposed both Soviet and German occupation in western Ukraine, were seen as fascist villains by the Soviets . They were, in the nationalist narrative, the George Washingtons of Ukrainian history .
 For nationalists, the signal tragedy of the 20th century was not the Nazi invasion, but instead the great famine of 1932-33 . Millions of Ukrainians died in the famine, in which millions of Ukrainian died .
People lighting candles last year at a monument in Kyiv for victims of the Holodomor famine of 1932-33 . The famine was consistently referred to as a deliberate act by Stalin to destroy the country .
All these arguments took place against a backdrop of economic stagnation .
 Ukraine’s economy was consistently one of the weakest in the former Soviet bloc . UkraineâsEconomy was consistently a weak member of the Soviet bloc.
 Ukraine was dependent on cheap gas from Russia as well as the  transit fees it charged for Russian gas going to Europe . Ukrainians living under these see-sawing politics, going from hope to disappointment and back again, it felt like their lives were passing them by
 A journalist I met in Kyiv in 2010, who had taken part in the protests that were part of the Orange Revolution and was then let down by Yuschenko’s presidency, lamented the missed opportunities .
 He couldn't believe how little had been done since 2005, and since 1991, since 1991 . He couldn’t believe how much had beendone since 2005 .
 The more time passed, the more Ukraine’s fragile nationhood could coalesce . The more UkraineâsFragile nationhood may coalesce.
 It begins with the pictures in the first book your mother reads you, according to the song .
 The more people who were born in Ukraine, rather than the USSR, the more people grew up thinking of Kyiv as their capital . The more they learned the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian history, the stronger Ukraine would become .
 Volodymyr Zelenskiy played a Russian-speaking high school history teacher who suddenly becomes president . The show made him famous in Ukraine and catapulted him to the presidency .
 For Russia, Nato is a four-letter word. It was violent Russian opposition to EU membership for Ukraine that in late 2013 precipitated the Maidan revolution . In turn, it precipitated Russian annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine .
After the end of the cold war, it was Nato expansion that had been the greatest irritant to the relationship between Russia and the west . The relationship found Ukraine trapped in between.
 In the immediate wake of the Soviet collapse, it was not a foregone conclusion that Nato would get bigger .
 In fact, most U.S. policymakers, and the United States military, opposed expanding the alliance .
This changed in the early years of the Clinton administration . It had served its purpose to contain the Soviet Union . Now everyone could go their separate ways .
After 1991, the post-communist countries of eastern Europe found themselves in an uncertain security environment . One was a group of idealistic foreign policy hands inside the Clinton national security council . The other was the eastern European states .
 Nearby Yugoslavia was falling apart, and they had their own potential border disputes . Nearby Yugoslavs were falling apart.
 Bill Clinton announced in 1994 that Nato will not take on new members but when . It was after a meeting with, among others, VÃ¡clav Havel and Lech WaÅ’sa .
 Five years later, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were inducted into Nato . The Czech Republic and Hungary were also inducted in Nato .
 In the years to come, 11 more countries would join, bringing the total number of countries in the alliance to 30 .
 Russia did not object to Nato until recently, when it was searching for a pretext to invade Ukraine . Some U.S. pundits and policymakers have claimed that Russia didn't object.
 Boris Yeltsin reacted with fury when he realised Nato was actually moving ahead with its plans to include the eastern European states .
Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in the U.S. in 1995. He predicted that a •’s ‘cold peace’ in Europe would be the result .
Russia was too weak, and still too dependent on western loans, to do anything except complain and watch warily as Nato increased in power .
 The alliance’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 was particularly disturbing to the Russian leadership .
 It was, first of all, an intervention in a situation that Russia viewed as an internal conflict . Russia viewed the situation as aninternal conflict .
 After Nato intervention, it was, in effect, no longer part of Serbia .
 The Russians had their own Kosovo-like situation in Chechnya, and it suddenly seemed to them that it was not impossible that Nato could intervene in that situation .
 U.S. conventional forces are seen as the real state of the U.N. forces in the United States . They see what the actual state of United States was .
 The U.S. intervened to basically break Kosovo off of Serbia . The next year, Russia officially changed its military doctrine to say that it could, if threatened, resort to tactical nuclear weapons .
 One of the authors of the doctrine told the Russian military paper Krasnaya Zvezda that Nato’s eastward expansion was a threat to Russia . This was the reason for the lowered threshold for the use of nuclear weapons .
 The second post-Soviet round of Nato expansion was the largest. That was 22 years ago . The second round of NATO expansion was largest .
 Agreed to in 2002 and made official in 2004, it brought Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovakia and Slovenia into the alliance . In 2004, the alliance was made official, and it made Bulgaria and Estonia into an alliance .
 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were once part of the Soviet Union . Almost all these states were part of a Soviet bloc, and Estonia and Latvia were in the Soviet bloc .
As this was happening, a series of events shook up the Russian periphery . Now they had joined the west .
 The U.S. and Ukraine in 2004 and Kyrgyzstan in 2005 all used mass protests to eject corrupt pro-Russian incumbents .
 The events were greeted with great enthusiasm in the west as a reawakening of democracy . But scepticism and trepidation in the Kremlin as an encroachment on Russian space .
The Kremlin might not have been right about a long-range western plot, but they weren't wrong to think that the west never saw it as an equal, as a peer .
 The fact is that at every turn, at every sticking point, in every situation, the west, and the United States did what it wanted to do, says CNN's John Sutter .
 It was, at times, exquisitely sensitive to Russian perceptions . At other times, it was cavalier. It was at times sensitive to Russians' perceptions .
 Russia defeated Georgia in a decisive five-day war in 2008 . A few months later, up to that point, was the most significant military action outside its borders .
 If Nato had moved faster and accepted Ukraine and Georgia much earlier, none of what followed would have happened .
 The U.S. and its allies should have been extra careful over Nato, it is claimed . But one could also argue that, in the face of mounting Russian alarm and repeated warnings about Nato, the United States and allies should be extra careful .
 They should have taken into account the specificity of the places they were dealing with, in particular Ukraine .
 Ukraine was not Russia, in Leonid Kuchma’s famous phrase, but it was also not Poland .
 Ukraine's Nato bid in 2008 was pushed forth by the western-friendly Yushchenko administration . But as Nato and the EU expanded further east, their representatives considered it a matter of principle not to make compromises with a regime they viewed as trying to bully them and Ukraine .
 Putin has been warning of this invasion, in one form or another, for 15 years . In practice, Putin has warned of this invade, in a form or other, for 20 years .
 The sanctions we are now seeing should have been deployed after the war in Georgia in 2008, or after the polonium poisoning in London of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 .
 He has embarked on a murderous and criminal war that also appears almost certain to be judged a colossal strategic blunder . The war has galvanised Nato, galvanising Nato, destroying his economy and isolating his country .
 There have always been multiple competing views of Putin, falling along different axes as to his competence, his intelligence, his morality .
Five years ago in this paper, I made the case that Putin was basically a normal politician in the Russian context . That is, some people who thought he was evil also thought that he was smart, and some people thought he wasn't .
 The way he prosecuted the war in Chechnya was evidence enough of his bad intentions . That didn't mean he was in any way admirable .
 The person who took over from Yeltsin was almost certain to have been a nationalist authoritarian, whether or not he was named Vladimir Putin .
 There was some limited historical evidence in the persons of Boris Yeltsin and Dmitry Medvedev that he would not .
 The attempted poisoning with a nerve agent of the oppositionist Alexei Navalny would almost certainly have had to have Putin's approval .
 Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov were killed on the order of the Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov . There was good reason to believe that the journalist and politician were killed .
 Kadyrov was Putin’s loyal ally, but they were not one and the same .
 Talk of a dictatorship in Russia obscured the fact that the country still had some room, albeit narrowing by the year, for freedom of thought .
 He was not wrong to think Ukraine was integrating further and further into the west. Objectively, he was not right to think that Ukraine was integrated further and closer into the West .
 The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement that he had so fiercely opposed in 2013 had been signed in 2014 and gone into effect in 2017 . The agreement has now been signed into effect.
 Putin’s attempt to exert control over Ukrainian politics had failed . Putin's attempt to create breakaway republics in Donetsk and Luhansk had failed.
 Ukrainians who had been lukewarm toward Nato now supported joining . Many who had entertained pro-Russian sentiments had seen what Russian puppets had done in breakaway republics .
 Ukraine, an imperfect democracy, scored a 61 on the Freedom House scale in 2021 . The Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics scored a 4.5%. Ukraine, a democracy, also scored a 3.5% in 2021, according to Freedom House .
 Putin had won Crimea and some territory in the east, but he had lost Ukraine . He had won some territory, but had lost some territory .
In the wake of Joe Biden's election, things were going less and less in Putin’s favour . But he was not entirely out of options .
 The Minsk-2 agreement was never actually implemented by either side . It had obliged Ukraine to reintegrate the Donetsk and Luhansk republics into a federated Ukraine . It would essentially have veto power over the country’s foreign policy .
 If he had previously left implementation of the Minsk agreement to a democratically elected Ukrainian government, he could decide not to make that mistake again .
He must have been emboldened by what had happened in Ukraine in 2014 . He had found great success, often at relatively little cost, by being a kind of international spoiler to the west .
There was also important factor that Putin did not believe Ukraine was a real country . If a ragtag outfit could do something like that, imagine what an actual army could do .
 Many Russians don’t see why Ukraine should be independent . This was not specific to Putin .
 Putin has become a real obsession, impermeable to contradictory evidence . But with Putin this has become an obsession, it has become more apparent than ever . It is not always clear whether Putin is the real obsession .
 One type of leader would see that Ukraine refuses to submit to his will and conclude that it was an independent entity . Another would see Ukraine refuse to submit.
 For Putin this could only mean that it was controlled by someone else . But for Putin this is not the first time this has happened . For Putin, this could mean that he was controlled.
 Putin had installed puppets to run the self-proclaimed people’s republics in eastern Ukraine . After all, this was already in the parts of Ukraine that Putin had conquered .
 Putin, obviously, but also western military analysts who had accurately predicted the invasion but inaccurately thought the war would be over very quickly, and possibly even the Ukrainians .
Before the war, sociologists who studied Ukraine pointed to a fairly high willingness on the part of Ukrainians to fight for their country . It was one thing to tell a sociologist, and it was another thing to go and fight .
Putin clearly did not expect Volodymyr Zelenskiy to turn into Winston Churchill . But clearly, clearly, the Ukrainians have decided to fight .
 A political novice from the country's industrial south-east, he won 73% of the vote in a runoff against Petro Poroshenko .
 Poroshenko's campaign warned that Zelenskiy was a Kremlin stooge who would sell out the country . Poroshenko’s campaign said he would sell the country.
By the time war rolled around, Zelenskiy was no longer popular. People voted for him anyway .
 He had failed to find a peaceful solution to the festering conflict in the Donbas region . He had started persecuting his opponents, and he had started persecution .
 Viktor Medvedchuk, a close ally of Putin, was placed under house arrest . Poroshenko, still Zelenskiyyâ’s main political rival, was charged with treason for some business dealings .
 Zelenskiy insisted the threat was not real. And then, when the clouds of war started gathering, he insisted it was not .
 The night before the invasion, he told Ukrainians they could sleep soundly that night . He also told Ukrainians to sleep soundfully that night.
 Zelenskiy had made clear that he did not want war . But the first Russian missiles hit their targets before dawn . The day before, in his anguished, last-minute appeal to the Russian people, he made clear .
 It was also the case that he did not have much room for compromise. But it was also that he didn't have much time for compromise, he said .
 The only clear path to peace had become, with the passage of time, even more intolerable to Ukrainians than it had been at their signing . "The only clearPath to peace" had become.
 At the end of the day, people don’t like to feel as if they have been bullied into compromise by their larger and angrier neighbour .
 A compromise by Zelenskiy that ceded too much would probably lead to the overthrow of his government . The only way to avoid war was through a craven surrender, then it would have to be war .
 The Russian leadership continues to put forth maximalist demands . As of this writing, a settlement looks far away, with the Russian leadership still putting forth maximalists .
 Zelenskiy will be able to accept a Russian Crimea and eastern Ukraine after all the blood his people have spilled . Whether the people will accept it is an open question .
There will be another opportunity to welcome Russia again into the concert of nations . There will be a chance to see Russia again in the concert.
 Our job then will be to do it differently than we did it this time, in the post-Soviet period . Our job will be the same as we did this time in the Soviet period .
 Slovenia was not part of the Soviet bloc as stated in an earlier version of the earlier version . Slovenia was in the Soviet Union but was not a member of the bloc .
