 The strategy proved to be inefficient due to the fact that Ukraine did not hold the required leverage for this kind of strategy . The consequence was observed in the current instability from the Ukrainian state .
 At the same time, these events are the effect of an announced Russia’s change of strategy . Russia has announced a new strategy for Russia .
 Crimea’s annexation and the violent acts from Donbas put under question mark the security and stability of the entire European continent . Crimea's annexation puts under question the security of the European continent.
 Russia was perceived as a revisionist state that did not follow the international rules anymore . Russia was seen as a Revisionist state, not following the rules anymore.
 Ukraine was viewed as a new type of war in terms of tactics. To a certain point the events from Ukraine were viewed as new kind of war . The events were seen as a 'new type of conflict'
 The present article aims to analyse the degree to which the events from Ukraine were predictable . It aims to examine the degree of predictability in Ukraine .
 The article will concentrate on document analysis . In order to emphasize the correlation between the different/similar meanings that are displayed within the official documents and the discourse level .
 "Nothing in politics happens by accident," says the author of the book . The book is based on the book "The Ukraine JEL classification" and "The European Union"
 Franklin Roosevelt. If something does happen, it was planned that way, he said .
 In August 2008, the demarcation between the East and the West was clearly established . The East and West were clearly established in August 2008 .
Russian foreign policy towards the West was a pivotal moment for the Russian foreign policy . It highlighted the change of paradigm from cooperation towards competition .
 The Georgian war proved both the Russian power and readiness for unilateralism when considered a suitable option . But it also had limitations in terms of interdependence between it and the Western powers .
 Medvedev might have been perceived as a more proWestern leader since his discourse was based on Moscow's readiness to cooperate with the West . The Georgian war proved the contrary .
 The program was designed to offer intensives for six Eastern States (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine)
 Russian Federation implemented what was to be called the Eurasian Union project . In response, the Russian Federation used the direct proportionality method .
 Moscow’s behaviour may be seen as predictable. Since the Russian frustration against the Eastern states like Moldova and Ukraine was evident, Moscow's behaviour may have been predictable .
 Putin has used the stick strategy of cutting energy exports towards these states or increasing the prices per 1000 cubic metres in terms of natural gas .
 Russian authorities may have taken into consideration a war in Ukraine as a viable option . But if we analyse the Russian behaviour and discourse of Vladimir Putin since he came to power in the 2000s, we may acknowledge the fact that maybe the events from Ukraine were not a surprise .
 The EU should have acted differently, or at least it should have reacted sooner, says the EU . We may also realise that the EU, especially, should haveacted differently .
 The present article aims to analyse the degree to which the events from Ukraine were predictable . The West might have expected the Russian reactions given its behaviour since especially the Georgian war .
 The article is part of a larger research regarding the predictability of the Ukrainian events . It also takes into consideration the strategic documents of the Russian Federation since Putin came into power .
 The present article will concentrate on the document analysis in order to emphasize the correlation between the different/similar meanings that are displayed within the strategic, official documents and the discourse level .
 Russia lost its status of a great power that was equal among the group of states that influenced the international relations scene . After the end of the Cold War through the disbandment of USSR, Russia was the official follower of the USSR .
 Russia succeeded in emerging as a great power that has the capabilities to defend its international interests and prestige by using its military and economic instruments . From this status of being a previous global power that lost even its regional influence, Russia succeeded .
 Russian behaviour over the years will be on resuming and highlighting the main Russian behaviour patterns in relation to the West . In order to understand the Russian recent unilateral behaviour and the Ukrainian crisis we must firstly analyse the Russian behaviour .
 Russia was and still is the largest country in the world, with no natural borders . Russia is now the world's largest country, with a population of more than 100 million people .
 The Russian borders expanded and contracted periodically over the years . This lack of natural protection against the outside may give instability in terms of national security .
 This need to find secure frontiers generated in Moscow an expansion need based strategy which can be seen during the First World War in its attempts to seize Poland and during the Second World War with Eastern Europe .
 The Russian desire and perceived need to be a great power remained constant over the years . It can be seen even today with some variations, including some variations .
 The disbandment of USSR is seen as ‘the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century’ in the eyes of Russian leaders . Now, a return to that status quo is unlikely and even irrational from the costs-benefits point of view .
 Russian authorities need to secure the Russian borders by expanding them, says author . Russia has a regional hegemon with no challenger in its region .
 Moscow has two neighbours with an expanding influence, at the West the EU and NATO and at the East China . The current need to protect its developed influence beyond the Russian national borders can be explained .
 Russia had and still has the means to be an important player at international level . Russia still has a chance to be a player at the international level.
 Andrei Tsygankov’s classification of Russian behaviour throughout history . In terms of behavioural pattern, I will relate to Andrei's classification ofRussian behaviour .
 Russia proved patterns of defensiveness in its trying to contain NATO’s expansion after the Cold War . Russia became assertive in the case of the Georgian War and the current Ukrainian crisis .
 The Russian foreign policy proved itself to be rather constant and did not witness a change over the years .
 Russia almost obsessively felt the need to demand its right to have an independent policy first from the Holly Roman Empire and nowadays from the West .
 The largest state in the world is claiming its right to be independent . It is the largest state that is claiming the right to independent .
 Putin was in favour of creating a system of great powers that resembled with the Concert of Europe from the 19th century . Russia is part of the group and has its influence, interests and security protected by this balance of power .
 In his view, Russia had the right to conduct a foreign policy that was independent, thus distinct from the one of the sole superpower .
 Taking this aspect into consideration this policy was different, if not divergent from the others. Taking this part into consideration was different.
 For Putin this was the potential that Russia had and he had to regain Russia’s former status . For Putin, this was a potential that he had. For Putin it was for him to regain his former status.
 Russia faced some international changes that needed time in order to produce positive results . Referring to the domestic level in the early 2000 before Putin came to power, the lack of external power projection was partly explained by the fact that Russia faced international changes .
 The economic policy of what was called the ‘shock therapy’ had negative outcomes for the Russian society . It was already passing through the loss of international prestige once the Cold War ended .
 The unemployment rate increased, the national currency depreciated thus decreasing the life quality of the Russian citizens . The unemployment rates increased .
 All these aspects generated discontent among the Russian voters for Eltin’s reforms and prepared the ground for a more traditional assertive president .
 Vladimir Putin came to power as a man "from nowhere" in particular, with little known personal history . Putin won the elections from 2000s to become Russia's new leader .
 Putin emphasised Russia’s role at international level through cooperation, as it was in the case of war on terror . He sustained Russia's natural right to defend it and to imply its own interests upon it .
 Russia saw Europe as a threat in terms of identity, it stopped defining itself as being European .
 The Russian Ministry of Culture introduced the statement “Russia is not Europe’s Europe” in spring 2014 . It is the first time the statement has been introduced in Russia .
 Russia's main competition in its area of influence according to Russia’s perceptions is the European Union's and NATO's expansion towards East . Russia's perceptions of the EU's andNAT's expansion is based on its perceptions of Europe .
 Ukraine is a quintessential element for the Russian European identity and the Russian language . Russia is a great power and thus of its natural area of influence .
 Russia felt threatened and needed a defensive response to an expanding West towards Russia’s own backyard . The Russian logic and philosophy regarding itself generated an assertive behaviour .
In order to understand Moscow’s behaviour, we must look through Russian lens, thus we must understand how Russia is defining itself .
 The Ukrainian crisis has been described as a challenger to Russia’s regional hegemonic position . In order to develop a glibly analysis, we must analyse the policies that the EU implemented in the Eastern European region since it is perceived as being a challenger .
 The European Union and its Eastern Neighbourhood. After the big bang enlargement, the EU transformed itself from an international organization that had 15 member states mainly Western powers to 27 members .
 Russia had the legitimacy, capabilities and responsibility to act beyond its territory . At the same time, we must take into account that the EU saw itself as a global power .
 The new EU member states are mainly located at the Eastern frontier of the EU . Poland, Moldova, Romania and the Republic of Moldova are among the new member states .
 The EU decision makers saw this change since 2004, when the European Neighbourhood Policy was launched .
 The Russian Federation was invited to be part of the policy’s programs, it denied . It denied it was part of its policy's programs .
 The choice is rather predictable if we think of Russian logic and almost obsessive demand of equality with other international powers . The choice of the Russian government is not predictable .
 Being part of the ENP would have meant in the Russian eyes the acknowledgement of the fact that the European soft model was a better model that the Russian one .
 Russia is not just a neighbour of the EU, it is already a great power . Being put on the same position as Libya was not something that would be acceptable for Moscow .
 The ENP can be interpreted as an alternative to the EU's enlargement policy . The EU faced the biggest wave of enlargement till present and needed time to adjust to those changes .
 Eastern states like Ukraine and Moldova expressed their choice for membership perspectives . Some countries that are part of the ENP do not want or cannot be part of EU due to geographical reasons .
 ENP's success was questionable, given the Syrian and Ukrainian current dynamics and the program’s objective of creating a peaceful neighbouring area . Therefore, the ENP”s success was and still is questionable, according to the Syrian government .
 In 2008, the EU needed to respond to major security challenges, especially after the Georgian war erupted . The EU faced a major security challenge in 2008 after the war in Georgia .
 The middle way offered by the EaP proved to work counterproductively for both the EU and its external partners . The middle-way offered to the EAP was the best way to work for both EU and external partners.
 The EU was trying to develop an economic and political relationship with six Eastern European states without giving clear perspectives . If we correlate the perceived needs of the partners with the activities and the purpose of the program, we will see that often they do not converge, says the EU .
 Ukraine has a rapprochement of Kiev towards the Western model and a balancing action against the Russian one . Ukraine did not offer the membership perspectives that Ukraine hoped for .
 Ukrainian economy and security have been blocked in this position . This balancing based strategy proved to be counterproductive for the Ukrainian economy . It ultimately generated a doubtful status quo at the regional level .
 Yanukovych’s refusal to sign the AA generated the Euromaidan and the change of the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Nikolai Azarov and ultimately of the President .
 The Foreign Ministers of Germany, France and Poland have tried to control the violence . At the regional level, the regional power, the EU, sustained the democratic civil moves .
 The Russian Federation perceived the change of Yanukovych as a threat to its interests in Crimea . The other part of the negotiations was the Russian Federation .
 The support of the Euromaidan towards the West generated fears in Moscow that Crimea may become a NATO military base . Crimea may lose one of its strategic points in the Black Sea .
 Moscow's perceptions were that the EU was too divided so it could not have offered Kiev the needed support . Moscow’s perceptions of the EU were that it was not offering Kiev the support .
 Russia offered financial support and tried to keep Ukraine on its desired path . Within this framework Russia offered its financial support to Ukraine .
 The fragmented domestic situation from Ukraine generated centrifugal behaviour patterns at the Eastern part of the state . There lived a large part of a Russian minority that preferred the Russian led international structures .
 This domestic situation created a vulnerable position for the national security of Ukraine, says the author . The situation was present for years in the Ukrainian society, he says .
 maps show the results of the 2010 and 2014 elections and the places where the protests erupted . The map of ethnicity on the Ukrainian territory was added to the map of Ukraine .
 Russian pressures increased after protests erupted and the state was divided once again between the East and the West . Fisher, 2014, is the first time the Russian state has been divided between the two sides .
 Vladimir Putin asked the approval of the Russian Rada to deploy military forces to protect the ethnic Russians from Crimea . Security of Russian citizens that live abroad is one of the main elements of Russian’s right to act beyond its borders .
 This was the justification in the case of the Georgian intervention and was used also in Crimea . This was also used in the cases of Crimea and Crimea .
 This article offered the Russian leaders the legitimacy to act having the legal support and ensured the domestic approval of the Russian voters . This article offers the Russian leader the legitimate to act.
 This article is in accordance with the Russian philosophy of protecting itself and its people from external threats . The article is based on the philosophy of protect itself from external threat .
 Moscow's actions were not perceived by the domestic level as being assertive, but rather based on defensive grounds . Russia has a moral responsibility to protect all its citizens, not only those that live within its national borders .
 Russian Constitution can also be interpreted as a declaration of being a regional power that has the right, legitimacy, capability and the moral duty to act beyond its territory .
 Russian perception this kind of action can and would take the form of a defensive action against an outside threat .
 Crimea can hardly be defined as a defensive act and a democratic result since the Crimean citizens were hardly persecuted . But their rights were limited, they were not vitally threatened .
 Constitution from 1992 offered special status of Crimea . In terms of available choices, they rather did not exist .
 The return of this peninsula to the previous ante Vilnius status quo was not possible . Therefore, ultimately, ultimately the return of the peninsula to this peninsula is not possible.
 The south-eastern part of Ukraine witnessed series of protests and even violent acts between the pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian authorities . The Ukrainian state is in a situation in which its territorial integrity and its domestic security are questioned .
 Ukraine is seen at the regional level, taking into consideration the competition between the regional players . The EU's lack of unity and clear perspectives over Eastern Europe can be explained by the EU’s lack ofunity and clear views .
 The membership desiderate remained unspoken. At the level of implemented programs, it created incentives for Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova .
 The program did not reach from its inception the Eastern countries’ needs and even more importantly, it did not take into consideration Russia’s reactions .
 The EU defines itself as a global power that sustains its soft power model through it normative character to which other actors can relate .
 Ukraine events after the Vilnius Summit were the expression of the Ukrainian people democratic will towards the West . Russia's actions were aggressive in their nature and represented the Russian unilateral expression of breaking the international norms like the territorial integrity, inviolability of frontiers and the right of a state
 Putin acted in a defensive manner, following the above-mentioned logic and Russian philosophy over Eastern European region . At the same time, taking into consideration the Russian already implemented actions .
 Russia made it clear that it would not allow a further expansion of its two competitors in its own neighbourhood . Russia would not accept a direct border with them if Ukraine would become a part of the Western organizations .
 Ukraine is not only part of its area of influence, but is a strategic, core interest of Russia since it is defined as being part of the Russian identity .
 Russia signed an AA with the EU would have been the first step in extracting Ukraine from the Russian orbit . NATO and there were no membership perspectives for Ukraine neither in NATO nor in the EU .
 Russia's actions were mainly targeting NATO possible expansion, annexing Crimea and maintaining its influence in the Black Sea . The general pattern is for a state to firstly become part of the EU and afterwards part of NATO and afterwards.
 All these elements should have been considered factors of predictability and predictability . West should have considered factors such as predictability, says West .
 The West has denied to be able to explain the international dynamics of Russian behaviour . Russia's behaviour patterns should have been the neo-realist aspect of the Russian behaviour patterns .
 The entire political philosophy of Putin was and is still based on the antithesis towards the West and the right of Russia to be an equal power that has an independent power .
 Given the Russian neo-realist behaviour, and the soft power of its neighbour, it developed itself as a military power .
 Following the logic of this kind of power, it would try to impose itself as a hegemon rather than a leader .
 The Russian Federation proves itself to be rather constant in its behaviour towards the West . The EU started to be perceived as a threat and NATO redefined itself and developed into a more powerful organization .
 After 2000 the expansion of both organizations was seen as a threat by Russian authorities . Russian authorities already felt the almost obsessive need of parity with the West .
 Ukraine has proved assertive in Ukraine, says Ukraine's foreign minister . Ukraine has been in Ukraine for more than a decade . Ukraine's government has been trying to protect itself from the outside .
 In Ukraine the domestic fragmented situation between the voters created huge discrepancies in terms of political choices and ultimately centrifugal behaviours . In Ukraine, in Ukraine, the domestic fragmentation situation between voters and voters creates huge discrepancies .
 Ukraine never pursed a constant pro-Western strategy towards the West, being more than once hesitant . Second time Ukraine has been hesitant about the West .
 Thirdly, it was and remained dependent on the Russian energy exports . It was a transit state for the European importers. Thirdly. It was still dependent on Russian energy export .
 The West's responsibility in playing in the Russian backyard and not reacting sooner and in a more constant manner, we should acknowledge also the West’s responsibility .
