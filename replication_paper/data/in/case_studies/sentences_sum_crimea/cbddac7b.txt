 The Ukraine crisis has been described as a “civil war’ and a ‘civil war,’ according to CNN’s John Sutter . Sutter says the Ukraine crisis is a ’civil war.’
 Richard Sakwa's Russia Against the West: The Post-Cold War Crisis of World Order and Anna Matveeva’s Through Times of Trouble: Conﬂict in Southeastern Ukraine Explained From Within .
 Two books under review would be included within the second of nine categories that these publications are divided into . The two books would be under review .
 American-Ukrainian and Ukrainian-Canadian academic institutions do not traditionally cover politics and international relations . They have largely ignored the Donbas conﬂict and Crimea .
 The Ukrainian diaspora proved to be a paper tiger compared to the Croatian which collected huge sums of money and sent thousands of volunteers to Croatian war of independence in the 1990s .
 The overwhelming majority of Western authors writing about the crisis and war have never traveled to Ukraine . The majority of the writers have never visited Ukraine .
 A Ukrainian expert noted, “Many people participate in the discussions about the Donbas’s Donbas .
 The absence of research in Kyiv and Eastern and southern Ukraine does not excuse the absence of work in Ukraine .
 The books include interviews with Ukrainian oﬃcials, civil society activists, and soldiers at the central and local levels . Barely any of these publications are under review .
 Anna Matveeva is an exception to the above as she traveled to Russian-controlled Donbas enclaves and to Moscow where she conducted many interviews in the course of her work .
 The book's great value is in providing a bottom-up view of the Donbas rebels through interviews with local and Russian actors . Unlike the majority of scholars writing on the crisis who use primarily secondary sources .
 Matveeva’s book would have been greatly improved if her research had been balanced with similar ﬁeldwork in Eastern and Southern Ukraine .
 Russian-language media remains prevalent in Ukraine and many publications have Russian and Ukrainian versions . Many publications in Ukraine have Russian or Ukrainian versions.
 Few scholars use sources from Ukraine and for Western Russianists . The default is always to use source from Russia .
 Richard Sakwa's only sources from Ukraine are the English-language Kyiv Post, in contrast to 75 sources from Russia .
Geographer Gerard Toal cites Mikhail Gorbachev twice and Poroshenko only once . That is a far wider problem than merely scholars of Russia, says Toal .
 Scholars writing about the crisis from the perspective of the two books under review can be understood by analyzing their work through ﬁve themes .
 First, blaming the West for the crisis and portraying Russia as a victim, first, blames the West. Second, blames Russia for its crisis and portrays the West as the victim .
 Fifth, downplaying and ignoring Russian nationalism, and exaggerating Ukrainian nationalism . Fourth, downplay and ignore Russian nationalism and exaggerate Ukrainian nationalism.
 Matveeva surprisingly devotes only half a page to the shooting down of MH17 by Russian troops in July 2014 . While devoting an entire page to Russian disinformation denying its involvement in the MH17 shooting down, the page devotes an entirepage to the Russian disinformation
 Russian “neo-revisionism’ was a response to the spread of American exceptionalism and liberalism, Sakwa believes . Russia is a great power, according to Sakwa .
 Sakwa traces the sources of the current crisis to the end of the Cold War . The West did not build an “inclusive peace’ that included Russia, Sakwa says .
 The West is the source of the problem with Russia pushing back against Western hegemonic practices and values . Russia has been pushing back at the West for years .
 Alexander Solznenitsyn complained about a ‘degenerate West’ during his exile in the 1970s and 1980s . He was exiled from the United States in the 1980s and 1970s .
Stephen Hutchings and Vera Tolz write how Eurasianism is a substitute for de-colonization . They say Russia has succeeded in managing ethnic diversity more successfully than the West .
 Eurasianism claims Russia’s values are superior to European, rejects Western political models and embraces the Mongol-Tatar-Eurasian heritage .
 Ukrainian polls show a high majority believe Russia is seeking to destroy Ukraine's sovereignty . The majority of Ukrainians believe Russia wants to destroy Ukrainian sovereignty .
 Both Russian Presidents Borys Yeltsyn and Putin supported hybrid warfare towards the dismembering of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine .
 Russia believes it can be a great power only by controlling, and the West recognizes its sphere of inﬂuence in Eurasia .
 Putin's desire for a ‘grand bargain’ with Donald Trump would recognize Russia as an equal to the United States and Russia’s “privileged zone of interests’ in Eurasia .
 The Russkiy Mir is used to justify an exclusive sphere of inﬂuence beyond the Russian Federation based on culture, values, and language . The Russian Federation has a wide range of cultures and values .
 The “Russian’s sphere of inﬂuence extends, and this includes Ukraine and Belarus . This includes Ukraine, Belarus and Belarus as these are not separate peoples but branches of the ‘Russian people’
 Sakwa and Matveeva seek to downplay Viktor Yanukovych as a friend of Russia . They also seek to minimize Russian pressure upon Ukraine .
 This line of argument ignores or minimizes an entire array of evidence of Russian interference in Ukraine in the decade prior to 2014 .
 Russian intelligence provided paramilitary training to pro-Russian groups . The Donetsk Republic came to power in the November 2014 election with 68.3% of the vote .
 Senior Russian citizens were appointed as his personal bodyguard and Minister of Defense . He is the Chairperson of the SBU and commander of Ukrainian naval forces .
 Russian leaders were never satisﬁed with Ukrainian presidents because they wanted to see a Belarusian-style dominion in Ukraine .
 Russia only had poor relations with Ukraine when it was led by “nationalists’ Kravchuk and Yushchenko is wrong . Russia's relationship with Ukraine is a common misnomer, says CNN's John Sutter .
 Russian diplomats were expelled for supporting extremist pro-Russian and separatist groups . Medvedev's open letter led to his open letter . Russian intelligence trained Donbas and Crimean pro- Russian groups since the Orange Revolution .
 Russian spetsnaz led by Igor ‘Strelkov’ Girkin invaded Ukraine in early April 2014 . Russian volunteers who were trained in Russian camps joined the conﬂict and Russian weapons were being brought into Ukraine before Russia’s full invasion on 24 August
 Ukraine could not have lost so many aircraft and helicopters, and was ultimately defeated at Ilovaysk3 without Russian military assistance . Ukraine was defeated without Russian assistance .
 Following the Minsk 1 agreement, Russia transformed its Donbas proxy groups into a large army with an impressive array of weaponry .
 Evidence of Russia’s massive build up is available from a huge array of oﬃcial sources, think tanks and academic studies .
 Russia blocks expansion of OSCE border mission and its forces prevent SMM from reliably monitoring the border as it sends troops, arms, and supplies into Ukraine . Russia claims it's an ‘internal’ conﬂict and spouting disingenuous arguments about Minsk agreements .
 The DNR 1st Corps and LNR 2nd Corps has a combined 35,000-strong army . The army is bigger than half of NATO's 29 members and could only have been created with Russia’s military assistance .
 Russia sought to extricate itself from the Donbas at the same time as it built up a huge army and military arsenal controlled by GRU oﬃcers and 5,000 Russians .
 Sakwa adds to this denial of Russia’s military support to Donbas proxies by downplaying Russian hacking in the 2016 U.S. elections and Russia's chemical weapons attack in Britain .
Polling data of Ukrainian attitudes to Russian leaders has since become pan-national . There is no better way to view the collapse of Russian soft power than to analyze polling data .
 In 2012, 53% of Ukrainians held a positive view of Putin which by 2016 had collapsed to 10%. By 2016, the number of Ukrainians had fallen to 10% of the population .
 67% of those supporting Ukraine joining the Eurasian Economic Union, 67% held negative views of Russian leaders . 96% were negative, among those supporting EU membership, 96% are negative .
 Joanna Szostek concluded that Russia needs legitimacy, ‘that comes from mass popular acquiescence to the Russian leadership.’
 Widespread opposition to Ukraine adopting the Russian model of development is an outgrowth of Russia associated with ‘cruelty’ and ‘dictatorship’ .7 Re-identiﬁcation of Ukrainians had been taking place slowly up to 2013 .
 In 1996, 50% of Ukrainians supported elevating Russian to an oﬃcial language . The language has declined to 16%.
 The 2012 language law making Russian an oﬃcial language was criticized by the Council of Europe . It has therefore little public support .
 Ethnic Russians made up 17% of Ukraine’s population in the 2001 Ukrainian census, itself a decline from 22 in the 1989 Soviet census .
 The share of the population identifying itself as Ukrainians has increased to 92% . Ukraine is now the fourth most nationally homogenous country in Europe .
 scholars continue to use outdated 1990s stereotypes about a heavily regionally divided Ukraine based on the outcome of the 1994 and 2004 presidential elections . But this problem is decreasing, scholars say .
 Volodymyr Kulyk’s research found ‘sweeping re-identiﬁcation in favor of Ukrainian’ identity since 2014 .
 Ukrainian speakers are less demeaning towards the Ukrainian language . This has not immediately translated into growing numbers of Ukrainian speakers . It has made them more amenable to learning Ukrainian .
 Bilingualism denoted a shift from Ukrainian to Russian-speaking in the USSR . Today that process is reversing with growing numbers of Russian-speakers becoming bilingually Russian and Ukrainian .
 A census and opinion poll shows Ukrainian as one's “native language’s “ native language” in a census and poll .
 Russian speakers are giving Ukrainian as their native language . The change is an indicator where their loyalties lie in the conﬂict .
 Scholars writing from the perspective of ‘Russia the Victim’ are failing to consider these important changes in identity brought on by Russia’s military aggression that have led to the demise of a ‘pro-Russian east’ (Zhurzhenko 2015) and the growth
 Predictions by Western scholars in 1990s of rise of Russian-speaking group identity in Ukraine have not happened . Instead, Russian-speakers have evolved from Soviets into Ukrainians .
 Kulyk adds that a “post-imperial Russian ‘superminority’ in Ukraine has ceased to exist’ While Zhurzhenko concludes that Ukraine’s “pro-Russian east” has shrunk to the Donbas .
 A large body of Western scholars, particularly historians of Russia, view the Crimea as historically Russian . The Crimea has been annexed by Russia .
 The “normality of the Crimea returning to its “natural home” leads Sakwa, Neil Kent, Kaspar de Ploeg and other scholars to take at face value the March 2014 referendum results .
 Crimea and Russia returned the peninsula to its natural home. Kent writes that the “reunion’s’reunion of Crimea and Russian returned the Peninsula to its home .
 Western historians of Russia are not up to speed in the ﬁeld of post-colonialism . They do not interact with their counterparts teaching the history of North America and Australia .
 50,000 were deported from the region in three successive waves in 1942, 1944, and 1949 . One could also include the Greeks as a ‘First Nation’ who had lived in Crimea and the northern Black Sea coast for over a thousand years .
 Ukrainian historiography does not claim ‘First Nation’ status for Ukrainians in Crimea . Russian and surprisingly Western histories of Russia do lay claim to the status of “ first Nation” for Russians .
 Crimea's annexation as a ‘return to normality’ is undertaken by taking sociological data out of context to prove there was always majority support for separatism .
Der Pijl aims to prove Crimea eagerly awaited its “liberation’s’ return to Russia in 2014 . Support for separatism in the Crimea has never been higher than a third of the population, although higher than elsewhere in Eastern and Southern Ukraine .
 Kharkiv had the second highest support after the Crimea and Donbas . Kharkov had 16% support for separatism .
 Two-thirds of the Donbas wished to remain in Ukraine showing that separatism was not backed by a majority of the population anywhere in Ukraine .
 In the Donbas there were the same confused nuances about identity as found by the Razumkov Center in the Crimea .
A majority of Russians, Ukrainians, and Russian-Ukrainians in the Donbas did not support separatism . Elise Giuliano concluded that a majority of Ukrainians, Ukrainians and Russians did not therefore support separatists .
 A similar lack of majority support is found in other areas of Eastern and Southern Ukraine . A similar problem is also seen in other parts of the Ukraine region .
 The takeover of oﬃcial buildings was supported by only 24, 18, and 10% respectively in Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv .
 Pro-Russian separatists could not have taken power and created the DNR and LNR Russian proxy states . Without direct Russian support, pro-Russian protests could not be turned into armed rebellion .
 The 2014 Novorossiya project and 2015 threat of Russia creating a land bridge from the Russian border east of Mariupol to Odesa would have been impossible because of miniscule support in Kherson and Mykolyiv support .
 Sakwa and Matveeva do not provide answers as to why the Novorossiya project was an abysmal failure . Sakwa says it would undermine their “monist” versus “pluralism” framework .
 Russian forces in the Donbas could be classiﬁed as occupation troops because they do not have popular local consent to be present in this territory .
 Sakwa and Matveeva describe the conﬂict as a ‘civil war’ and a leaderless, bottom-up revolt with local roots . The con��ctict is called a "civil war"
 Describing the Donbas conﬂict as a ‘civil war’ is closely correlated to three factors . Describing it as a 'civil war' as a "civil war" is closely linked to the three factors.
 Second, claims that Russian speakers were oppressed or threatened with Ukrainianization . Third, claims Russian speakers had been threatened or oppressed by Ukraine .
 All three claims are either not backed up by evidence or exaggerated by not placing the subject within a comparative context . All three are not backed by evidence, or exaggerated .
 92% identify themselves as ethnic Ukrainian making it more nationally homogenous than Russian Federation, Canada, UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia . All have regional and separatist threats .
 France granted autonomy to Corsica after a violent rebellion . France is the quintessential centralized nation-state . Corsica was granted autonomy after violent rebellion.
 Matveeva writes the Donbas elite were not interested in rebellion . To emphasize a bottom-up revolt, Matveva writes.
 These elites did not support Kyiv either and their neutrality provided a vacuum and window of opportunity for separatists and their Russian backers to step into. Nevertheless, these elites didn't support Kyov either .
 oligarch Rinat Akhmetov was playing both sides between January and April . The Donbas had slipped out from his control, but did he shift to a pro-Ukrainian position .
 If Akhmetov had mobilized workers and coalminers against the rebels they would have been defeated . Akh Metov's government has been accused of corruption in the past .
 In Mariupol in May 2014, Akhmetov brought his workers on the streets and they, together with the Azov battalion, defeated pro-Russian proxies . In May 2014. In April 2014, the Russian army and Azov Battalion, together.
In Kharkiv, Mayor Hennadiy Kernes shifted to a pro-Ukrainian position after discussions with Dnipropetrovsk oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky and following the assassination attempt upon him in late April 2014 .
 The Crimea and Donbas are diﬀerent in that Ukrainians were willing to ﬁght for the Donbas but not for the Crimea . Crimea undermines the exaggerated view of the inﬂuence of Ukrainian nationalism .
 Civilization, rather than language, is a better marker of loyalty in the Russian-Ukrainian war .
Matveeva’s discussion of civilization is confusing as she wrongly deﬁnes it in civic terms as corresponding to Rossiyskie citizens of the Russian Federation .
 The Russkiy Mir is in fact a claim to an alleged commonRusskiy ethno-cultural, religious and historical identity of the three eastern Slavs . It is not civic, it is eth no-cultural and not civic .
 Russia is re-collecting “Russian’s lands that are part of the Russkiy Mir . Russia is a “state-civilization’ and Russia is now a ‘state- civilization”
 In both cases, they are saying Ukraine is a ‘Russian land’ and Ukrainians are a branch of the “Russian people’s” people .
 This historical framework of Russian statehood beginning in Kievan Russia and moving to Vladimir-Suzdal, Muscovy, Russian Empire, USSR and Russian Federation is commonly found in Western histories of Russia and mirroring that used in contemporary Russia .
 Matveeva does not take her discussion of civilization to its logical conclusion of why Ukrainians were divided in their attitudes to the conﬂict .
 The Russkiy Mir is the name of the Russian republics, or Ukraine . It was also known as the Russian Republic, or the Soviet Republic .
 The second division is over whether they look with nostalgia to the Soviet past or with hope to a European future . The first division is the second division, with the second being the third .
 The majority of Ukraine’s Russian speakers have supported Kyiv in the crisis, 60% of Ukrainian troops are Russian speakers . The highest proportion of casualties of Ukrainian security forces are from Russian-speaking Eastern and Southern Ukraine .
 Ukrainians ascribe to language issues as the low level of importance to civil war claims . The language issues are a key factor in undermining claims of a civil war .
 grievances over alleged discrimination against Russian speakers have always been low . In fact, grievances over the alleged discrimination has always been lower .
 Only two percent of Ukrainians are concerned about the protection of the Russian language in Ukraine .
 Matveeva follows Sakwa and other scholars in applying a nationalistic “monism’s mythical framework to the conﬂict. The author says the idea of a nationalism versus Eastern Ukrainian “pluralism” is a “
 Describing pro-Russian proxies in the Crimea as “pluralists’ has no basis in facts on the ground and ignores evidence from scholarly work and human rights organizations .
Nearly two-thirds of Ukrainian troops ﬁghting in the Donbas are Russian speakers17 . Highest number of casualties of security forces are from Eastern and Southern Ukraine .
 Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Churches are banned or severely repressed in the DNR-LNR and Crimea . Second, the largest church in Ukraine until the creation of the autocephalous Church of Ukraine in January 2019 was the Russian Orthodox .
 Ukraine's Jews, who are primarily Russian-speaking, supported the Euromaidan and support Ukraine's side in the war with Russia .
 Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian minorities in the Crimea and DNR-LNR are repressed, their institutions are closed down . Many of their leaders have been forced to ﬂee to Ukraine, imprisoned or exiled .
 Seventy Ukrainian political prisoners are imprisoned in Russia on trumpedup charges . Oleg Sentsov from the Crimea is close to death after a hunger strike .
Russiﬁcation has been re-introduced after the closing down of Ukrainian language schools . Russian language schools have been closed.
Ukrainian history writing has never denied the existence of a Russian people . Russian history routinely denies existence of Ukrainian people .
 Matveeva over-focuses on Ukrainian portrayals of the “Other’s’ othering’ of Ukrainians . The Russian and Donbas rebel ‘Othering” of Ukrainians.
 Nationality policies in the DNR-LNR and Crimea drawing on decades of Ukrainophobia and Tatarophobia can be traced back to the 1930s and 1940s .
 Sakwa and Matveeva could analyze extensive examples of Russian chauvinism and Tatarophobia in Crimea’s most popular newspaper .
Hate language against Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars is propagated by the Crimean and DNR-LNR authorities . It is unprecedented and aggressive.
 Yevhen Mahda lists 21 books published in Russia from 2007-2014 . They disparaged Ukraine and Ukrainians and warned of a pending war .
 An April 2018 Levada Center poll found Ukraine to be second only to the United States in being perceived by Russians as a threat to Russia .
 The ﬁrst claim is not reﬂected in the weak importance of language issues discussed earlier . The second claim is also not re-taken in oﬃcial policies .
 In Crimea, the number of Tatar schools has been reduced from 16 to 7 while all Ukrainian schools have been closed . Ukraine’s government has not retaliated by closing down Russian-language schools .
 If scholars were to look in any media kiosk in Ukraine, they would ﬁnd many more Russian-language than Ukrainian-language newspapers and magazines .
 Freedom House found no ‘national intolerance’ in Ukraine’s media environment . It recorded improvement in media freedoms since 2014 .
 Ukraine’s most popular television channel Inter has always broadcast primarily in Russian, including under Presidents Yushchenko and Poroshenko .
Matveeva’s discussion of de-communization does not provide an understanding of what lies behind the processes . Matveeva's discussion of the process does not give an understanding.
 De-Naziﬁcation was central to Germany’s democratization and Europeanization and de-Communization . Ukraine could be viewed in the same way in Ukraine as Germany .
 One of the four laws honor Ukrainian nationalist partisans in the 1940s . At the same time exclude any military formations under Nazi control .
 One of the laws provides the freest access to Soviet secret police archives anywhere in the former USSR outside the three Baltic states .
 Russia's GPW is a state-sanctioned religion, a cult of Stalin, and downplaying of Soviet crimes against humanity . The GPW's lack of access to archives could be contrasted with Russia's own GPW .
 Russian policies of re-Sovietization and a cult of Stalin have been exported to the DNR-LNR and Crimea . Russia's re- Sovietization policies have been exported to Crimea .
 Matveeva takes at face value the symbols that the Donbas rebels and Russian supporters are promoting . She writes that the Russian Orthodox Church stands at the center of their identity .
 The majority of ROC (until 2018 registered as Ukrainian Orthodox Church) parishes are in Western and Central Ukraine . The Donbas have far fewer Orthodox parishes – as seen in the few Churches found in villages .
 Four Protestant leaders were murdered by Russian occupation forces in Slovyansk .
 Sakwa writes “the genie of Russian nationalism was ﬁrmly back in the bottle’ and distances Putin the pragmatist from Russian nationalists .
 Pål Kolstø and Laruelle write that the nationalist rhetoric of 2014 was novel and subsequently declined . The authors say that the 2014 rhetoric was novel .
 Putin was only a nationalist in 2014, not prior to annexation of Crimea or since 2015 . Hale believes Putin was not a nationalist before annexation of the Crimea .
 Putin was not dependent on Russian nationalism, Sakwa writes . It is debatable whether the word is even applicable to him, he writes .
 Such classiﬁcations are only applied by these scholars to Russian political elites but never to Ukrainians . such classi ﬁCations only applied to the political elites .
Matveeva’s interviews with leaders of the Russian Spring in the Donbas are an original contribution to the scholarly literature . Matveeva's interviews with Russian Spring leaders are a contribution to scholarly literature.
 At the same time, she sidesteps their political aﬃliations because to do so would show that Russian neo-Nazi's and other similar extremists led the Donbas Russian Spring .
 Alexander Borodai and Alexander Prokhanov edited the fascist, Stalinist and imperialist newspaper Zavtra . The newspaper began as Den in 1990 . It is now known as Den .
 Borodai is quoted by Matveeva as saying Russian leaders provided the “organizational, ideological’ support to the Russian Spring.
 Gubarev's and Borodai’s membership of the neo-Nazi RNE is ignored and instead they are described as ‘patriots’ and “conservatives’ While Maveeva denies that Borodi is an ethnic nationalist .
 Sakwa and Matveeva never describe any Russian political leaders a “nationalists’ or “neo-Nazis;’s terms are reserved for Ukrainians .
 Sergei Aksyonov was installed by Russian occupation forces as Crimean Prime Minister . He was the leader of the extreme right-wing nationalist Russian Unity party .
 Aksyonov’s political party espoused an extreme form of Russian chauvinism toward Tatar and Ukrainian minorities . Similar to other Russian nationalists and Cossack groups in a region which has always had high levels of xenophobia .
 Sakwa undertakes academic somersaults to downplay Russia's support for populist-nationalists and neo-Nazi’s in Europe .
 Russian support for fascists, neo-Nazis, Trotskyists, Stalinists, and racists in Europe and the U.S. is ignored as is the hundreds of European populist nationalists and neo- Nazis .
Downplaying nationalism in Russia is coupled with an exaggeration of nationalism in Ukraine . Downplaying nationalism is combined with an exaggeration of nationalism.
 This is unlike Putin who enjoys reading works by Ivan Ilyin, a White émigré and fascist who denied the existence of Ukrainians . This is not unlike Putin, who enjoys working by Ilyin .
 Bandera continues to be buried in Munich, Germany . Ilyin’s remains were brought back by the Russian government and re-buried in Russia . Bander a continues to being buried in Germany .
 Timothy Snyder writes that Ilyin was integrated into Putin’s ideology during his re-election campaign in 2012 . Snyder says Ilyin's chauvinistic views have guided Putin's policies towards Ukraine .
 Ukraine has been accused of using a Soviet deﬁnition of ‘nationalism’ to include anybody who does not want to live in the Russkiy Mir . Such claims depict Ukraine as the negative ‘Other’ by purposefully ignoring many examples of populist nationalists
 If Ukrainian nationalists are understood in the same way as populist-nationalists in Europe, they are unpopular among voters . Ukrainian nationalists failed to be elected in October 2014 .
 Ukraine’s far-right has only won seats in one of seven elections in 2012 . The far-left has won only one seat in the Ukraine's parliamentary elections .
 "Ukrainian nationalists" are opposed to Soviet, Russian and Eurasian values and believing their country to be part of Europe . They represent a larger group, Sakwa, Matveeva and many other scholars .
Russian military aggression is a product of a quarter of a century of evolutionary nation-building and four years of rapid identity change brought on by Russian military aggression . This though, is a result of a 25-year-old century of nation- building and rapid identity changes .
Ukrainian attitudes to Russian citizens and Russian leaders exhibit patriotism – not ethnic nationalism .
 To understand how wrong scholars are exaggerating Ukrainian nationalism, one should compare Ukrainian attitudes to Russian leaders with those of Russian citizens .
 Negative Ukrainian attitudes to Russian citizens is far lower at 22.4%, up slightly from 16.6.6%. Negative attitudes to Russians are far lower than those of Russian citizens .
 Downplaying Russian and exaggerating Ukrainian nationalism leads to the apportioning of blame on Kyiv for the violent conﬂict .
 President Poroshenko is blamed for unleashing a war after he was elected in May 2014 rather than seeking compromise . He is accused of unleashing war after being elected.
 In such an analysis, Putin presumably shares no, or little, responsibility. In such a analysis, he presumably shares little or little responsibility .
 Sakwa and Matveeva both use derogatory terms for Ukrainian nationalists . Both use derogatory term for Ukrainian nationalist groups .
 Matveeva wrongly writes Nazi symbols were commonplace on the Euromaidan . In fact only one then small group, the Social National Assembly/Patriot Ukraine, used them .
 Svoboda party and Pravyy Sektor, two more mainstream nationalist parties, have never used Nazi symbols . They have never been used by Nazi symbols.
 All of these nationalist political parties are electorally unpopular because patriotism – not ethnic nationalism – is dominant in Ukraine . All of the parties are politically unpopular because they are not patriotic .
 When Western scholars use the Soviet and contemporary Russian non-political science deﬁnition of “nationalism, they will see it as dominating post-Euromaidan Ukraine where Russia is rejected .
 Ukraine is one of the weakest electoral results of nationalist parties anywhere in Europe . If “nationalism” is deﬁned in political science understanding of that term it is a weak phenomenon in Ukraine .
Review article has discussed how Western scholars of the former USSR need to get up to speed with the rapid changes taking place in Ukraine and in Ukrainian identity .
 Russian Empire masquerading as the Russian state. It is time for Western historians to write histories of the nation-state in the manner of histories of France, Britain and Italy .
 Historians of Russia should modernize their approach to the Crimea so that it is integrated with historical writing about other postcolonial countries .
 Matveeva is unfortunately right not to be optimistic about an end to the Donbas conﬂict . The Donbas Con�ctict is currently being held in the UK .
 Federalism has always had minimal popular support, including in the Donbas . The Donbas are the most popular in the country .
 Russia's inability to recognize Ukrainian sovereignty and Ukrainians as a separate people is the main barrier to peace . Russia’s inability torecognize Ukrainian sovereignty is the biggest obstacle .
 The question continues to elude most scholars writing on the crisis and war, including in the two books under review .
 Matveeva’s ﬁgure of thousands of Ukrainian dead at Ilovaysk is exaggerated . The Ukrainian government says it has killed more than 1,000 people .
 Interviews conducted in April 2015 in Mariupol with Mariya Podybaylo and Vadym Dzhuvaha of the Novyy Mariupl NGO . Interviews were held in April 2014 .
 A Russian-speaking Ukrainian soldier says that he has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan . He could not believe that something similar could happen to Ukraine .
 He just wants to defend his home and his family from foreign aggressors . He is disinterested in politics and nationalist movements and wants to protect his family .
 Ukraine may have its problems, but it is the responsibility of Ukrainians to resolve them, not Putin . Ukraine may be having problems but not Putin, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The soldier believes if Putin and Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov would take over Ukraine, his children would not have a decent life .
 The law lists the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Ukrainian Insurgent Army alongside many other organizations as ﬁghters for Ukrainian independence .
