 Ukraine has no power to make good on Poroshenko’s threats, they are a clear sign that no will to peace exists in Kiev .
 Petro Poroshenko speaks only when he speaks, few people listen to him .
 Even many supporters of the 2014 coup in Kiev realise that Poroshenko is more of a trigger happy cartoon character than he is the perverse fascist reincarnation of Che Guevara .
 Even though he's been discredited and disgraced as a ‘leader’, his threats cannot be ignored .
 His most recent outburst came when he said that someday the Ukrainian flag will fly over the Russian Republic of Crimea .
 Kiev violated the Minsk agreement shortly after it was ratified . In the same speech he claimed that his flag would also fly in Donbass .
 For some reason western media tends not to notice or report the bizarre treats which regularly emanate from Kiev .
 Poroshenko’s statement combined with a recently foiled terrorist attack on Crimea means that Crimean authorities should be on high alert, says Poroshenko .
 Poroshenko’s rant may just be designed to make a fading leadership appear tough, but in reality, it could be perceived as a not so subtle declaration of war .
 The people of Russia and those in the Donbass republics simply want to be left alone . The people in the Russian republics just want to have been left alone.
 Donbass leadership do not say they want to wave their flags over Mariupol or Odessa . Many in such places would like to detach themselves from Kiev’s rule .
 Putin has consistently called for ceasefires in Donbass when Russian tanks could be in Lviv within days . Likewise, Putin has called for a ceasefire in the region .
 Russian army is fully capable of making any threats Russia might make against Ukraine effective . Whereas Poroshenko’s threats about Crimea are empty bluff, the Russian army can make any threats.
 When you give a clown a gun and remove any trace of a conscience, the laughter ends . The laughter ends when a clown is given a gun .
