 The uprising in Eastern Ukraine was marked by disorganization and chaos . In contrast to Russia’s seizure of Crimea, the uprising is marked bydisorganization .
 Russia sought to institutionalize a political entity inside Ukraine to inﬂuence its domestic politics . Using proxy and surrogate actors, along with military exercises and the injection of Russian troops, Russian troops were used .
 Russia attempted to implement, and later salvage, its strategy, in this article . In this article, I analyze the mechanisms by which Russia tried to implement. I analyze how Russia attempted and later salvaged its strategy .
 The article contributes to clearer theoretical and practical understanding of limited force in coercive diplomacy, signaling, and more rigorous treatment of the role and uses of proxy actors .
 Russian involvement in Ukraine's internal politics has been a constant since the fall of the Soviet Union . Russia's involvement in the internal politics of Ukraine has been constant since fall of Soviet Union. Russia's coercive diplomacy, coercive diplomacy and limited war have been a key factor .
 The Kremlin has taken a keen interest in the fate of Ukraine. Viewed as a critical component of its strategic security, it is unsurprising that the Kremlin is keen on Ukraine .
 Russia's preferred viceroy – Viktor Yanukovych – chased out of the country . A potentiality magniﬁed by Russia’s preferredviceroy - Viktor Yanukovych .
 The well-planned, executed, and rapid seizure of the Crimean Peninsula surprised most observers . The new regime in Kiev, along with the new regime, surprised many observers .
 There is a large and wide-ranging debate over the sources of Russian conduct in Ukraine .
 Crimea operation was conducted by the best of a reequipped Russian military . An incipient insurgency soon emerged in eastern Ukraine with Russian support .
 The Donbas was an amalgamation of contradiction and confusion, led by local power brokers, criminals, and ‘volunteers’ from across the postSoviet space .
 Russia sought to create mechanisms that would allow it to negate any further Ukrainian drift toward the West . It sought to ensure that it retained veto power over any future negotiations . Instead of seeking to acquire further Ukrainian territory, Russia sought a mechanism that would let it to negoti
 Russia could be manipulated by Russia to inﬂuence Ukrainian domestic politics . Russia could avoid using more overt, external forms of pressure .
 The Kremlin entertained a level of hubris and viewed Ukraine’s eastern regions as an opportunity ripe to allow Russia to institutionalize its inﬂuence permanently . Buoyed by the weakened political situation and nonexistent resistance encountered during its seizure of the Crimean Peninsula, the Kremlin

 The demands were opaque and confusing in the initial stages, only becoming clearer as the conﬂict progressed . However, these demands are opaque and confused in the first stages .
 The limited use of force was a key component of Russia’s coercive diplomacy strategy . Russia's coercive diplomacy is a key part of its strategy .
 It is clear that this strategy evolved over time and was subject to adjustment and revision as the conﬂict progressed . It is also clear that the strategy evolved.
 Large-scale military exercises near Ukraine’s border to increase concern of a Russian military invasion .
 The use of non-state actors, including organized crime, is supported and directed by Moscow to give the appearance of a local rebellion .
 Russia is a nationalistic Slavic narrative propagated by Russia . This included mercenaries and ideologically motivated volunteers – fostered by the Russian government .

 In particular, the reliance on illicit NSA’s was crucial to Russian strategy . In particular.
 Illicit NSAs were turned into insta-patriots, allowing Russia to argue for the insurgency as a domestic rebellion . Russia has provided a rapid and deployable force already on the ground .
 The low cost and deniability of illicit NSAs came with drawbacks, including decreased control and eﬀectiveness .
 This article seeks to analyze and understand Russia’s coercive diplomacy and its deployment of limited military force in Eastern Ukraine .
 Russia’s actions were ad hoc and improvised, driven as much by success in Crimea and developments on the ground as by strategic plans .
 Russia’s signaling eﬀorts were confused, muddled, and misinterpreted, Russia says . Russia injected its own troops to forcefully pushback Ukrainian advances .
 It seeks to map out the use of illicit NSAs as a tool of coercive diplomacy and the drawbacks of their use . It also seeks to find out the benefits and drawbacks of the NSAs .
 This is crucial to advance the understanding and relationship of limited uses of force and coercive diplomacy as measures short of war . This is important to advance a limited use of force, coercive diplomacy, says David Cameron .
First, I examine the literature on coercive diplomacy and the limited use of force . First, I examined the literature of coercive diplomacy .
 Russia's use of illicit NSAs in support of coercive diplomacy. Second, I construct an analytical framework to analyze and understand Russia’s use of NSAs .
 The conclusion summarizes the ﬁndings and draws out implications on signaling, coercive diplomacy, and the use of illicit NSAs by states by states .
 Coercive diplomacy seeks to prevent or alter an actor’s course of action without resorting to full-scale use of force . Coercives diplomacy and limited use of military force is sought to prevent an actor's actions .
 As a strategy, it signals that the proposed beneﬁts of an action, or continuing action, are outweighed by the costs . The proposed action is a strategy.
 The tools to convey this signal include limited uses of force, including nonmilitary measures of coercion such as economic sanctions .
 The line dividing the limited use of force and full-scale war remains underspeciﬁed . However, the line dividing force and war remains underpeci.
 This line becomes even more complicated with issues of attribution, where actors retain a veil of deniability, even if only formally . The line becomes more complicated.
 Inadequate operationalization and deﬁnition of many terms have further complicated scholars’ ability to understand these issues . Inadequated operationalization of many term has further complicated scholar’s understanding of these issues.
 Open-Qualitative judgments have reduced its deﬁnition to an ‘I-Know-It-When-ISee-It’ status .
 Key in use of limited force is the risk of escalation to greater war. Key in the use oflimited force is risk of greater war, according to the U.S.
 The sender seeks to force its opponent to reassess its plans in light of a credible signal of further conﬂict .
 Alexander George later diﬀerentiated compellence from coercive diplomacy to emphasize the role of positive inducements in achieving compliance . Alexander George was later known for his role as a diplomat .
 The ‘oﬀensive/defensive’ debate obscures the variation in actor perception of status quo vs. status quo .
 The Limits of Coercive Diplomacy, 29, is a book by Alexander George and William E Simons . The book is titled ‘ Theory and Practice in History,’
 The Limits of Coercive Diplomacy and Characteristics are written by Alexander George and William E Simons . They are also written by William E. Simons and Alexander George .
 Ukrainian successes during late summer of 2014 was viewed as an attempt to alter the status quo . In the West, Russia’s actions – from Crimea to the Donbas – were revisionist attempts to alter security system in Europe .
 As a result, deﬁning ‘defensive’ can quickly become bogged down in a semantic haze . It can be difficult to understand what is being said by a person .
 Others such as Robert Art and Patrick Cronin identify a more expansive understanding to include both its exemplary and limited use .
 To distinguish between coercive and full-scale use of force, attention should be on evaluating whether force is being used in order to signal or bring about a decisive conclusion . To clarify these debates, the author says .
 Whether force is being used to signal nevertheless remains contingent upon the clarity of the signal that the coercer seeks to convey .
 Schelling: There is a range of possible outcomes, but there needs to be an obvious place to stop . As Schelling argued, there is a variety of possible outcome, but it needs to stop.
 When using covert or secretive methods the place to stop becomes much less obvious . However, when using covert and secretive methods, it becomes much more obvious .
27 the ability of states to communicate in secret and the beneﬁts of doing so are the focus of a small but growing literature .
 States can signal through the ‘backstage,’ allowing actors with the capability to access the backstage to receive signals .
 interpreting signals through the backstage runs into the same conceptual issues as signaling publicly . The assumption that viewing a signal results in the correct interpretation is incorrect .
 In order to be taken seriously, signals have to be credible, but there is no guarantee that the receiver agrees with the sender of what qualiﬁes as credible .
 The ‘noise’ of a conﬂict presents inordinate information processing requirements on states and policymakers, making it diﬁlter out intentional signals from other unintentional information .
 The diﬃculty of which is increased with the introduction of proxy and covert actors, since the receiver is unsure the extent of control by the sender over the proxy actors .
 The use of proxies is as old as conﬂict itself, with states coopting and manipulating actors for their own beneﬁt. State subcontractors use proxies to manipulate state actors .
 Almost all civil wars have a transnational component of some sort, including state support for belligerent groups . The U.S. military has been involved in some of the most recent civil wars .
 Some have noted the utility of using proxy forces and NSAs as a form of coercion . Byman and Waxman and Navin Bapat are among those to use NSAs .
 This is a crucial oversight as the divide between the politically and materially motivated is malleable and easily traversed . This is an important oversight, says the author of the book .
 The organized crime boss of today is the insta-patriot and freedom ﬁghter of tomorrow . He is the organized crime leader of today .
 Since war is a costly endeavor, the use of proxies can be an attractive alternative to war . Use of proxies is an attractive option, according to the author .
 By subcontracting out coercion, a state can reduce its potential costs, both materially and politically . State can reduce potential costs by subcontracting to a state .
 By using an NSA, ‘volunteers’ can gain a veneer of legitimacy by presenting the group as a ‘domestic’ actor .
 Since the extent and level of support and control is most likely unclear, the coercing state can circumvent a level of blame and criticism . It's not clear how much control the state can have .
 Proxies also provide local knowledge that otherwise may be lost on a foreign force . Proxie also provide information that otherwise could be lost.
 Local actors can exploit their preexisting knowledge of local political and patronage relations along with their connections to the local community . Local actors are able to exploit their knowledge of their connections with the community .
 An additional beneﬁt is the speed with which these groups or actors can be activated . The speed is also the speed of groups and actors who can beactivated .
 Not only low cost, many illicit actors can be quickly transformed into an armed force, many can be transformed into armed force .
 The Russian seizure of Crimea was in large part assisted and enabled by local organized crime ﬁgures. The seizure was in big part assisted by organized crime, according to reports .
 Sergei Aksyonov (AKA the 37 Byman and Waxman, Dynamics of Coercion, 117. The most prominent example is the current prime minister of the Crimean Republic, Sergei AKSyonov .
 With the decrease in cost and increase in deniability comes a loss of control and precision. With the increase in cost, there is a loss in control of precision and control .
 The actor has an individual set of preferences that at some point will pull or contrast with that of his employer . This is in part because the actor itself has a set of preference for his own employer .
 In terms of signaling, it can lead to confusion over the sincerity of signals and questions over what is attributable to the sponsor vs. the local actor .
 The control, or leverage, over the proxy actor is a determining factor in the ability of the sponsor to calibrate and direct the activities of its proxy . The control of a sponsor's proxy is a deciding factor in how much it can influence its activities .
 The agent can engage in activities that undermine or distract from the ultimate goal of the sponsor . Because of shirking, or incompetence, the agent can do anything that undermines or distract the sponsor.
 Being reliant on the sponsor for supplies, funding, and safe haven all increase the control of the sponsor over the proxy . Being reliant for supplies and funding increases control of a sponsor over a proxy .
 The sponsor can ensure greater alignment of interests by placing preferred personnel in key positions, not to mention structuring the group’s rationale and purpose .
 This increases the risks of clear and obvious connections to the sponsor, diminishing deniability . However, this also increases the risk of clear, obvious connections with the sponsor .
 As a result, there is a fundamental tension between control and deniability . There is also a tension between Control and Deniability .
In order to achieve increased control, the principal has to exert more eﬀort and resources, resulting in higher visibility .
 Concerns over deniability and control are over the actual capability to achieve objectives . Other concern is over the real capability of achieving objectives .
 Proxy groups are usually – at least initially – disadvantaged in relation to government forces . proxy groups are often disadvantaged in connection with government forces, such as the government .
 proxy group’s ability to decisively engage and defeat conventional security forces is less than certain . A proxy group is able to degrade and harass, a proxy group's ability to defeat conventional forces is not certain .
 This is not only due to resources, but also command, control, and professionalism . This is due to the professionalism of the staff and resources .
Security forces face fractious and underfunded security forces . However, this is not a great concern when facing fractious or underfunded forces .
 The International Studies Perspectives is based on StateSponsored Terrorism’s analysis of terrorism . It is based in the United States .
 Bruce B Campbell and Arthur D Brenner were both killed in the Bosnian War . They were killed by Serbian Paramilitaries.
 In order to face oﬀ against conventional security forces, the proxy’s capabilities have to be increased .
 Increased capability comes at raising the visibility of the sponsor’s role in upgrading the proxy . This increased capability comes as the sponsor's role has been increased .
With increased deniability comes decreased outcome dominance and vice versa . Thus, with increasedDeniability comes increased outcome dominance .
 proxy actors are often indecisive if not utilized in conjunction with – or in support of – other coercive strategies . As a primary strategy for obtaining conventional goals, proxy actors can be indecisive .
 Russia and coercive diplomacy in Eastern Ukraine, this article uses process tracing to evaluate Russia’s words and deeds . To understand Russia's use of coercive diplomacy.
In particular, I seek to gain a better understanding of why particular tools and strategies were chosen at particular points in the conﬂict . In particular, he seeks to gain an understanding of what caused an adjustment.
 Russia saw opportunity to take advantage of the confusion and weakness of the new Ukrainian regime and its decrepit military .
 The Kremlin sought to leverage this instability and create a situation in which the pro-Russian regions had an institutionalized ability to inﬂuence Kiev . Concerned by the expansion of NATO and the EU, the Kremlin sought a more permanent solution .
 Kiev was gradually able to consolidate a level of political and military capacity . However, what was initially envisioned as an attainable next step, quickly escalated .
 What began as a strategy to force Ukraine to recognize a new political status for the East, eventually devolved into ﬁghting to prevent a decisive Ukrainian victory over the separatist regions .

 These snap exercises served as a distraction to provide cover for the insertion of military forces into Crimea . The exercises were designed to provide a distraction for military forces .
 Kiev exercises served as a credible signal to Kiev that any forceful response to the Crimean operation could lead to further escalation and outright invasion in the East .
 snap exercises transitioned from providing cover for large movement of troops to giving Kiev pause from fully committing all its forces to quelling the incipient ‘grassroots’ rebellion in the East .
 The Russian Federation Council gave Putin the authority to use troops in Ukraine on March 1 . The council also gave him permission to use forces in Ukraine .
 Russia faced almost nonexistent resistance during its Crimea operation . Only 6,000 men were available out of a ground force of 41,000 . Russia's force structure remained largely unchanged from the Soviet military .
 BOWEN majority of its forces situated in the West for an eventual confrontation with NATO . In reality, Russia did not maintain the necessary forces to sustain and occupy large portions of the country .
 Russia's force of capable and deployable soldiers had been largely exhausted . Russia's primary concern is shoring up its hold on Crimea .
 instability among the new regime, along with the Ukrainian military, provided an opportunity for the Kremlin to capitalize on feelings of disenfranchisement, especially among the primarily Russian speaking regions . However, instability among new regime provided opportunity for Kremlin.
 Russia continues to deny any designs on invasion. Yet, despite the buildup, Russia continued to deny plans on invasion .

 Moscow realized in the run up to the Presidential elections of 25 May that its threat of military invasion was ineﬀective . Moscow realized the threat of a military invasion in the running up to 25 May.
 In part, this was due to the unstable and fragmented political situation in Kiev, heavily inﬂuenced by nationalist and right leaning forces that had protested .
 Russia was either unwilling or unable to commit to a large-scale invasion of the East – in part due to little desire to annex the economically depressed region . It also became clear that Russia waseither unwilling or unwilling to commit. to an invasion.
 There also became a point of diminishing capability, as Russian units near the border had to be rotated out to resupply . Other conscripts as other conscript terms expired .
 By May, most of the units had been in the ﬁeld for 4 months . Fighting capacity begins to diminish when a unit leaves its barracks .

 A focus of the modernization campaign was increasing the level of contract soldiers and creating permanent readiness brigades . The modernization campaign is aimed at creating a permanent readiness brigade .
 The eﬀorts had achieved limited success by the time of the Ukraine crisis . Contract recruitment was below target levels, and only one battalion in each brigade was designated permanent readiness .

Several thousand Marched in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine carrying the ﬂag of the previously unknown ‘Donetsk Republic’ and demonstrating against the new regime .
 Gradually protests began to spread throughout the Eastern Regions of Ukraine, seizing police and government buildings .
Support for the protestors reﬂected a deep-seated fear that was easily capitalized on by external forces . Worried about their status and the new regime, support for the protesters re-exerted a fear .
 Fear compounded by weakness of the local security and police forces, says police chief .
 Most were lackluster in opposing the protests and many, such as Aleksander Khodakovsky, eventually sided with the local separatists .
 It soon became clear that many protestors were associated with various fringe movements and local organized crime ﬁgures . Many of these protestors are associated with fringe movements.
 Russia’s supporting hand was evident from the beginning. While representing a real, local sense of concern, Russia's supporting hand is evident .
 The objective was to force Kiev to negotiate with the separatists and agree to a settlement that gave the East a greater advantage in its relations with Kiev .

 The Kremlin and its local surrogates overestimated their ability to turn local resentment toward Kiev into support for Russia and its project .
Out of the eight Oblasts of Ukraine with large populations of ethnic Russians, separatists were only able to gain appreciable traction in Donetsk and Luhansk .
 Initially, relatively unknown locals such as Pavel Gubarev and Aleksandr Kharitonov became self-described governors . Both were soon arrested by the SBU in mid-march .
 The leadership question was very unclear during this period, as various ‘people’s’ mayors, governors or the like popped up wherever the separatists gained ground .

 Examining Support for Separatist Geopolitcal Imaginary in Southeast Ukraine’, Post-Soviet Aﬀairs .
 The siren song of Slavic nationalism attracted ﬁghters from across the post-Soviet world .
 Many were directed to Ukraine by opaque organizations or ﬁxers, supported by a trenchant stream of Kremlin directed propaganda .
 Especially during the beginning of May, the separatists started gaining in capability, which stymied Ukrainian progress .
 The Luhansk People’s Republic was established on 27 April . Using momentum gained, it was established by using momentum gained .
 Kiev began to stabilize itself, sending reinforcements along with creating local volunteer forces to supplement the overstretched Ukrainian army .
 Statements from the Kremlin and the FM continued to call for a Ukrainian withdrawal and a political dialogue .
 For Russia, the foremost goal was to emphasize that it was, at most, an arbiter in an internal Ukrainian conﬂict .
 By forcing Kiev to negotiate directly with the separatists, they would legitimize them and Russia’s role as arbiter .
 Moscow hoped that by presenting an image of lack of control over the separatists, it would increase pressure on Kiev to come to a quick agreement . Moscow hopes that the image of the separatists would increase the pressure on the Kiev government .
 Volunteer Battalions in Post-Maidan Ukraine’s, Instituto Aﬀari Internazioinali .
 The most public display of a ‘rift’ was the deﬁance of the separatists to delay their referendum despite Putin’s pleas .
 The two republics signed an agreement establishing Novorossiya, referring to the old Czarist administrative region covering most of East and Southern Ukraine . Shortly thereafter in a propaganda move to increase nationalist support.
 In wake of referendum vote, Moscow realized it needed to organize some hierarchical control . Moscow has been in power since 2008 .
 The DNR began to formulate its leadership, with Alexander Borodai being ‘elected’ PM, Igor Strelkov its Defense Minister, and Denis Pushilin the speaker of parliament .
 The most pressing problem was corralling the various warlords and armed groups that had been created .
 At the end of May, a coordinated rebel attack temporarily dislodged Ukrainian forces from Donetsk International Airport, but was repulsed with heavy losses . The attack was a coordinated effort to dislodge Ukrainian forces.
 It stormed the headquarters of the Donetsk Separatists and took control . It publicly re-emerged May 29th when it stormed the HQ .
 The core of the unit initially appeared to be veterans of the old unit . It quickly transitioned into an amalgamation of nationalities, led by Aleksander Khodakovsky .
 Moscow realized the anarchy it had fostered was beginning to turn into a liability . It appears that Moscow realized that the anarchy its fostered had begun to become a liability.
 Warlords, gangs, and paramilitary units had begun inﬁghting and operating with little oversight or much regard for the political goals of the rebellion .
 In response, an instrument was needed that was deniable but cohesive enough to give Moscow greater control over the separatists . In response to the separatists, Moscow was given greater control.
 Vostok’s origins, composition, and support could lead to little conclusion other than Russian patronage . However, it was clear that this increase in control came with a loss of deniability .
 Borodai agreed to Poroshenko’s oﬀer of a 4-day ceaseﬁre, but the fractious nature of the various militia groups meant that it was soon violated .
 This not only endangered the cease-ﬁre but Moscow’s negotiating positions as well . This not just endangered the ceasefire but Moscow's negotiating positions .
 The fragmented nature of political and military structures in the East contrasted with an increasingly cohesive Ukrainian government eﬀort . The fragmentation of the East contrasts with the increasingly cohesive Ukraine government .
 Ukraine gradually consolidated its forces and pushed into separatist territory . With Poroshenko elected, Ukraine gradually consolidation its forces .
 Strelkov was forced to abandon Slavyansk, and rebel leaders made increasingly public, and embarrassing, pleas for intervention from Russia . By 5 July, the rebel leader had been forced to leave Slavansk .
 Moscow realized that it needed to make further changes to restore order in the insurgency . Moscow realized it needs to make more changes to restored order .
 Vladimir Antyufeyev was responsible for setting up the breakaway republic of Transnistria . He will replace Alexander Khodakovsky as head of the republic’s security services .
 The three most visible leaders of the separatist movement were now Russian citizens . All with varying degrees of connection to the intelligence services of Russia .
 Moscow understood that the most important goal was to solidify and stabilize the leadership and regain control of the rebellion . Despite the negative optics of now being a Russian led rebellion.
 Malaysian Air ﬂight MH17 was shot down by an SA-11 Buk Missile on 17 July . The situation became dire when Malaysian Air was shotdown by the separatists .
 Russia launched a largescale propaganda smoke screen that ranged from denial to providing poorly doctored photos of a Ukrainian jet shooting down the airliner .
 Alexander Khodakovsky admitted to the SA-11 being under rebel control in that area . It was sent back to Russia immediately afterward to hide its presence . The most pointed example of separatist guilt was provided by the Russian politician .
 The downing of MH17, combined with the Ukrainian ATO successes, meant Russia was quickly losing maneuver room . Russia was quick to lose maneuver room after MH17's downing .
 Kiev boasted that separatist’s territory was 2. times smaller than four weeks previously . More than 65 towns and villages were liberated, with more than 65 cities and villages liberated .
Despite the proliﬁc amounts of weapons and facilitation of ‘volunteer’ ﬁghters, the separatists were unable to stem Ukrainian advances. BOWEN clearer by the day .
 The 'Novorossiya' rebellion would end in defeat, it was becoming clear . Russia has been taking action against the rebels .
 Moscow’s two goals for the separatists were to force Kiev to negotiate directly with the separatists . By early August, Moscow had seemed to fail to build up the separatist's capability .
 The allRussian leadership of the republics made it impossible for Ukraine to negotiate with the separatists . The all Russian leadership made it difficult for Ukraine for the separatists.
 The still fragile domestic political situation, along with the heavy reliance on nationalist ideology for political and military support, precluded any negotiated settlement with separatists . The situation is still fragile.
 The Kremlin realized that for any long-term settlement to be reached, the leadership had to regain a Ukrainian image . As a result, the Kremlin realized it would have to regain the Ukrainian image.
Both Strelkov and Borodai resigned from their posts in August . Both were replaced by long time DPR military commander Aleksander Zakharchenko .
 The separatists held elections in early November . They sought to legitimize the leadership of the republics and increase their bargaining position .
 This was part of the Russian eﬀort to turn the disparate separatist’s movement and republics into functioning bureaucratic entities . This was one of the most successful attempts to transform the separatist movement into a functioning bureaucracy .
 Another key objective was to reorganize and coordinate the disparate forces of the republics, along with reigning in the more independent minded commanders .
 Especially the Cossack commanders in Luhansk, were either brought into the fold or eliminated . The Cossacks were either eliminated or brought in the fold .
 Many challenged the Russian decreed leadership, either because of their own hubris or over lucrative illicit rackets . Many challenge the Russian government's leadership, or because of its own hubries .

 Ukrainian forces launched eﬀorts to surround Donetsk and cut the border with Russia . Despite the support, Ukrainian forces built on their momentum and launched e ﬀort .
 By the middle of July it was becoming increasingly clear to the Kremlin that the separatists and military exercises were insuﬃcient .
 Ukrainian forces took Debaltseve, a strategically important rail hub, on 27 July . They were making advances toward Shaktyorsk, another highway route from Luhansk to Donetsk .
 Russia built up large amounts of troops and equipment on the border. In response, Russia built a large amount of troops, equipment and troops .
 Russian MoD admitted to be active members of the 98th Airborne Division . But they had become 'lost' patrolling the Russian side of the border .
 As more and more Russian troops became involved in direct action, the narrative shifted from denying their presence to cultivating a proper frame to argue for their presence .
 Russian troops were killed under mysterious circumstances, often after serving in units that were deployed close to the Ukrainian border . This narrative was also required due to the increasing domestic visibility of Russian troops being killed .
 Russian troops in Ukraine were there of their accord and on vacation from their units . Despite support, it became clear that to blunt Ukrainian progress and reverse the trajectory of the conﬂict, Russian forces were required .
 Since the middle of August, the intensity of combat picked up, and by the end of the month, Ukrainian forces began to be pushed back across the region .

 Ukrainian forces were pushed back, including from Ilovaisk where they attempted to break out of the encirclement, known as the kotel, were ambushed, suﬀering heavy losses .
 The threat of Russian invading and occupying larger swath of the country was never higher than at this point . The threat was never greater than at the time .
 Putin laid out a seven-point ceaseﬁre plan during a call between Putin and Poroshenko . Putin and the separatists agreed to a potential cease-in-a-cease.
 In the wake of the ceaseﬁre, the conﬂict maintained a relative calm, punctuated by occasional outbursts of ﬁghting and artillery exchanges .
 All sides had removed some equipment and forces from the frontlines . There was even a recognition that all sides had taken some equipment.
 Each side probed and jockeyed for political position in negotiations . With ﬁghting muted, each side probes and joces for political positions .
 Ukraine's President Poroshenko visited the United States Congress to plead for lethal weapon aid . The Association Agreement with the EU was signed, a new parliament was elected at the end of October .
 Russia did not overtly intervene and send in ‘peacekeeping’ forces to demarcate permanently new territorial boundaries . Despite progress on energy and political negotiations, Poroshenko and the administration made stringent statements of being prepared for ‘total war'
 Russia wanted a ‘hundred percent guarantee’ that NATO would not oﬀer Ukraine membership, Dmitry Peskov said in November .
 The Obama administration seemed to harden with the unanimous passing of the Ukraine Support Act of on 19 December 2014 . By the end of December, all sides realized the need for a negotiated, if temporary, settlement .
 The credibility of Russian signals became clear with the injection of Russian forces . Russian forces have been injected into Russia by the military .
 The jockeying continued throughout January and the beginning of February, as it seemed that Russia was intent on probing Western support .
 The United States agreed to a $2 billion loan to Ukraine and the EU extending sanctions . The U.S. agreed to the loan, along with cancelling a round of talks in Minsk, on 30 January .
 Donetsk Airport and the rail hub at Debaltseve would be far too costly for Russia to resupply and support the republics, not to mention their symbolism .
On 21 January, the Airport was seized by the separatists with support from Russian forces . The airport was seized on 21 January by separatists .
 Ukraine comes under Russian artillery in Luhansk and a separatist oﬀensive near Mariupol . After the seizure, jockeying continued between both sides .
 Russian attention was focused on Debaltseve, a key connection between Donetsk and Luhansk . The increase in the number of troops, artillery, tanks, and sophisticated jamming equipment engaging Ukrainian forces .
 Russian forces closed in around Debaltseve, threatening another kotel . It was clear that a last push was underway before the agreement was signed .
 Stiﬀ resistance prevented Russia and the separatists from seizing it in time . As the guns went quiet along the frontlines, they remained active in Debaltseve .
 Putin tried to delay the implementation of the ceaseﬁre for 10 days in order to allow for the capture of the rail hub .
 The Kremlin was willing to risk the entire agreement. So crucial was the hub to Russian plans that the Kremlin would risk the whole agreement .
 Putin stated that the conﬂict over the town was understandable but that, ‘to lose is always painful but life is life.’
 The manuscript presents both an empirical study of Russia’s strategy in the Donbas and investigating the role of force in coercive diplomacy, proxy actors, and signaling .
 The Russian use of coercive diplomacy in Eastern Ukraine was primarily driven by a perceived opportunity to capitalize on the weakened political and military situation in Ukraine . The use of coercion was mainly driven by the perceived opportunity for the country to take advantage of the weakened military situation .
 The failure of Ukraine to present any semblance of coherent resistance to the Russian takeover of Crimea incentivized the Kremlin to press for continued gains . The failure to present a semblance of cooperation with Russia incentivised the Kremlin.
 Russia overestimated resentment in the region, and underestimated the resolve of the fractious Ukrainian government . Russia sought a long-term mechanism of inﬂuence in a strategically crucial buﬀer zone between itself and NATO .
 Russia’s strategy for coercive diplomacy was subject to revision, adjustment, and compromise as methods were either rebuﬀed or insu ﬃcient to coerce Ukraine .
 Russia sought negotiations to convince Ukraine to accept a new political arrangement that allowed it to retain the regions, albeit with less control .
 Russia intended to negotiate an end to the conﬂict, says the author . Russia's military overtures, combined with the limited and bounded injection of Russian troops, support the argument .
 A frozen conﬂict would be detrimental to Russian objectives by saddling it with an economically depressed region – on top of Crimea . The Ukrainian government failed to achieve its original goal of institutionalizing a mechanism of in�ctuence inside Ukraine .
 The combination of NSAs and snap exercises created a signiﬁcant amount of pressure on Kiev, but were unsuccessful in achieving Russia's goals .
 Russian troops were used to demonstrate the clarity and credibility of Russian intentions . Ultimately, it took the direct injection of Russian troops to demonstrate Russian intentions.
 Russia’s use of force was demonstrative, and not intended to achieve a decisive outcome . However, Russia's use of Force was demonstrable, and it was not meant to achieve an outcome .
 As a result, instead of focusing on the level or intensity of the use of force, greater attention should be paid to its goal .

 force was used as a signaling mechanism by Russia, it is clear . It is clear that in Ukraine, force was use as a signalling mechanism .
 Russian signaling was subject to confusion and limited the ability of both sides to come to a negotiated settlement . Russia's proxies and indirect methods of coercion were used to negotiate a settlement .
 Russian signals, despite being visible to audiences with access to the ‘backstage,’ were unclear at many stages of the con .
 Russia's use of proxy actors complicated the ability of target audiences to discern clearly Russian intentions and level of commitment in the crisis . Russia’s use of proxies complicated the able of target audience to discern Russian intentions .
 Russian signals became clearer as resources and involvement were increased beyond previous thresholds . It remained unclear whether greater Russian involvement and risk tolerance was directed toward tactical developments on the ground .
 The study demonstrates that covert signaling remains a complicated and confusing endeavor, especially when using proxy actors and questions remain concerning control and involvement, despite being visible to particular audiences .
 Ukraine's separatists proved to be as much of a hindrance to Russia as Russia as Ukraine . In addition, the disparate and fractious nature of the separatists themselves ultimately proved to prove to be a hinderrance .
 Russia was able to retain a level, no matter how tenuous, of deniability and present a narrative of the conﬂict as an internal con� con�ctict .
 Agency loss and ineﬃciency gradually created a liability rather than asset . However, it also resulted in a lack of control and eﬀectiveness, as the agency loss and  ine� lack of control and ine
 Russia's experience demonstrates that managing the level of control relative to deniability is a fundamental attribute of using proxies . Russia’s experience shows that managing level of Control relative to Deniability is an important attribute .
 proxy forces are often unable to achieve decisive outcomes against a more conventional, coherent force when not employed in conjunction with other coercive strategies . proxy forces can be attractive due to their low cost and deniability .
 Research should increasingly incorporate the varying motivations of proxies to include materially motivated actors such as organized criminals .
 To proxies, political allegiance is often a fungible asset, motivated by immediate opportunity and gain as much as righteous political fervor . To proxy political allegiance, political action is often an opportunity for political action .
 Russia's various ad hoc and improvised adjustments had failed to achieve the initial Russian objectives . By the end of the conﬂict, Russia’s various Ad hoc and improvisations had failed.
 Russia was faced with either intervening to stave oﬀ a complete rebel defeat, or to accept failure . Russia was facing either intervening or accepting failure .
 Russia chose a third option of limited intervention to prevent a separatist defeat . Ultimately, Russia chose the third option to prevent the separatist defeat.
 As a result, the best the Kremlin could hope for was a recognized stalemate . The Kremlin's best hope for is a recognition of a stalemate.
