 There is no candidate expressing the people power of the Euromaidan movement of 2014–2015. What is disappointing is that there is no candidates expressing people power .
 The main candidates are two well-worn establishment candidates and a maverick . The main candidate is a well- worn establishment candidate .
 Zelenskiy is a showman, comic, and businessman with no political experience . The major story of the election is the meteoric rise in the polls of the candidate .

 Russia intervened militarily, first in Crimea and then in Donbas . That changed in 2014 when Yanukovych discredited himself and fled, and Russia intervened .
 Five million people in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, who voted in previous elections, won’t have a chance to cast their ballots in this one . That means that the blue voters no longer have a strong party to vote for, and upward of five million people.
 There are undoubtedly voters who are unhappy about the post-Euromaidan, pro-Western political agenda of the past few years .

 Moscow is likely to harm the candidates in the Ukrainian elections . It is hard for the Kremlin to influence the elections, since any support from Moscow would harm candidates .
 Campaigns are geared more toward this fall’s parliamentary elections .
There is no question that the Kremlin might benefit from Poroshenko’s loss . There is no doubt that the Russian government might benefit.
 Moscow hopes that the Ukrainian government could be destabilized or weakened during a transition of power . The Ukrainian government is currently in power.
 Tymoshenko has a history of interactions with Vladimir Putin, and Zelenskiy is inexperienced . Zelenkiy has been in contact with Putin for years .

 The question is whether the Ukrainian politicians are willing to curb their ambitions if they lose and concede gracefully . The Kremlin will like anything that might sow chaos in Ukraine.
 The Kremlin doesn't have a favorite among the serious candidates in the Ukrainian presidential election . The Kremlin does not have afavorite among theserious candidates in Ukraine .
 Moscow is somewhat consoled by the fact that Poroshenko has run his campaign under the slogan “Army, Language, Faith,’’s ‘Army, language, Faith’ The slogan has stolen votes from other candidates with a nationalist or patriotic agenda .
 Ukraine's next leader won't advocate an even more radical split with Russia than the current one . That is at least a guarantee that Ukraine’s next leader will not advocate a radical split .
 The hope in Moscow is not that a pro-Russian party will win, as this is impossible now . The hope is that a peace party will be able to win, or that a political party will lose .
 The hope in Moscow is that a party of pragmatists, who believe that you have to do business with Russia, if only because of its geographical proximity, will win .
 If Poroshenko loses the election, it will look like a victory for this sort of party. If he loses, it would look like an election victory for theoshenko party .
