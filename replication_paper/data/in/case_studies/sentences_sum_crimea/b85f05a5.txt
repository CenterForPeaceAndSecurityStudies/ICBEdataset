 Special attention is given to the religious policies of the post-Euromaidan political regime in Ukraine .
 UOC-MP is the largest confession of Ukraine in terms of its religious network . It has stood in opposition to the ideological line of the Ukrainian state regarding the interpretation of events in Crimea and Donbas .
 Since the beginning of the 2000s, religion has enjoyed growing visibility in the public sphere of Ukraine . Since the start of the 1990s, the country has seen growing visibility of religion .
 The Euromaidan protests took place between November 2013 and February 2014 . The highest point of this process was when religious organisations openly endorsed resistance to the state in their public discourses .
 The events that followed the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and the violent military conﬂict in East Ukraine,2 have presented churches with new, sometimes more signiﬁcant opportunities for socio-political involvement .
 religious leaders have continued to maintain an extensive public presence in general and in the secular media in particular . In the period after February 2014, religious leaders are seen to have maintained a large public presence .
 People need psychological support and messages of reassurance in times of emotional distress and everyday tragedy, says psychologist .
During the Euromaidan, the discourses of key religious ﬁgures have functioned as tools for mobilising the population and for broadcasting particular sets of ideas .
 The main religious structures of Ukraine have become involved in the ideological war waged by the Russian Federation and Ukraine on both local and international levels .
Both sides will have to accept the scope of compromise that the sides will eventually have to agree to accept .
 Ukrainian churches have deeply involved themselves in this debate . They have adjusted their modes of representation to their previous discursive strategies, cultural ideologies and basic institutional interests .
 There have been numerous reports on this subject in various Ukrainian media as well on the web sites and social media pages of religious organisations themselves .
 The UOC-MP has come to be seen by many Ukrainian political and religious activists as the main vehicle of Russian ideological inﬂuence, a subsidiary of the Russian secret service and a ﬁfth column .
 The clergy of this church has been regularly accused in the media of spreading pro-Russian propaganda, lack of loyalty to the Ukrainian state and collaboration with the separatist forces .
 The UOC-MP discursively constructed its oﬃcial standpoint regarding the political situation after the Euromaidan protests in the context of the ideological struggle between Russia and Ukraine .
 The UOC-MP's relationship with the state and the signiﬁcant changes in its religious policies have contributed to the exacerbation of the relations. In addition, it also aims to show how the implicit ambiguities and ideological dilemmas in this standpoint have
 The main source material for this paper comes from media interviews, addresses, documents and blog entries published by the oﬃcial speakers of the UOC-MP and the U OC-KP in the period between February 2014 and October 2018 .
 The source base includes documents of the Ukrainian Parliament as well as public speeches and interviews of the President of Ukraine .
 Most of the items fall under the same category of materials which have circulated in the public sphere of Ukraine .
 The church will not be included in this analysis due to the low level of its involvement in the public discourse, surrounding the Russian-Ukrainian crisis . However, this church is not included in the analysis because of its role in public discourse .
 The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has been rather active in voicing its position regarding the events in Ukraine after February 2014 . The church has attracted signiﬁcant media attention.
 The UOC-MP is registered with the government as the ‘Ukrainian Orthodox Church’ The ROC is only linked to the ROC only by the recognition of the Patriarch of Moscow as its formal head .
 The hierarchy of the UOC-MP has continued to be fully subordinated to the ROC . The ROC only followed instructions issued in Moscow .
 In the contemporary situation religious ﬁgures often resort to diﬀerent media tools to express their views publically under di��aeerent circumstances .
 Church discourses may turn into multilayered and fragmented phenomena . This includes social media posts, blogs and comments made during TV shows .
 The Russian-Ukrainian crisis has become a political crisis . Church spokespersons have been trying to reconstruct their positions on the crisis .
 The central dimensions of depth of depth hermeneutics are discursive analysis and interpretation . The central dimension of depth is discursiveAnalysis and interpretation.
Linguistic constructions (narratives, argumentative structures and syntactic structures) play an important role in the production and operation of various forms of ideology in discourses .
 Thompson uses Titus Hjelm as a methodological core for a critical understanding of the role of religion in the public sphere .
 Hjelm argues that critical discourse analysis orients the researcher towards what is ‘unsaid’ or ‘omitted’ in discourses with the purpose of producing a more coherent and logical image of social reality .
 This aspect mostly refers to oversimpliﬁcation of a situation by excluding inconvenient/contradicting facts or ideas which threaten to undermine or cast doubt on the plausibility of an ideological structure as a whole .
 Images of reality12 serve for the mobilisation of individuals for certain causes, giving them the sense of absolute rightness and making them more persistent and decisive in their actions .
 Such inherently ideological representations are disseminated by being repeatedly reproduced in the public discourse in order to shape the perception of social and political issues in a particular way .
 In less pronounced forms, this strategy of omission and oversimpliﬁcation refers to the situation where discourse is used to foreground one issue at the expense of others .
 Manchin and Mayr also include in this category . Some broad and multidimensional 7 John Thompson, Studies in the Theory of Ideology .
 Vivien Burr deﬁnes discourse is described as ‘a set of meanings, metaphors, representations, images, stories, statements and so on that in some way together produce a particular version of events.
Social analysis aims to contextualise ideologies and reveal their connections to the socio-political reality and the status of diﬀerent social agents . These elements of discourse analysis will be supplemented by another dimension of hermeneutics, namely social analysis .
 The church has no inﬂuence or role whatsoever in the process of deﬁning or negotiating the essence of the Ukrainian crisis .
 Metropolitan Antonii and other hierarchs have insisted on the right – or even the obligation – of the church to refrain from political statements .
 In the socio-political climate of the post-Euromaidan period it has become virtually impossible for the UOC-MP to make any public statements devoid of any inherent political messages or that are proof against political interpretation .
 The majority of the church's documents regarding the crisis have been phrased in a normative and general way without attributing responsibility for its emergence to people or institutions .
 UOCMP’s oﬃcial speakers which occasionally appear in the public sphere reﬂect the inherent duality in this church's discursive agenda .
 The contradictory messages emanating from the UOC-MP have signiﬁcantly contributed to exacerbating political tension around this structure . The contradictory message has contributed to exacerbate political tension, says the MP .
 The oﬃcial UOC-MP declared its full and unequivocal support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine . On the one hand, from the earliest phase of the Russian-Ukrainian conﬂict in February 2014, the o�
 The Primate of the UOC-MP Metropolitan Onufrii condemned the idea of secessionism . He called upon their rank-and-ﬁle clergy to prevent any secessionist sentiments among lay believers .
 UOCMP's public declarations in favour of Ukrainian sovereignty have cast doubt on its patriotic orientation . On the other hand, there have been other politically loaded aspects.
 The conﬂict as ﬁrst and foremost an internal issue of Ukraine. Key among them has been the representation of the current military and political situation as a 'civil war' or an ‘internecine struggle’
 Speaking speciﬁcally of the war raging in the East, I would like to point to its essence .
 In some families one brother is ﬁghting on one side and the other brother is  on the other side . In some family members one brother has a brother on the same side .
 Many of my friends who live in Kyiv but are originally from Donetsk say that their friends have taken the other side . Many of their friends live in the Donetsk region but say that they are from Donetsk .
 Those who live here are on our side and those who decided to stay there joined the other side . Those who stay there are on their side and some who live in the UK are on the side .
 Metropolitan Onufrii declared the unacceptability of the clergy and lay believers’ participating in what he called ‘armed acts of civil disobedience’ in East Ukraine .
Metropolitan Antonii and priest Mykolai Danylevych articulated to essentially the same view .
 Metropolitan Onufrii undergirded his idea of a civil conﬂict in Ukraine was the presupposition that Ukrainian citizens were ﬁghting on both sides of the frontline .
 But they have got their own state of aﬀairs, di�²erent heroes and di��aeerent values . But they also have their ownState of a ﬀerent values, they say .
 Metropolitan Antonii. A similar standpoint, which shores up claims about civil war in Ukraine by tracing its origins to cultural differences among the population, is also central in public discourse .
 49 remarked that he was following the ideas laid down in Samuel Huntington's famous book The Clash of Civilisations and the Remaking of World Order .
 It can be argued that these and other basic presuppositions about the innate multiculturalism of Ukraine originated in the discourse of the UOC-MP long before the Euromaidan have several important discursive functions .
 UOC-MP have advanced an overarching framework which positions separatist forces in eastern Ukraine as a genuine social movement .
 All the forces currently present in the country have the right to continue their existence in Ukraine in the future. We must acknowledge that all the forces current present in Ukraine have a right to remain .
 The Kyiv Patriarchate, Greek Catholics or Protestants cannot be thrown out of Ukraine . That is our Church, the Kyiv patriarchate, the Church, and the Church of the Ukraine. That is the Church.
 All of us, as diﬀerent as we are in pro-Western and pro-Eastern orientations, have to sit at one table and state that we all intend to live together in Ukraine .
 The image of the Ukrainian crisis as an 'internal conﬂict' is not strongly propagated in the UOC-MP's public discourse .
 This representation is not a political claim per se, but a discursive strategy intended to preclude the sides from total rupture which could make potential reconciliation in the future nearly impossible .
 UOC-MP's hierarchs bring up the idea of civil war and omit acknowledging Russia’s role as an actor in the current crisis, says Hjelm .
 The evaluation of the war as an internal armed conﬂict fully corresponds to the one promoted by Patriarch Kirill, the Primate of the ROC . Russian state authorities deny any involvement in the Ukrainian events .
 The UOC-MP clash strongly with the ofﬁcial ideological line of the Ukrainian political regime . The opposition has been fully focused on representing the war 30 ‘Ukrains’ke Pravoslav’ia na rubezhi epokh.
 Vyklyky suchasnosti, such as the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between Two Eras, is the name of the Orthodoxy in Ukraine .
 The UOC-MP has been accused of being a vehicle of Russian propaganda in Ukraine . The church is controlled from Moscow, according to the UOC MP .
 The UOC-MP has consistently claimed that it cannot be considered an actor or a ‘side’ in this political confrontation . However, despite its clear ideological overlap with the ROC, the MP has consistently said it can't be considered as an actor .
 speakers of the church have also denied any relationship to the so-called ‘Russian world’ ideology which has been used by the separatists in East Ukraine .
 The Russian church has never spoken about the idea of the Russian world .
 You shall not ﬁnd any text, any oﬃcial statement in support of this idea . Neither from the now deceased Metropolitan Volodymyr, nor from the current Metropolitan Onufrii.
 We consider this idea to be political, geo-political, or geo-spiritual, or whatever it is, with some elements of Christianity .
 Metropolitan Onufrii himself has expressed his refusal to be associated with the Russian world doctrine .
 The UOC-MP's strategy is informed by this church's ideological presuppositions and by practical considerations which reﬂect its institutional interests .
 Russians and Ukrainians have shared ethnic roots and religious heritage of the past several centuries . This view also informs the doctrine about a particular closeness of Russian and Ukrainians that results from their sharedethnic roots .
 51 openly to denounce the separatist movements because this would also mean at least partially undermining its own cultural ideology .
 UOC-MP aims to maintain the eﬀect of its political neutrality and inclusivity .
 Ukraine per se, Crimea as a territory under the direct Russian control, and the regions of East Ukraine controlled by the separatist forces . Crimea is under the control of the Crimea region .
 The UOC-MP in Kyiv has been reduced to balancing between competing political views and ideologically driven discourses . In this situation, in order to escape looming institutional fragmentation, the oﬃcial representatives of the U OC-MP have been reduced.
 The UOC-MP’s claim to political neutrality has been explicitly acknowledged by Metropolitan Antonii on a number of occasions as strategic necessities and forced measures . The MP's claim topolitical neutrality and its avoidance of certain kinds of public statements have been acknowledged by the
38 local Orthodox bishops and clergy have continued to maintain their formal aﬃliation with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church . The Orthodox Church is closely interacting with the Russian authorities in Crimea .
 UOC-MP in Kyiv has been progressively adjusting its discourse to prove its full loyalty to the Ukrainian state and support for its sovereignty and territorial integrity .
 The church increased its social media activity, showcasing its involvement in chaplaincy for the Ukrainian army . The clergy of the UOC-MP provided funeral services for the fallen Ukrainian soldiers .
 The Primate of this structure, Patriarch Filaret, has been in the forefront of the public discourse as one of the most vocal symbolic leaders of the discursive struggle .
 Patriarch Filaret's discourse in this period has revolved around exposing and condemning the aggression of Russia against Ukraine .
 Patriarch Filaret often resorted to comparisons of President Putin and his policies to Adolf Hitler and the policies of Nazi Germany .
 He used the term ‘Anschluss’ in 1938, when referring to the annexation of Crimea . He used it to refer to Austria's annexation of the Crimea .
 The hierarch also drew parallels between the ‘Great Patriotic War’ of the Soviet Union and the current situation in Ukraine . The hierarch made a case for the necessity of mobilisation of the population against the Russian Federation as an aggressor state .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently avoided public condemnation of Russia as an aggressor state . Putin has been accused of being an aggressive state of Russia .
 The leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate do not call the interference of Russia in Crimea an act of aggression . They repeat the words of Moscow that it is a civil war, and Russia has nothing to do with it .
 53 acknowledge the participation of Russia in this war because they are politically dependent on the Moscow Patriarchate .
 There is no civil war in East Ukraine – there is an aggressor, Russia, there. There is not a civil war, there is no war in the Ukraine, there's no aggressor .
 If it were not for the external interference, we would have done away with those secessionists . However, if it weren't for the External interference, they would have been removed .
 The whole strength of the secessionists comes from Russia’s help with its military forces and arms . Russia's help with the military force and arms comes from its own military forces .
 The position of the UOC-KP was fully aligned with the ofﬁcial ideological line of the Ukrainian government .
 This view of the ongoing military conﬂict was also formulated by Patriarch Filaret in his other statements regarding the foundational issues behind its origins .
 Ukrainian land is Ukrainian land, but Russian land is Russian land . Russian land has no right to cut Ukrainian land and annex it to Russia . Ukrainian land should not be cut and annexed to Russia.
 peace and wellbeing will come to Donbas when its citizens realise that they belong to the Ukrainian people .
 If they do not want to belong to the Ukrainian people – this is their right but then they have to leave this land . If they don't want to belongs to the Ukrainians, this is the right. If they are not in Ukraine, they must leave the land .
 This military conﬂict cannot be conceived of as civil war but only as another form of external invasion . From this perspective, this military Con�ctict can't be thought of as a civil war .
 Patriarch Filaret is careful to make a key distinction between the sides of the struggle . He says those who simply hold Ukrainian citizenship are 'Ukrainians' as an ethnic group .
 The Ukrainian state and the UOC-MP have been trying to accommodate itself in an adverse political climate . The existence of such a social organisation has been a liability for the current Ukrainian political regime .
53 the UOC-MP, as a fully legal organisation, has become the last link that continues to tie Ukraine to Russia . Many pro-Russian socio-political actors have had to cease their activity completely or go into underground .
As soon as the military action in East Ukraine started to subside, the front line stabilised in 2015 . In this context, various political forces in the Ukrainian Parliament and in the Presidential administration started looking for ways to neutralise the potential impact of the UOC-MP as a social
 President Poroshenko resumed the attempts of his predecessors to overcome the existing division in Ukrainian Orthodoxy .
 The public discourse of the main political actors regarding this issue has been shored up by both open and veiled references to ongoing Russian aggression and to the use of the religious factor by Russia to justify its interference through creating a new line of political division .
 The contemporary Moscow Patriarchate is too closely linked to the political regime dominating in Russia to be perceived as a Church rather than a ministry of ideology of the Russian Federation .
 The Ecumenical Patriarchate is perceived by many citizens of our country as a moral accomplice of Russian aggression and hybrid war against Ukraine .
Ukrainian Orthodoxy has been upgraded in status for Ukrainian Orthodoxy . Ukraine's President, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister held numerous ofﬁcial meetings with the Ecumenical Patriarch .
 The UOC-KP has remained a self-proclaimed entity, as a legitimate Orthodox structure, since 1992 . In effect, this would mean the recognition of the close ideological ally of the Ukrainian state .
 The emergence of a new fully canonical Orthodox structure in Ukraine would cause an inevitable exodus of believers and whole communities from the UOC-MP .
 President Poroshenko tried to put political pressure on hierarchs of the UOC-MP by sending them oﬃcial letters with insistent calls to begin the process of uniting with the Kyiv Patriarchate voluntarily .
 In June 2016 the UOC-MP launched an unprecedented all-Ukrainian pilgrimage . ‘The Procession of the Cross for Peace, Love and Prayer’ meant to unite symbolically Left-Bank and RightBank Ukraine .
 This pilgrimage demonstrated the signiﬁcant mobilisational potential of the UOC-MP . This pilgrimage also provoked a large controversy and a wave of moral panic .
 The event was designated as a purely political action intended to destabilise the situation in the country . Among other things, the event was intended to create conditions for direct Russian invasion .
 It caused a certain level of anxiety among the highest public oﬃcials of Ukraine . It also caused an anxiety level among the most high-level of anxiety in Ukraine .
 Speaker of the Parliament Andrii Parubii described the event as an act organised by the Kremlin's secret services .
 I think it will be easy to ﬁnd an equivalent expression for this Ukrainian phrase in the Church Slavonic language .
 The UOC-MP is not mentioned here by name, but it is clear that these ‘palliative’ forms are most characteristic of its discourse . In the same way, the reference to Church Slavonic also serves as a thinly veiled warning .
 The process of obtaining autocephaly through political channels seemed to have hit a dead end in 2016 . In April 2018 President Poroshenko held another meeting with the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul .
 57 Parliament named UOC-MP as an actor in a ‘hybrid war against Ukraine’ His role was to propagate the legitimacy of Crimea and support Russia’s military interference in East Ukraine .
 The intention to grant autocephalous status to Ukrainian Orthodoxy was oﬃcially reconﬁrmed by the Constantinople Patriarchate on October 11, 2018 .
 The decision no longer to consider legally binding the Synodal Letter which passed control over the Kyiv Metropoly to the Moscow Patriarchate in 1686 . The annulment of the anathema imposed by the ROC on the leader of the UOC-KP Patriarch
 Other political forces in the Ukrainian Parliament attempted to undermine the positions of the UOC-MP by modifying its legal status. Simultaneously with the eﬀorts of President Poroshenko in the area of Orthodox autocephaly .
Since February 2016, a group of people’s deputies has introduced a number of draft laws . Despite their generalised phrasing were tailor-made to reduce the inﬂuence of this church in the current socio-political circumstances .
 The draft law was intended to simplify the legal procedure for religious communities wishing to change their oﬃcial a�ăliation .
 The main role in making this decision was taken from the clergy and granted to the community of parishioners themselves .
 The bill was to stimulate debates on church aﬃliation within Orthodox congregations of the UOC-MP . It was intended to encourage those who were on the fence or had simply been discouraged from switching .
 It was also meant to facilitate a legally sound transfer of communities from the UOC-MP to the U OC-KP in those cases where the process was impeded merely by the loyalties of the clergy .
Violent clashes between believers and legal battles in courts attracted attention even on the international level, raising concerns about the state of religious freedom in Ukraine .
 UOC-MP argues for systematic religious persecution against this organisation by Ukrainian authorities .
 religious entities would have to sign a special treaty with the Ukrainian state to declare its political loyalty . Such a religious entity would need to sign the treaty to declare their loyalty .
 It would also need to get endorsements from the state authorities for appointment of all signiﬁcant church oﬃcials .
 The state would have the right to revoke their registration. In cases where such religious organisations were found guilty of collaboration with the 'enemy'
 New regulations targeted the UOC-MP, which remains part of the Russian Orthodox Church . It recognises the Patriarch of Moscow as its Primate .
Draft law would make UOC-MP an actor in the current framework of the Russian-Ukrainian conﬂict and contribute to its further discrediting in the eyes of the Ukrainian population .
 The third draft law is designed according to the same basic principles as № 4511 . It concerns religious organisations whose oﬃcial centre is located on the territory of the aggressor state .
 UOC-MP is a Russian 'Trojan horse' in Ukraine, a fact obscured from the common believer by the word ‘Ukrainian’ in its name . This, in the view of certain politicians and religious ﬁgures, would more adequately re�
 The draft laws were fervently supported by the patriotically oriented political and religious forces willing to alienate this church in the public consciousness .
 The bills raised questions about the propriety of the state’s intrusion into church aﬀairs, violation of religious freedoms and creation of potentially disastrous consequences for religious peace in Ukraine .
 The Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine has been forced to make changes to its law . The Church has been criticised by the Ukrainian government for the changes .
 The UOC-MP gathered several thousand of its believers near the building of the Parliament . On May 18, 2017, the bills 4128 and 4511 were to be voted on .
 Ruling political factions in the Parliament decided to take the two documents oﬀ the table .
 President Poroshenko in his annual speech before the Parliament in September 2017 speciﬁcally asserted he would not sign such laws even if they were passed by the majority .
 Ukrainian Orthodoxy had been granted autocephalous status . In July 2018, the Speaker Andrii Parubii asserted that these draft laws were postponed only temporarily and would be put back on Parliament's agenda .
Both the quest for autocephaly and the new laws are part of a systematic religious policy pursued by the President and a signiﬁcant group of Ukrainian political leadership . This suggests that both the quest and the laws are parts of a system of
 The UOC-MP and the state with regard to the current crisis manifested itself in the strained relations of this church with the Department of Religions and Ethnicities in the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine .
 The church has accused the Department of waging an open defamation campaign against the UOC-MP in order to discredit it in Ukraine .
 The head of the legal division of the UOC-MP, priest Oleksandr Bahov, also claimed that since 2014 the Department’s oﬃcials had deliberately impeded the registration of statutory documents of U OC-MP congregations .
 In February 2017 the UOC-MP ﬁled a law suit against the Ministry of Culture . In some mainstream media was presented as a ‘law suit against Ukraine’ In its turn, the Department defended its policies by arguing that the statutes were written from Russian templates .
 Department of Religions and Ethnicities also closely followed the activities of the UOC-MP in Crimea and the rebel-controlled territories of Donbas .
 Ministry of Culture accused the UOC-MP of open collaboration with Russian authorities and separatist government .
 The Department called upon law-enforcement agencies to investigate anti-Ukrainian activities of the clergy of this church in general . Also called upon the UOC-MP publically to condemn the aggression of Russian Federation .
 Metropolitan Mitrofan, who occupies the post of the head of the UOC-MP, stringently denied the accusations as based on a misinterpretation of facts .
 This dispute between the hierarch and a government body did not result in any public reaction from the law-enforcement agencies of Ukraine .
Politics, RELIGION & IDEOLOGY 61 for social peace and political stability .
 The positions of this church appeared to be relatively stable. Even given the ongoing military conﬂict with the Russian Federation, the positions of the church appear to be stable .
 Social surveys show a drastic decrease in popular support for the UOC-MP between 2014 and 201786 . The MP was still capable of mobilising large numbers of believers for its defence .
 The UOC-MP is ‘the church of the aggressor state that conducts harmful activities in Ukraine’ was supported only by 19.2% of those surveyed .
 The Kyiv Patriarchate wants to get oﬃcial recognition in the Orthodox world . The state’s interference in religious aﬀairs remains an unpopular measure with the population .
In the postEuromaidan period this issue has appeared in the discourses of major Ukrainian religious organisations as well .
 The UOC-MP and the U OC-KP have been oﬀering opposite approaches to representing this issue in the public space . It has also created another fault line between the two major Orthodox structures .
 The former opposition church, the UOC-KP, is a close ally of the current state regime . It is now a major political adversary in a strong confrontation with the state and political society of Ukraine .
 The strategy has been extensively used by the church’s oﬃcial speakers to avoid making explicit statements on certain issues .
 At the same time, it has created an inherent ambiguity in the public stance of the UOC-MP regarding the war and its causes .
 The church has omitted the public acknowledgment of Russia as an actor in the conﬂict and b . It has represented the con-ict as primarily an internal problem of Ukraine which emerged as the result of unresolved cultural tensions inside the country .
 UOC-MP’s approach is based on the principle of political inclusivity (the church accepts Ukrainians of all political convictions) In eﬀect legitimises the ideological agenda of the secessionist movement .
 The UOC-MP has put itself in strong opposition to the Ukrainian political regime . It has been trying to consolidate the country internally by imposing a hegemonic representation of the military .
 UOC-MP's discursive standpoint fully accords with that of the Russian political regime, which has denied any interested involvement in the Ukrainian situation and represented it as a civil war . The Ukrainian state’s ideological line has been aggravated for the U OC-MP by the fact
 The UOC-MP has become more vulnerable to the attacks of its religious and political opponents .
 UOC-MP's speakers defend their ambiguous position by pointing to the necessity of saving the church’s institutional unity, which is currently threatened .
 The UOC-MP continued to feel institutionally strong enough to keep its professedly neutral standpoint . Despite the mounting political pressure from the state, nationalist political forces, and the majority of mainstream media after 2014, the U OC-MP continues to feel strong enough .
 Ukrainian Orthodoxy in Crimea and Donbas have declared their aﬃliation with Ukraine Orthodoxy . This means that the costs of continuing opposition in the Ukrainian political ﬁeld were lower for the UOC-MP than the U OC-MP .
 Ukrainian government's attempts to obtain oﬃcial recognition and autocephaly for the Kyiv Patriarchate would not be fruitful . ROC would still be a viable option for maintaining the UOC-MP's religious monopoly as the only ‘canonical’ Orthodox church
