 The article explores the Russia–Ukraine crisis of 2014 in the context of post-communist nationalism and the disintegration of the post-Soviet space .
 The focus is on the politicisation of the ethno-linguistic divide and historical narratives . Russia's determination to control Ukraine's political future and Ukraine's resolve to free itself from Russian inﬂuence .
 The Ukrainian crisis is not an ethnic conﬂict per se, it is argued that nationalism was a signiﬁcant contributory factor in fuelling the crisis . It remains a relevant obstacle to its resolution .
 The RUSSIA– UKRAINE CRISIS in the SPRING of 2014 STANDS for a series of interconnected and violent events .
 The ﬁrst occurred between government forces under the pro-Russian then president, Viktor Yanukovych, and pro-reform demonstrators . Yanukovych reneged on under Russian pressure .
 The second event, the annexation of Crimea, was not particularly marked by violence but by a blatant disregard for international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty .
 The subsequent pro-Russia mobilisation in eastern Ukraine, with military support from Russia, culminated in the armed conﬂict in Donbas, unresolved to this day .
 If the promise of a united, democratic and peaceful Europe was shattered by the wars on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the Ukrainian crisis was evidence of a whole new disillusionment .
 Russia exposed the fragility of the post-Cold War order in Europe . Russia not only exploited the weaknesses of the Ukrainian state and extended its own territory .
 This crisis is the culmination of a number of internal and wider geopolitical factors connected to both Russia and Ukraine . The crisis is a result of a series of internal issues connected to Russia and the Ukraine .
 Wilson sees Russia’s aggression towards and interference in Ukraine as the preponderant cause of the crisis . Wilson on the other hand, while acknowledging Ukraine's many internal problems, sees Russia's aggression towards Ukraine .
 The Russia–Ukraine crisis does indeed appear to have different origins than other postcommunist conﬂicts, such as the Yugoslav wars . As it presents a considerable challenge to the existing order in Europe and calls into question the ability of the international community to shape events
 Ukraine Crisis may obscure the analysis of some of the more prosaic identity-related dynamics aggravated by the conﬂict .
 Such dynamics could have been observed in earlier conﬂicts in post-Soviet space, the Balkans and the rest of post-communist Europe .
 The dismantling of the Soviet institutional legacy of ethnofederalism as part of state-building by Ukraine should also be taken into consideration . The role of ethnic kin abroad (Melvin 1995; Saideman & Ayres 2008; Shevel 2011; Harris 2012); Harris 2012.
 The fast growing literature on this crisis does not analyse the huge impact of post-communism on identity . The premise is that the fast-growing literature on the crisis doesn't analyse the impact of statehood .
 The Russia-Ukraine conﬂict is a Russian-Ukrainian writer and author . His research question centres on the role and nature of nationalism and ethnicity in the Russia–Ukraine.
 The core contribution of this article is in debating the role of conﬂicting Russian and Ukrainian nationalisms . Each countries’ respective use of the ethno-linguistic divide and manipulation of historical memory .
 I apply theories of nationalism and ethnicity within the broader context of the post-communist disintegration of multinational federations generally . In relation to nationand state-building processes in Russia and Ukraine.
In the world divided into nationstates, ethnic and national identities serve as a measure of political legitimacy . In the world, national identities are important categories for political analysis .
 The particularity of post-communism is the simultaneity and speed of social, political and economic transformation at the same time as the new nation-states were forming .
 The formation and establishment of a nation-state is a mammoth bureaucratic and ideational undertaking . It increases the contestation of identities and the general level of national mobilisation .
Only in some post-communist states, only in some cases, namely the Balkans, did it lead to armed conﬂict .
 Russia–Ukraine conﬂict. I do not argue that there is a direct causal link between nationalism and ethnicity . I seek to show that political disagreements about the future of the state, a change of regional dynamics related to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, do release the
 Ethnicity is affected by political developments and vice versa . The focus is on the politicisation of ethnicity, which has become interchangeable with ethnolinguistic divide .
 Ukraine is seeking to extricate itself from the Russian sphere of inﬂuence . Russia is trying to subvert that process by exploiting the loyalties and identities of the population in eastern Ukraine .
 The next section clariﬁes the terms of reference and establishes the link between nationalism/ethnicity and regime type within the Soviet Union and within postcommunist transformation processes .
 This debate about the ethnicisation of postcommunist transition processes is followed by discussion of what appears to be the continuing disintegration of the post-Soviet space .
 The argument then moves to the political and regional fragility of the new Ukrainian state . It culminates in the popular uprising against the Yanukovych government and the role of Russia .
Russian-Ukrainian linguistic divide is a proxy for ethnicity in the conﬂict between Ukrainians and ‘Russian speakers’
 The Ukrainian crisis is not an ethnic conﬂict as such, the author says . The number of factors driving the crisis requires the interpretation of this crisis from a perspective of nationalism and ethnicity .
 This process engendered further re-evaluations of historical narratives, leading to more questioning of people’s loyalties, more anxiety by ethnic groups .
 Two extreme cases where the disintegration led to wars are the territories of the former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union . The two extreme cases are the former Yugoslav and Soviet territories .
 paramilitary units with conﬂicting loyalties to different actors. Further down the line, this resulted in the mobilisation of paramilitary units . The presentation of the current crisis in the light of past con ﬂicts by governments .
 The similarities between these two post-communist conﬂicts do not extend to wider geopolitical impact of Russia in its near abroad and globally .
 After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian nation became divided by numerous borders with a huge Russian-speaking diaspora in Ukraine .
 The Russia–Ukraine crisis contains many aspects relating to the changes in position of ethnic groups within the newly reformed post-Soviet space . The analysis is only within the scope of this article .
 The annexation of Crimea and the intervention in the overwhelmingly Russian-speaking Donbas region in eastern Ukraine have demonstrated . I will return to Russia’s attempts to recover its diminished post-Soviet status in more detail below .
Drawing on theories of nationalism, the following paragraphs set out the analytical framework through which the relevance of ethnicity in the Russia–Ukraine crisis is argued .
 It is the self-ascription and ascription by others that contributes to the persistence of ethnicity and implies collective action . The self-ascription and ascriptions by others contribute to persistence of ethnic groups .
 In the present context there are three important characteristics pertaining to ethnicity . In the past, there have been three key characteristics relating to ethnicity.
 Ethnicity transcends the physical boundaries of states and is not necessarily deﬁned by state citizenship . First, as a cultural trait, ethnicity transcends physical borders of states .
 The second point is particularly relevant to the context of postSoviet space . The second is particularlyrelevant to thecontext of post Soviet space .
 ‘language is an important vehicle of ethnicity’ and expands the concept of ethnicity ‘beyond traits which are descent-based’ or historically determined .
 The fundamental principle of federalism in the Soviet Union was ‘national–territorial autonomy’ That is, the linkage of ethnicity, territory and political administration .
 In the USSR, more than 50 putatively autonomous national ‘homelands’ were established in a four-tiered ethno-federal hierarchy . Each deﬁned as the territory of and for a particular ethno national group .
 The Soviet institutional legacy for managing ethnicity within a controlled authoritarian system created inherent tensions among ethnic groups that were bound to resurface following the demise of the system .
 The reassembling of disintegrating states unavoidably focused on the communist legacy of the national question . In too many cases left unresolved antagonisms going back to World War II, as is the case in Russia–Ukraine relationship .
Nationalism is crucial to the politics of nation-states that present themselves as a state for and of one nation . Nationalism is a 'political principle that holds that cultural and political units should be congruent'
 When new political identities are forming, ‘the people’ need to be demarcated . It is their ethnic afﬁliation that tends to ﬁll the legitimacy gap left by previous political ties .
 Its policies are rooted in a deliberate effort to construct an overarching collective identity based on a putative common national sentiment .
 The imbalance between those two parallel processes when nation-building takes precedence over state-building suggests a nationalising state . This is roughly what tended to happen in post-communist states, including Ukraine and, importantly, in Russia .
 Russia and Ukraine subscribe to some of these key elements, if not necessarily to all of them . The list of key elements leaves the question of hierarchy open .
In Ukraine, where ethno-national and linguistic boundaries are blurred, nationalisation meant reshaping and enlarging the core nation within the state .
When space, politics and people’s identities are being reconﬁgured, ethnicity assumes a political role. So far, I have presented theoretical arguments for why, when space and politics are being re-imagined, people's identities are becoming more political .
 The political process would beneﬁt from the absence of politicised ethnicity and history . But the contrary appears to be the case, says David Cameron .
 Russia-Ukraine conﬂict is in order, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: An important qualiﬁcation is in Order .
 In such regimes, formal democratic institutions are used to obtain and maintain political authority by the abuse of state resources and by preventing the opposition from equal electoral competition .
 The Freedom House report gives Ukraine a democratic score of 4.64/7 . Russia's score is 6.61/7, signifying a ‘consolidated authoritarian regime’ The next sections focus on the construction of the Russian and Ukrainian nations .
After the initial break-up of the Soviet Union and the establishment of 15 successor states on its former territory, there were many regional and ethnic conﬂicts among and within the successor states .
 The following examples draw attention to a number of dynamics relevant to secessionism and interethnic conﬂicts in the post-Soviet space .
 South Ossetian separatists seeking reuniﬁcation with Northern Ossetia in Russia . The pursuit of guarantees by the Abkhaz minority against the Georgian majority led to the military conﬂict in 1992 .
 Russian-speaking population in post-independence Moldova felt marginalised by the newly privileged Romanian language and the new Romanian-speaking economic elite . separatists also supported by Russia .
 In this case irredentist politics garnered much support from Armenia proper but also from the Armenian diaspora . In the case, irredENTist politics gained much support.
 Given the ‘frozen’ status of these all too brieﬂicts, they continue to fester and provide ground for new con�cticts to re-emerge .
 In this ‘reframed’ scenario, the newly reconﬁgured states and their elites promote the core self-determining national group .
 The promotion of the language, culture, demographic position and political hegemony of the state-forming ethno-cultural group alienates minorities . In turn, their resistance and growing nationalism galvanises their ‘external’ homeland to protect their co-ethnics in the new states .
There are three different mutually interacting nationalisms around the borders of nearly all new states . There are three separate nationalisms.
 Russia is seeking the reversal of its diminished status by pursuing regional dominance . Russia is a kin-state of considerable importance, says Vladimir Putin .
 Putin made the case for his domestic audience that the Russian nation was greater than its borders . He said Ukraine received huge territories from Russia in the east and the south .
 He was also warning the international community about Russia’s future foreign policy trajectory .
 Russia annexed Crimea on the pretext of alleged discrimination against Russian speakers there should not have been a surprise after Russia’s previous interventions in Georgia and Chechnya .
 On 17 March 2014, the Republic of Crimea proclaimed its independence and sovereignty on the basis of the referendum . The referendum was held in Crimea .
 Putin listed the right to selfdetermination of Crimean people, the protection of Russians living there and regional stability . Putin listed Russia's part in the annexation of Crimea .
 Crimea’s economy was highly Sovietised, dominated by the military–industrial complex and Soviet tourism . It remained one of the most conservatively ‘Soviet’ regions in the newly independent Ukraine .
 Russian nationalist and separatist movement in 1994 led to territorial autonomy . This resulted in demands for territorial autonomy, which culminated in the 1994 separatist movement .
 The ousting of the pro-Russian Yanukovych and his replacement by a pro-European administration sparked off demonstrations in Crimea and precipitated the Russian intervention .
 Crimean referendum claimed 97% support among Crimean voters for joining Russia . Ukrainian government and media characterised Crimean separatism as having minority support .
 In 1989, the Donbas miners, ‘the least nationally conscious group’ staged the ‘ﬁr�rst major strike in Soviet history’ and continued to strike until the mid-1990s .
 Political mobilisation for regional autonomy was linked to the combination of socio-economic, ideological, ideological and identity factors . Only some of which were mutually reinforcing, according to the study .
 The anger and dissatisfaction in Donbas sparked off the separatist movement . It was exacerbated and manipulated by rivalries among, often ethnically based, local business clans .
 The fall of the Yanukovych government was a serious threat to local oligarchs who relied on Russian business . Donbas industry had relied on the Ukrainian gas and subsidies .
 Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine was approved by the Russian Duma in March 2014 . Russia's military involvement was approved in April 2014 .
 In both Crimea and Donbas, the long-standing, historically evolved ‘social distance’ from Kyiv did not diminish in the context of the new post-Soviet Ukraine .
 A movement for regional autonomy is not the same as separatism, let alone an escalation into an armed conﬂict .
 War in Donbas was unlikely to happen without Russian military support . In each case, the existing tensions and grievances were manipulated by both Ukrainian and Russian elites .
 The ﬁrst is the construction of the postSoviet Russian nation in eth no-linguistic and ethno-cultural terms . The term is used in all post-communist states and with particular violence on the territory of the former Yugoslavia .
 Shevel has described the dilemmas of post-Soviet Russian nation-building elites in constructing a new Russian identity . Shevel says the country needed to reﬂect its new ‘successor state’ status and the diversity of ethnohistories and cultures within
 It is viewed with suspicion by Russian nationalists, who see it as discriminatory against ethnic Russians, as well as by non-Russian groups, who fear Russiﬁcation .
 The increasingly irredentist terminology of the Kremlin augments the cultural and linguistic underpinnings of the Russian nation by identifying it with the former Soviet Union .
 The annexation of Crimea, the distribution of Russian passports in frozen conﬂict zones and the military support for eastern Ukrainian compatriots are all typical actions for a nationalising kin-state .
 The demarcation of the Russian nation is an elastic concept . The borders of this geographically disengaged ‘wherever nation’ stretches to wherever it can serve as a remedy for territorial loss or aid the recovery of regional dominance .
 Laruelle argues that Russian nationalism rests on the concept of Novorossiya . The concept dates back to the eighteenth century and envisages a redesigned Black Sea region .
 The term re-emerged in 1994 among Transnistrian separatists as a way of substantiating their rights to join the Russian Federation . The term was used to substantiate their right to join Russia .
 The notion of Novorossiya has been promoted by the separatists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics .
 The corruption of the Ukrainian ruling elite and the military involvement and resources provided by Russia to divert Ukraine from its intended political path towards the West and the EU . The crisis can be interpreted from a nationalist perspective debatable.
 nationalism and ethnicity, while not decisive explanatory factors, play a signiﬁcant contributory role, if at times indirectly .
 Identity and historical factors have been instrumentalised and mobilised by Russia for the purpose of polarising Ukrainian society . Russia’s interests override international law and Ukrainian independence .
 The mobilisation of ethnicity and language by Ukrainian elites draws on existing divisions and earlier struggles . It creates new narratives that project past events and fears onto present concerns .
 The Ukrainian crisis is a failure to grasp its full complexity, says the author . underestimating the role of identity and history in an analysis of the Ukrainian crisis does not represent a failure.
 It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into the origins and details of the Russia– Ukraine conﬂict. It is not the first time this article has been written about the Russia-Ukraine con �ctict .
Independent, postcommunist Ukraine is a state that had never before been united within one independent state . Ukraine is one of several regions that never before was united within a single state .
 The new Ukraine faced potential territorial challenges from its regions, mostly from the Sovietised Crimea, as well as Transcarpathia and Donbas .

 Maidan in 2013–2014 was a response to the failure of the political establishment and persistent corruption . Maidan was in response to failure of political establishment, persistent corruption and persistent Corruption .
 The Yanukovych government was supposed to guarantee that Kyiv was within Russia’s ‘zone of privileged interests’
 The popular uprising threatened the oligarchic pro-Russian elite beyond Ukraine . Russia’s annexation of Crimea and backing of separatists in the east may have had less to do with territorial expansion .
 Contemporary Ukrainian nationalism, like the nationalisms of other eastern and central European peoples, originates in 19th-century national movements .
 This Soviet identity put down deep roots, particularly in the Donbas region, because ‘nothing much came before it’ (Wilson 2016, p.6), and there was little on which to base a coherent identity divorced from Soviet times .
Recent opinion surveys do not include them. Given the security situation in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasti, recent opinion surveys don't include them .
 eastern and western Ukrainians appear to differ on issues, such as integration into Euro–Atlantic structures and solutions to the conﬂict in eastern Ukraine and Russia . However, eastern and west Ukrainians indeed seem to differ.
 support for the EU in western Ukraine was 83% and 27% in eastern Ukraine . Support for NATO membership in eastern Ukrainian was 21% and 71% in western Ukrainian . support for EU membership in Ukraine was 21%, 21% in Ukraine .
 There is less agreement on how separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions should remain within Ukraine . An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians would prefer Ukraine to remain one country .
 In independent Ukraine, the nation-building process of constructing an overarching national identity became inevitably focused on the past and on the difference between eastern and western versions of Ukrainian identity . The support for independence of separatist regions in Ukraine is minimal .
 The perception of Ukrainians as 'almost the same' as Russians was much more internalised in eastern Ukraine than in the western part of the country where contemporary Ukrainian nationalism originated .
 The difference in attitude toward Russia between the more compliant east and more rebellious west became reduced to ‘pro-Russian’ and ‘anti- Russian’ Ukrainians .
 The assumed division of Ukraine between the ‘nationalistic’ west and ‘pro-Russian’ east obscures the fact that Ukraine is not sharply divided along ethnic or even linguistic lines, and that both east and west are heterogeneous regions .
 What should concern us here is the radicalisation of the ethnic and linguistic divide. What should be concern us are the radicalised of the Ethnic and linguistic divides .
 Popular uprisings tend to unleash nationalist forces of various intensity and intentions . They then invoke past struggles and fears, which then invoke previous struggles .
 The east-west divide descended into the stereotyping of a ‘fascist’ west and ‘anti-Ukrainian, pro-Russian’ east .
 Nation-building elites engage in shaping a state’s identity, which reﬂects a speciﬁc vision of the state and corresponds best with political aspirations .
 The quest for a new identity is particularly important to new nationalising states with an insecure identity . Russia is seeking to restore its regional and international status amidst economic crisis at home .
In times of crisis and threats to the state, an objective historical account is not the aim of historical narrative . In times of crises and threats, a historical account should not be an objective history account .
 The following illustrates that while nationalist elites manipulate historical memory, they do not necessarily fabricate the whole story . But rather, they promote a particular section of the story until the revised version emerges as a dominant narrative for many sections of the population .
 In times of societal unrest and confusion, the main contributor to tension is the politicisation of historical memory . The story of victimisation, injustice and unresolved conﬂicts told in identityrelevant terms .
 The new national identity in post-Soviet Ukraine seeks to extricate itself from Russia and its sphere of interest and leave its ‘little Russian’ status behind . It predictably rejects Ukraine’s Soviet past and embraces the nationalist historical narrative originating in western Ukraine .
 The statements make about the identity of their respective nations are incompatible, in both countries . In both countries, the statements are incompatible and lead to extremes, says CNN's John Sutter .
Interwar national movements undertook extreme violence against ethnic or religious groups they perceived as enemy of the nation . Attempts to rehabilitate such organisations and their leaders have occurred in other post-communist states .
 Yanukovych government abandoned these policies in 2010 . The Yanukovych government came to power in 2010, but abandoned them in 2012 .
Support for these organisations was minimal in the eastern regions, which corroborates the regional division of Ukraine as discussed above .
 Wilson argues that the inclusion of Svoboda in the new government was ‘disastrous’ because it fed the Russian narrative of nationalist takeover .
 The legitimation of violence by ‘ﬁghters for independence’ is thus matched by the criminalisation of the communist regime . The communist regime prevented Ukrainian independence, according to the report .
 The timing of these laws during the ongoing crisis with Russia is difﬁcult to ignore . Historical memory was politicised and exacerbated nationalist rhetoric, which in turn fed into Russian aggression .
 The Russia-Ukraine conﬁciently cannot be explained without accounting for the ever intensifying instrumentalisation of historical narrative, which is translated into fear of possible repetition in the present .
 Political regimes create a context in which a ‘crisis framed’ narrative becomes acceptable, as well as the wars on the former Yugoslavia and by the conﬂict in Ukraine .
 The second dynamic concerns the invocation of victimhood, which was crucial to the commencement of hostilities in the Russia–Ukraine conﬂict . The second Dynamic concerns the invoking of victimization, which is crucial to hostilities in Russia-Ukraine .
 The story of the victimisation of Ukraine during the Soviet era was exacerbated by the pro-Russian Yanukovych government . It failed to prevent corruption taking hold in the newly independent state .
 Russia tried to hold onto Ukrainian assets and denied the country the right to choose its allies . It emphasised its role as the protector of pro-Russian speakers against rising Ukrainian nationalism .
 Russia used to invoke the memory of atrocities committed by Ukrainian ‘ﬁghters for independence’ against Russians living in Ukraine .
 Russia's attempt to block Ukraine's independence did not contradict historical facts about Ukraine’s subordination to Russia. Equally, Russia's attempts to block Ukrainian independence did.
 The Russia–Ukraine crisis started as a popular uprising for democratisation and the Europeanisation of Ukraine . But very soon historical memory of earlier struggles became conﬂated and manipulated into ever sharper division .
There are a number of reasons for the assertion of ethnicity in post-communist conﬂicts, says author . He says there are many reasons for ethnicity in Post-communists .
 Theoretical perspectives on the role of ethnicity in post-communism led me to analyse the politicisation of ethno-linguistic identity . In the post-Soviet space, ethnicity is increasingly used as a proxy for ethnicity .
 My focus was on the exploitation and distortion of this identity into political afﬁliations in circumstances of competing and mutually incompatible nationalising projects.
 Russian nation in ethno-linguistic terms that aids its positioning as a kin-state in an ongoing and ever more aggressive quest to reassert Russia’s regional dominance and its great power status .
 The much exploited Nazi collaboration in western Ukraine is set against the anti-fascist heroism of Russia . The gloriﬁghters for independence in the newly independent Ukraine serves the narrative of victimhood and arrested national development under the Soviet regime .
 Ukraine is seeking to extricate itself from the Russian sphere of interests . Russia is determined to re-establish this relationship, if necessary, by breaching international law .
 This fact tends to eclipse the role of nationalism and ethnicity in this conﬂict, but it does not negate the analytical framework presented here . This fact tend to eclipse a role of nationalism and ethnicity.
 This role was signiﬁcant enough to escalate the conﬂict between Russia and Ukraine . The role was signs of a growing conflict between the two countries .
 The conﬂict between those two long-entwined nations has huge consequences . It is not limited to armed confrontation over borders, it is not only armed confrontation .
