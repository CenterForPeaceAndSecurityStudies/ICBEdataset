Russian meddling in Ukrainian politics has stymied political development . Russian meddling in Ukraine's political development is stymying political development.
 Ukrainian political elites worked hand in glove with the Kremlin before the Maidan Revolution of 2014 . Ukraine used state resources to gain political gains .
 The oligarchic system of governance began to take root in Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union . It was firmly established under President Leonid Kuchma in the second half of the 1990s .
 Under Kuchma's administration, corruption flourished, with Ukraineâ€™s vast state enterprises used as personal and political piggybanks .
 Along the way, Naftohaz was plundered and the Ukrainian treasury along with it . The Ukrainian treasury was also plunders .
 Ukrainian oligarchs bought gas from the monopoly at far below market prices . The gas flows became an arbitrage dream, as company officials colluded to flip cheap gas offered by Russia for re-export at higher prices to Europe .
 In 2005, then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko called for the sale of privatized assets to be annulled . The Orange Revolution unraveled the scale of thievery under Kuchma .
 Kuchmaâ€™s son-in-law Victor Pinchuk and oligarch Rinat Akhmetov acquired the Kryvorizhstal steel factory in 2004 for about $800 million .

 Naftohaz bought 17 billion cubic meters of domestically produced gas at a set price of $53 per thousand cubic meters . For instance, the price was $53 a thousand cubic meter .
 Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman disclosed later that 40 percent of this was diverted through unknown intermediaries close to Yanukovych and sold at $410 per thousand cubic meters .

 Naftohaz was restructured into regional power generation companies that were partially privatized for oligarchs' gain .
 One offshoot, Donbasenergo, was forced into near bankruptcy by Naftohaz subsidiaries, then forced to sell off power plants and privatize 60. percent for below market value .
 The stake was purchased by an offshore Dutch holding company owned by Igor Gumenyuk, a man allegedly connected to Ukraineâ€™s richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov .
 A Ukrainian court agreed the sale was "illegitimate" because only a fraction of its value was realized . In February 2015, a Ukrainian court said the sale of the property was 'illeg legitimate'

 corruption in the gas sector benefited Ukrainian oligarchs loyal to Putin . Corruption in the energy sector benefited Ukraine's oligarchs, according to reports .
 Kuchma and Putin gave exclusive rights to intermediary RosUkrEnergo to sell all gas to Ukraine . In 2004, Kuchman and Putin given exclusive rights.

 Firtash allegedly owned 50 percent of the company with a junior partner and Gazprom the other 50 percent . The company allegedly owns 50 percent. The company has been accused of being in the hands of a junior partners .
 RosUkrEnergo was set up to funnel funds into the hands of Firtash and his allies . Evidence points to the fact that Ros Ukr energo had a role in funneling funds into his allies.
 RosUkrEnergo bought 20 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia at below market prices . It paid $230 per thousand cubic meters, or one-third of what Gazprom charged Naftohaz Ukrainy .
 The Ukrainian press had reported that RosUkrEnergoâ€™s beneficiaries included Mogilevich, who is on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list and lives in Moscow .
 Firtash said it was impossible to interact with a government official â€œwithout also meeting an organized crime member,â€™ he wrote in his cable .
 RosUkrEnergo was a tool to enrich both Russian and Ukrainian elites . It was also used to extend Russian political influence .

Firtash told the Austrian court that before the 2014 fall election, candidates Petro Poroshenko and Vitali Klitschko flew to Vienna for a meeting with him . Firtash said the candidates had flown to Vienna before the fall election .
 Perhaps Firtashâ€™s self-aggrandizing was simply bravado, but perhaps not bravado .
 Some experts maintain that Poroshenko granted immunity to former Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko and Yanukovychâ€™s Chief of Staff Serhiy Lyovochkin .
 In 2005, Kolomoyskyi showed up at parliamentary hearings into re-privatizing Ukraineâ€™s government assets to help pay off its debts .
 Pinchuk denied the allegations and said Kolomoyskyi was trying to stir up trouble in order to get him to drop a $2 billion lawsuit against Kolomoysskyi in London . The lawsuit was over an iron ore asset.
 Kolomoyskyi was rumored to have paid Pinchuk $500 million . Years later, in October 2015, the two supposedly settled their disagreement .

 Jaresko suggested new government of independent technocrats to push through needed reforms . He suggested that the only hope for Ukraine was to lead an independent government .
 Abromaviciusâ€™s resignation signaled that attempts to fix the country will continue to be rebuffed, stalled or sabotaged . Control of the state has not been fully seized back from vested interests, he says .
 The solution is removal of any politician from office who served the old regime before 2014 . The end of immunity for politicians is also the end of the immunity for lawmakers .
Without these radical steps, reforms will likely be slow and ineffective . Without these radical Steps, reforms may be slow, ineffective .

 Soros believes that the country could go bust by 2017, due to the combination of low oil prices and sanctions .
 Putinâ€™s strategy of partial occupation -in Crimea and the Donbas -is turning sour .
 Both are troublesome and expensive, as is Russiaâ€™s support of pro-Russian breakaway regions in Georgia and Moldova . Both are expensive and troublesome, as are Russia's support for pro- Russian breakaways .
 The tide will only turn in favor of Ukraine if its oligarchy is brought to its knees, hopefully without further violence . But the tide will be in favor if Ukraine's oligarchs are brought to their knees, maybe without more violence .
