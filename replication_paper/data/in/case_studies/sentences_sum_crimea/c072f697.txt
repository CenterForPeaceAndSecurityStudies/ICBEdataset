 Kerch Strait dividing the country between its political and economic aﬃliation with either Brussels or Moscow . The EU's Strategy; security; NATO; and Russia’s polar-opposite integration strategies with Ukraine .
 At the same time an intensifying opposition towards President Yanukovich’s leadership was another factor contributing to the deterioration of this crisis .
 A series of scholarly accounts examined the afore mentioned causes for intensifying violence of this conﬂict . The author also examined the reasons for the violence .
 The Ukrainian-Russian confrontation in the Sea of Azov in November 2018 necessitates an assessment of the security implications of this re-intensiﬁcation of a conﬂict which seemed to be frozen for several years .
 The imminent threat is reﬂected in the Ukrainian President’s request for support by NATO and the implementation of martial law . The threat is in the Ukraine's request for NATO support by the President .
 The EU’s response to the Ukraine crisis between the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the renewed Russian-Ukrainian confrontation in the Sea of Azov in November 2018 . This article examines the EU's capacities in providing security in Ukraine .
 Ukrainian President Yanukovich gave in to the coercion by his Russian counterpart not to initial an Association Agreement with the EU at the Vilnius summit on November 28 and 29 2013 .

 The Ukrainian-Russian confrontation in the Sea of Azov on 25 November 2018 is the latest evidence of the severity of security concerns stemming from the Ukraine crisis .
 This article has been republished with minor changes . It has been re-published with minor change .
There are dissonnant scholarly interpretations about who is responsible for the worsening of this crisis . There are dissonant scholarly interpretations.
 Mearsheimer accuses the United States and the EU of having ‘peeled Ukraine away from Russia’ by seeking to promote democracy while spreading ‘Western values’ in allusion to the EU’s diplomatic mission to Kiev .
 The aim of this article is to extend the scope of this debate on the origins of the Ukraine crisis . The aim is to reach out to people who want to know more about the crisis .
 The EU, Russia and Ukraine are responsible for this crisis is obsolete as it fails to examine its implications for European security since the Vilnius summit in November 2013 and the open confrontation between Ukraine and Russia in the Sea of Azov in November 2018 .
 The increasing security concern stemming from these developments does not merely have an impact on Ukraine, but touches upon wide-ranging questions about the EU’s capacities in security and defence policy . NATO's role as a guarantor for security as well as Ukrainian-NATO relations
 Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova did not become NATO members in 2008 . Ukraine and Georgia were not members of the alliance in 2008.
 Ukraine’s exclusion from NATO merits attention in light of the confrontation with Russia in the Sea of Azov . Ukraine's exclusion from the NATO is not the only reason for its exclusion .
 The EU's response to security threats between November 2013 and 2018 was hampered by the absence of a security and defence policy which was adequate to contain both the worsening of the crisis and Russia's uncompromising policy towards Ukraine as epitomised by its ad hoc annexation of Crimea .
 Both the EU applied in the case of Ukraine, such as sanctions, the deployment of a Common Security and Defense Policy mission in November 2014 and subsequent peace plans were insuﬃcient to counterbalance Russia's categorical foreign policy towards Ukraine .
 The articles’ combination of policy analysis and process-tracing enables an examination of potential shifts in the EU’s response to increasing security concerns resulting from the intensiﬁcation.
 The article begins with a concise explanation of the origins of the EU-Russian contestation over Ukraine in the aftermath of the Orange Revolution .
 It then continues with an analysis of the latest Russian-Ukrainian confrontation in the Sea of Azov . It also continues with a look at the latest Russia- Ukrainian clash .
 Ukrainian president's request of military support from NATO seems to be indicative of the limitations of the EU’s security and defence policy in the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation in the Kerch Strait .
 An assessment of this hypothesis will be addressed in the last section of this article . The hypothesis is being considered by the author of the article .
 The EU’s response to security threats during the Ukraine crisis. In seeking to critically evaluate the EU's response to rising security threats since the Ukraine Crisis’ emergence .
 The EU is a provider of security in Ukraine . Its parameters of opportunities, presence and capabilities oﬀer a way to operationalise the EU’s initiatives .
 Both strengths and limitations of the EU as a provider of security are critically examined . In this way, both strengths and weaknesses of the European Union as a security provider are examined .
 An assessment of the EU's capacities of its perceived role as a security guarantor necessitates a simultaneous examination of Russia’s foreign policy towards Ukraine between Crimea's annexation and confrontation in the Kerch Strait .
 This deﬁnition is applicable to the EU’s response to the Ukraine crisis. This de ﬁNition is applied to the European response.
 Russia's deliberate capacity to act was fanned by Russia’s deliberate capacity, as this article will demonstrate. MAASS will demonstrate .
 ‘actorness’ entails opportunity, presence and capability, according to Bretherton and Vogler . ‘Actorness' entails opportunity and presence, they say .
 Some scholars have questioned the EU's ability to operate in global politics .
 Critics have also dismissed alternative deﬁnitions of actorness by stating that they were founded on a state-centric assumption .
 David Allen and Michael Smith used ‘presence’ as an alternative concept to explain the EC’s role in international politics . The EC's role in the European Union is a key part of international politics.
 presence ‘denotes latent actorness’ because it may stipulate responses from non-EU member states, according to Bretherton.
 Other scholars, such as Christopher Hill, criticised ‘actorness’ for its limited explanatory value .
 This article investigates whether there is an inherent gap between the EUs objectives as a guarantor of security in Ukraine . The EU's Global Strategy is described in its Global Strategy on its Common Foreign and Security Policy .
 Bretherton and Vogler’s parameters of opportunity, presence and capability oﬀer benchmarks to examine the EU”s latest objectives regarding the provision of security .
 Between November 2013 and November 2018, the EU was not able to act autonomously by providing security in the Ukraine crisis due to both Russia’s presence and actorness . The EU did not provide security in Ukraine due to Russia's presence.
 The following section describes the origins of the EU-Russian contestation over Ukraine during the Orange Revolution . The Orange Revolution paved the way for a renewed and intensiﬁed confrontation .
 The EU formed a diplomatic mission, which mediated between the incumbent regime and the opposition in Kiev . The Orange Revolution for EU-Ukrainian integration is the legacy of the Orange Revolution .
 The EU's interference was to the detriment of the Kremlin’s wish to see its favourite candidate Yanukovich as a winner .
 Ukraine's relations with the EU intensiﬁed. About a fortnight after the repeated election, deliberations about Ukraine’s relations with EU intensified .
 EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenther Verheugen clariﬁed that the EU did not reciprocate Yushenko's intention .
 EU member states were divided regarding the EU’s development of relations with Ukraine .
 Germany sought to develop a newly established framework for enhanced cooperation with Ukraine . In May 2015, the European Commission's President Juncker made an attempt to end the dissonance regarding Ukraine’s EU membership .
 The EaP's lack of guaranteeing security since the evolving Ukraine conﬂict. In this way, this section provides the necessary background before evaluating the EAP’s lack of guarantee of security .
 Polish and Swedish governments’ proposal for the EaP’s launch was presented to the EU Foreign Ministers in May 2008 . The Polish and the Swedish governments' proposal was presented in April 2008 .
 The EaP revealed defects regarding the fulﬁlment of its objective of being a guarantor for security in Ukraine .
 Four developments reﬂect that Ukraine became a country shaken by multiple con�cticts .
 Ukrainian president’s decision to abstain from signing the AA with the EU combined with an increasingly intensifying opposition towards his leadership . Ukraine crisis was the main components contributing to the Ukraine crisis .
 The most violent demonstrations against Yanukovich's politics and contestation over Ukraine’s future political orientation towards either Russia or the EU took place in February 2014 .
 MAASS referendum carried out by Russia in Crimea in Crimea was evidence of Russia's grip on Ukraine . Russia’s subsequent annexation of the peninsula on 18 March 2014was evidence of Russian grip.
 Third, Russian separatists in Ukraine’s East started ﬁghting for secessionist attempts .
 Malaysian airways were allegedly downed by Russian separatists in July 2014 . MH 17 was the alleged downing of Malaysia's airways by the separatists .
 A consolidation of Russian power in East Ukraine undermines both the country’s territorial integrity and the gradual establishment of a peace process .
 The emergence of an open confrontation between Russia and Ukraine in the Sea of Azov beginning on 25 November 2018 is the latest of a series of examples demonstrating the imminent security concerns resulting from the EU's and Russia's deadlock about negotiating a resolution to the Ukraine con�
 The EaP's lacking framework for providing security will be assessed in the following section . The unfolding of this confrontation and the resulting security concerns in light of the EAP’s lacking framework will be examined .
 EU and Ukraine have not been found to have a mutually agreed approach about their relations . The two countries have divergent aspirations about their partnership .
 Ukraine's prospect of becoming an EU member in the long-term has become almost pointless . Since 2014, a discussion about the possibility of Ukraine’s prospect to become an EU Member has become pointless .
 Ukraine’s accession to the EU is impossible. The continuously deteriorating crisis epitomised by violence, Russian separatists in the East, and the annexation of Crimea by Russia .
 This impossibility strengthened Russia’s opportunity to conduct an aﬃrmative foreign policy in Ukraine . This impossibility strengthens Russia's chance to conduct a� opportunity to conduct an opposition in Ukraine .
 Russia's actorness hampered the EU's action, which was hampered by Russia’s actorness . In this context opportunity is understood as Bretherton and Vogler's deﬁnition of the circumstances shaping the EU.
 Russia’s intention to maintain a crucial role in its relations with the post-Soviet space was stated already more than a decade before the Ukraine crisis and exceeds the scope of intensified relations with Ukraine .
 The Kremlin's ground rules for its policy towards the former Soviet space. In light of the Ukraine conﬂict, one can say that this Strategy established the Kremlin’s ground rules.
 Rogozin criticised the EU’s lack of engagement with the Russian government regarding relations with its eastern neighbours .
 Russian president pressure exerted by Russian president on Ukrainian counterpart . Vilnius summit emerged clear signs of pressure exerted on Ukrainian president .
 European Commission's President Barroso and European Council Van Rompuy praised the agreement for its beneﬁts for Ukraine’s economy . Yanukovich's objections about the AA are a potential attempt to try to change Yanukovich’'s objections .
 Russian policy makers dismissed the widely held perception that the AA jeopardised Ukraine’s relations with Russia .
 Trilateral negotiations might have oﬀered the opportunity for the EU and Russia to reﬂect about Ukraine during and after the Orange Revolution .
 The EU-Russian contestation over Ukraine began when the Orange Revolution began . But the initiation of such a trilateral mediation should have been launched in the immediate aftermath of the Orange revolution .
 At the time of the Vilnius summit, it was too late to build the foundation for a negotiated formula between Russia and the EU concerning integration with Ukraine .
 MAASS conﬂict which re�ctected itself in mutual accusations about their respective responsibilities for the Ukraine crisis .
 A crucial step in seeking to resolve the deteriorating war in East Ukraine was the adoption of the second part of the Minsk agreement on 11 February 2015 . The Minsk deal was signed in February 2015.
 The Presidents of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany concluded an agreement aiming at de-escalating the war . The Presidents agreed to end the conflict in Ukraine and Ukraine .
 The Minsk II agreement sought to address measures of the initial agreement aimed at a cease ﬁre which had been adopted on 5 September 2014 . The agreement seeks to address Measures of the original agreement .
 The OSCE's leverage in the Ukraine conﬂict re�ctected limitations due to the increasing intensity of the con �ctict . Despite its extensive members including states in Europe, Central Asia and North America, the OSCE’s leverage in Ukraine is
 The deterioration of the Ukraine conﬂict and Russia’s grip on the country was exempliﬁed by Russia's annexation of Crimea .
 Ukrainian government's inability to maintain control over its territory as exempliﬁed by Crimea’s annexation .
 This contested statehood as a major impairment in Ukraine’s geopolitical orientation was reﬂected in Sakwa's assessment of the history of post-independent Ukraine .
 He stated that this period in Ukraine was ‘characterised by unresolved and often suppressed questions of national coherence and state integration that in the end undermined both’
 Ukraine's contested statehood, the lacking possibility for EU accession of EaP members combined with the EU’s objection towards further enlargement, were major obstacles in developing EU-Ukrainian relations .
 The ratiﬁcation of the AA by the Ukrainian, the European Parliament and EU member states took place in July 2014 .
 Ukrainian President Poroshenko, President Putin, Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande in February 2015 brought about an amendment of the Ukrainian constitution . Six months later, a set of trilateral negotiations regarding the resolution of the Ukraine crisis were held .
 The latest open confrontation between Russia and Ukraine in the Sea of Azov in November 2018 exempliﬁes that this change of the constitution by referring to a frozen conﬂict in Eastern Ukraine is obsolete .
 The following section will assess this confrontation and its aftermath to demonstrate that the conﬂict is neither frozen, nor limited to Eastern Ukraine as there are wide-ranging repercussions for security . The following part will assess the confrontation and the aftermath to show that the Con�
 EaP failure 2. in Brussels and Riga did not lead to tangible results . The EU’s relations with its Eastern neighbours including Ukraine did not result in tangible results.
 The European Council’s President Tusk acknowledged that ‘frozen and armed conﬂicts continue to prevent development and create hardships in countries.
 The death of Ukrainian servicemen yesterday is just the latest proof of the tragic consequences of Russia's aggression in Ukraine .
 Russia's actions in Ukraine has two repercussions for EU foreign policy. This frank assessment of the perception of Russia’s actions has two consequences for the EU .
 Tusk's statement reﬂects the EU’s acceptance of the status quo of the con�ctict, instead of suggesting the implementation of certain policy mechanisms to deescalate the crisis .
 The lacking identiﬁcation of political means implies the EU’s lacking actorness, its absence of opportunities, presence and capabilities in its response to Ukraine crisis .
 The EU's lacking actorness is also reﬂected in the summit's conclusions . The EU’s lack of actorness has also been highlighted by the summit”s conclusions .
 Both the EU’s passivity and its seeming acceptance of the status quo of the conﬂict is re�ctected in the EU's Global Strategy .
 The strengthening of the EU does neither explain if economic, political or diplomatic strength are implied, nor deﬁnes any mechanisms used to ful�á�l this objective .
 MAASS unable to prevent the Kremlin’s exertion of pressure on Ukrainian government to derail deeper integration with Brussels .
 The EU's inability to make Ukraine resilient to Russia's aﬃrmative foreign policy. This outcome exempliﬁed the EU’s failure to make the country resilient to the Russian foreign policy . The EU has been criticised for its lack of
 The EU's development of an aﬃrmative stance towards Russia is severely challenged by Russia’s actorness in Ukraine . The next section demonstrates that the EU”s development of a� a� strictly attitude to Russia is
 The EU's actorness in responding to this growing security risk merits attention. In light of this confrontation, the need to assess the EU’s actorness, says the EU .
 This article assessed a series of critical junctures in the gradual evolution of the Ukraine conﬂict since November 2013 .
 The annexation of Crimea, the war in the Donbas and the downing of MH 17 increased the EU's pressure to react . Yanukovich’s decision to refrain from EU integration has led to a domestic crisis in Ukraine .
 It started playing the role of an innocent bystander at the time of Crimea’s annexation .
 EU oﬃcials condemned the elections and Russia’s actions in Ukraine . The elections in the Donbas in November 2018 a�ărmed the stronghold of an a ﬃliation with Russia .
 The EU's response to the Ukrainian-Russian confrontation in the Kerch Strait was weak in action . No less strong in rhetoric but strong in action was the EU’s response .
 This is the latest example demonstrating that the Ukraine conﬂict, which so far cost the lives of 10,000 people, is not a frozen con. This is not the first example of the Ukraine Con�ctict .
 The EU is not the primary actor in guaranteeing security due to its lacking actorness. This approach at conﬂict containment seems to be indicative of the EU's lack of actorness .
 This section explains the evolution of the conﬂict in the Kerch strait . It assesses the EU's response to it before contrasting it to NATO's and the OSCE’s role . This section also compares the EU’’
 Ukrainian-Russian open confrontation in Kerch Strait since Russia's annexation of Crimea alert to the severity of the wide-ranging security implications of Ukraine conﬂict .
 Russian soldiers shot Ukrainian vessels in the Kerch Strait and captured 23 sailors aboard of these vessels .
 Russia considers these waterways its own since it annexed Crimea . According to Russia, the transit of these Ukrainian vessels through this Strait was illegal .
 Ukraine undertook similar crossings of this passage, which respects the UN convention on the Law of the Sea according to which shipping can take place in any strait .
 An agreement between Russia and Ukraine in 2003 further legitimised Ukraine’s right to pass via this strait . The agreement was signed in 2003 .
 The Russian Foreign Ministry’s response to the confrontation issued on November 25 echoed a situation on the brink of war . The Russian foreign ministry's response was similar to that of the U.S.
 The Ministry's statement was ‘issu a warning to Ukraine that Kiev’s policy, pursued in coordination with the United States and the EU, seeks to provoke a conﬂict with Russia in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea .
 Ukrainian President Poroshenko requested imposition of martial law for 30 days . In the spectre of this security threat, the Ukrainian President requested the imposition of Martial Law .
 Poroshenko requested NATO’s envoy of vessels to the Kerch Strait during the time of the martial law .
 NATO summit in Bucharest from April 2 to 4 2008 concluded that Ukraine would not become a member state . This plea for support from NATO is a reminder of the summit that concluded Ukraine wouldn't become amember state .
 Ukrainian-Russian confrontation in Kerch Strait has increased security risk within two years . This increase demonstrates the perceived security risk stemming from deterioration of the Ukraine crisis .
 The EU ‘expected’ Russia to ‘ensure unhindered and free passage through the Kerch Strait .
 The rejection of these requests reﬂects the limited coercive capacity Germany and France as well as Mogherini can exert on Russia . Russia can exert its coercive capacity on Germany, France and France .
 MAASS independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders’ But did not explain which means are used to safeguard this situation .
 The statement is strong in rhetoric but not followed up by concrete action . Thus, the statement isstrong in rhetoric, but not follow up by action .
 Samokhavlov refers to the EU's lacking actorness as a security guarantor as oppposed to NATO’s capacities . The EU's lack of actorness is a problem, he says .
 The question of anatgonising Russia is a moot point when Russia shoots at Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov .
 Ukrainian Foreign Ministers plea for extending scope of the OSCE's observation mission . Poroshenko's request for the deployment of NATO vessels to the Sea of Azov is the Ukraine's request .
 The proposal was further discussed at a meeting on December 11 2018 for French-German mediation eﬀorts regarding the latest Ukrainian-Russian confrontation . This proposal was also discussed at the meeting on Dec. 11 2018 .
 The EU's responses to the Ukraine crisis between November 2013 and November 2018 were examined . This article examined the EU’s response to the security threats brought about by the Ukraine Crisis .
 The aftermath of the Vilnius summit in November 2013 resulted in wide-ranging changes to the intended roadmap of EU-Ukrainian integration . Ukraine crisis is one of the factors shaping the evolution of the Ukraine crisis .
 The challenges for the EU to adequately respond to the crisis by containing the conﬂict on the one hand and seeking to coerce Russia’s actions in Ukraine on the other hand .
 The EU has engaged in initiating reform processes within the realm of the EaP . The EU engaged in peace-building and conﬂict resolution prior to Russia's annexation of Crimea .
 Russia's foreign policy capabilities were incapacitated by Russia’s increasing acquisition of actorness . However, since the annexation, its foreign policy capability was incapacitated .
 The EU's continuous eﬀorts at peace-building epitomised by the launch of a CSDP mission in November 2014 . The Kremlin had already created opportunities to maintain its inﬂuence in Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea .
 The EU does not possess the aforementioned elements of actorness, according to the article . This article demonstrated that in its response to security risks resulting from the Ukraine crisis, the EU doesn't possess the same elements of Actorness .
 The EU has acquired presence in Ukraine, deﬁned by Bretherton and Vogler as its ability to exert infuence by shaping perceptions .
 The EU's lack of capacity to respond to the Ukraine crisis has caused a gap between security concerns in Ukraine and the EU's inability to respond .
 Ukrainian political elite turned towards NATO for support in the wake of the Ukrainian-Russian clash in the Kerch Strait .
 The EU lacks the capability to exploit aspects of EU policy constraining external action by Russia by taking advantage of opportunities . The EU does not have the capability.
 The EU cannot take advantage of opportunities due to Russia's creation of its own opportunities, such as the annexation of Crimea and its military response to the alleged illegal crossings of Ukrainian vessels in the Kerch Strait, which incapacitated the EU and the West alike .
 Future research needs to engage in an in-depth discussion about the evolution of the OSCE's and NATO’s engagement in seeking to maintain security in Ukraine .
 The events unfolding in the Kerch Strait are recent. At the time of writing this article, no details on NATO's and eventually the OSCE's and the UN’s engagement is available .
 Interviews with NATO, UN, OSCE and EU oﬃcials regarding their responses to this recently emerged conﬂict will illucidate further strengths and weaknesses of these actors .
 Such an extensive analysis will contribute to a broadening of the debate on the actorness of these international organisations in the issue area of security policy . Such an analysis will help to understand the role of international organisations.
 This will enhance a critical assessment regarding the analytical value of Bretherton and Vogler’s conceptual framework . This is predominantly applied to merely examine the EU's capacities as an actor .
 The EU, the UN, NATO and the OSCE are faced with a capabilityexpectations gap in Ukraine . It is safe to say that the EU and the UN are facing a capability gap in the Ukraine .
