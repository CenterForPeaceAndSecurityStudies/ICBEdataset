Manafort had ample political experience, not all of it was welcome . But he had plenty of political experience .
 Bush had not worked on a Republican presidential campaign since Bob Dole’s failed bid in 1996 . Bush in 1988, but he had not been on the campaign since then .
Manafort instead spent ample time overseas, serving as a fixer for various foreign governments .
Manafort worked for anti-communist rebels in Angola, Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and Zaire’s notorious dictator Mobutu Sese Seko .
Manafort's firm received $700,000 for helping Pakistan’s ISI, which is infamous for its support to jihadist terrorism .
Manafort's open ties to corrupt oligarchs and Kremlin fronts in Ukraine are the cause of his downfall this week .
 Viktor Yanukovych served as the country’s president from early 2010 to early 2014 . He spent several years in Kyiv lobbying for Viktor Yanukovych, who served as president from 2010 to 2014 .
Manafort was critical to Yanukovych’s rise to power, since he coached the colorless Communist functionary in modern politics .
 Yanukovych understood he needed to update his look and message after losing elections in 2004 to the Western-oriented Orange Revolution .
 The Republican consultant taught Yanukovych how to present messages to different audiences . His client won the presidency in January 2010 .
 Once in power, Yanukovych ruled in a distinctly pro-Moscow fashion . However, once in power he ruled in an entirely pro-Russian fashion .
Manafort was there every step of the way, and if he objected to his client's thuggish and corrupt ways, there is no record of it .
 Yanukovych fell in February 2014 when he was impeached by parliament and popular protests convulsed the country . Everything was fine until Yanukovych fell.
 Yanukovych’s thugs attacked protestors in Kyiv, killing nearly a hundred . Some of the shooting of unarmed protestors was done by FSB operatives sent to Kyiv to bolster the ailing regime . His position became untenable and he fled to Russia, where he remains
 It was widely known that Yanukovych spent a decade advising Yanukovych, yet that did not deter Trump from appointing him his campaign manager .
 Trump, who openly admires Putin, perhaps Moscow links were considered a plus .
Manafort’s role in Kyiv, between oligarchs and Kremlin connections, was worse than publicly acknowledged . Whispers continued that he was involved in the Ukraine government .
Manafort guided his new client through the Republican convention in Cleveland last month, winning him the party's nomination .
 Trump stood by Trump as, post-convention, the newly-anointed nominee engaged in a remarkable bout of self-immolation . He stood by him, between insulting the family of a dead American soldier and asking the Kremlin to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails .
 As Trump committed political suicide before the cameras,afort remained loyal and upbeat .
 The Trump campaign denied it had a hand in this rewrite, but this was quickly proven false .
 Trump's bizarre on-camera insistence that Putin is not ‘in’ Ukraine was not “in” Ukraine – despite the presence of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Crimea and the Donbas .
 Anti-fraud investigators in Kyiv discovered a ledger showing that between 2007 and 2012,afort was promised $12. million in off-the-books cash payments by Yanukovych's ruling party .
 At a minimum,afort had served as a foreign agent without registering as one, as required by American law .
 The documents appear authentic and, given the lawyerly evasiveness ofafort's denials, there's no reason to doubt this story . The documents seem authentic and there’s no reason.
 The scandal had not yet died down – including awkward questions about where this vast sum of money really came from – when worse appeared .
 Kilimnik made no effort to hide his Kremlin affiliation, but he andafort became fast friends .
 To anybody familiar with Russian intelligence, Kilimnik was very likely Manafort’s spy-handler .
 At best, he was an access agent for GRU, assessing the American for possible espionage . He was also a possible espionage agent for U.S.
 Trump tried to re-brand his damaged campaign to take on Hillary Clinton in early November . A shake-up this week reduced the seasoned fixer's role .
 The exposure ofafort’s long relationship with GRU was the final straw. The exposure was the last straw, according to a former GRU employee .
 Even Trump for all his overt “bromance with Putin, could not be seen to have such an obvious Kremlin proxy heading his campaign .
Manafort burrowed his way into the Trump campaign as deeply as he did. It is nevertheless shocking that he was involved in the campaign as much as he was .
 America is only now experiencing what Europe has already gone through – a world where parties on both the left and the right are wooed by the Kremlin, which brings cash and favors .
 Germany, with its rich reservoirs of Russlandversteher, is especially vulnerable . Germany's rich reservoirs are especially vulnerable.
 Die Linke retains longstanding ties to Moscow, with whom it shares antipathy toward NATO and the Americans .
 The AfD and others more extreme court Russian favor and sponsorship as Germany looks towards national elections next year . Merkel’s failed refugee policies provide fodder for Kremlin propaganda every day .
 The case of Paulafort demonstrates how Moscow uses money and connections to influence Western politics – even in the U.S.
Manafort's demise this week is a rare case when the public gets to see this messy reality exposed .
 Germans who value their democracy will pay attention as 2017 approaches . Germany is no different – and Germans whovalue their democracy are no different .
