 USing SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEORY to DETECT EARLY SIGNS of SUBVERSIVE THREATS . USING SOCial MOVEMENT Theory todetect theory to determine how people react to each other .
 Few such indicators exist to help defense planners anticipate the onset of subversive activities by foreign adversaries . Well-established indicators make it possible to predict hostile conventional military actions .
 Western societies have often been targeted by adversaries who exploit environmental aspects of the gray zone to subvert the democratic process and influence decision making . Western societies are often targeted.
 The use of non-state actors and social mobilization as well as non-military tactics, such as political, psychological, and information strategies, have frequently escalated to crises due to lack of situational awareness .
 This research provides a brief overview of the gray-zone literature, social movement theories, and social network analysis/social media exploitation . It also provides an overview of how these theories can enhance our understanding of current crises .
 The research uses SMT to conceptualize, examine, and identify early indicators of Russian subversive actions . Based on case studies of Ukraine and Estonia, the research is based on case Studies of Ukraine, Estonia and Ukraine .
Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine and Ukraine, human domain, social mobilization .
 In the 21st century, Western societies have often been targeted by adversaries who exploit environmental aspects of the gray zone . The gray zone is often used to subvert democratic process and influence decision making .

 I must also thank friends and fellow students at NPS who have given me different views and shared experiences during our classes and discussions . I must thank friends, fellow students and other students for sharing their experiences .
 Elin, Valter, and Edvard are the ones who have made this possible . Edvard, Elin and Valter are the only three to make it possible .
 Unconventional warfare, which exploits the gray zone, has evolved to reflect the complexity of shifting global conditions . The gray zone is nothing new, but it has evolved as a result of shifting conditions .
 In the 21st century external actors have often targeted Western societies using nonmilitary tactics and political, political, psychological, and information strategies that take advantage of environmental aspects .
 Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the subsequent conflict between Russia and Ukraine are only two of the current conflicts that have evolved from a grayzone perspective . An external actor has tried to achieve its objectives.
 Russia has been forced to leverage some kind of relative power over former Soviet Socialist Republics of strategic or economic interest . Russia’s continued struggle to regain its superpower status despite lack of a modern military .
 Russia’s use of nonstate actors and social mobilization to facilitate subversion in these recent conflicts highlights the significance of relationships, cooperation, and human interaction, rather than conventional military methods . Russia's use ofnonstate actors, social mobilization, and social mobilized to facilitate
 Russia is dominating the human domain before conflicts arise is crucial. As illustrated by Russia’s campaign in Crimea, it is crucial for the country to avoid conflict .
 The mobilization of existing social networks has become a decisive factor in conflicts . Human domain demands increased attention from any nation seeking to develop or adapt its strategy to deter an adversary .
 learning about social movements and resistance networks can help militaries enhance their situational awareness and force readiness in the gray zone .
 There are well-established indicators for anticipating hostile conventional military actions, and for identifying which indicators play a crucial role in national security defense .
 Few indicators can help defense planners anticipate the onset of subversive activities influenced by foreign adversarial forces .
 Decision makers struggle to understand subversive warfare and lack good analytic indicators for recognizing subversive events in progress . Decision makers fail to recognize subversive events.
 Despite the increasing significance of gray-zone threats, analysts still fail to develop and systematically examine comparable warning indicators .
 Today, a mismatch exists between analyzing military movements and operations, and analyzing subversive operations in the gray zone . Today, the mismatch exists. Today, there is a mismatch.
 The purpose of this thesis is to conceptualize, develop, and examine early indicators and warnings for Russian subversive actions . The purpose is to examine how grayzone conflicts emerge .
 Russia's aggression in Ukraine serves as a model of Russia's conduct in pre-conflict operations. Russia’s aggressive behavior in Ukraine is a model for its conduct in the pre- conflict operations, according to Russian media .
 Russia's strategy in Ukraine highlights the importance of identifying indicators of hostile intent in the period before overt conflict occurs . Russia’s strategy highlights the need to repress such conflicts, but also to thwart an adversary's efforts to influence decision makers .
 The scope of this thesis is limited to the conflicts in Ukraine, since these conflicts are well documented and represent observable patterns in Russia’s current warfare .
 Ukraine case study is then applied to Estonia to assess whether the indicators apply to other cases of Russian destabilization efforts . These findings from the Ukraine caseStudy are then applied.
 The research question that I attempt to answer in this thesis is as follows as follows .
 These are all, in one way or another, theories and methods to examine historical conflicts . But more important, they contribute to greater understanding of current crises and conflicts .
 In this chapter, I first review the literature about gray-zone threats and the challenges these present to society and the armed forces . In the chapter, he first reviews the literature.
 Thereafter, I examine the theories of social movements and revolution . I review how these theories shed light on early indicators of subversion in the gray zone .
 SNA and SME literature are potential methods of establishing grayzone indicators . The SNA, SME and SNA literature are also considered as potential methods .
 Nations are entering a period when they must be able to meet the adversary in an environment “characterized by intense political, economic, informational, and military competition,’s some scholars define as the gray zone . Nations must meet an adversary in a period �
 The definition of the gray zone is widely discussed, and in this thesis, I will not try to develop another definition . The definition is widely debated, but it is not the first time it has been discussed .
 Instead, I try to incorporate the gray zone’s environmental aspects that are critical for mitigating subversive actions .
 Phillip Lohaus argues that recent attempts to define the gray zone have lacked precision . He argues that the lack of precision has hindered nations’ ability to develop appropriate responses .
 Of importance, then, is the context and environment that the gray zone implies, says the author .
 It is the people and its surroundings that are the focus, to influence them in the different areas where they participate, such as in diplomatic, societal, economic and informational areas .
 An Operational Framework for Using Special Operations Forces in the Space between War and Peace,’s Special Operations Journal 2, no. 3 .
 This definition of gray zone implies that the gray zone demands a deeper understanding of the human domain than was required during the historical battles fought between two nations in an overt war . The gray zone is the same as that was required in the historic battles between the two nations .
 Some argue that “the human domain is one of the most critical and challenging aspects’ of modern and future conflicts . Some even go so far as to argue that the human domain.
 The importance of mapping the human domain is explained by the assumption that if we have maps, we can more easily analyze where the areas for influence are great, but also where to analyze for further indicators .
 Social movement theory seeks to explain the environment within crisis through a human dimension focus and how social networks evolve . The theory is based on the human dimension of the crisis .
 To analyze the environment for indicators, one must know how the society looks when it is politically stable . One must understand characteristics in a society that are crucial for influence operations, to be able to analyze.
 One should look for indicators within the areas where successful resistance networks have grown. One should also look for signs of success within the area where resistance networks are growing .
 Derek Raymond stresses the importance of analyzing a society's human dynamics . He examines the key principles of SMT and the conditions that are needed for a successful information operation .
 "Organizational Innovation and Adaptation in the 21st Century,” in Beyond Convergence, ed.
 A Socially Unconventional Strategy. (master’s thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, 2015), is a Socially unconventional strategy .
 The definition of resistance movements is wide-ranging, depending on the context . It can be either an opposition party or an underground network .
 Christopher Fussell and Lee argue that smaller states and nonstate actors utili z e networks to countervail the superiority of big nations . This argument is reinforced by Christopher FUSsell andLee .
 These are important arguments that provide the baseline in this thesis for analyzing the human domain. These are key arguments for analyzing human domain .
We must understand what is normal and then analyze changes in the environment, or more specifically, changes that indicate that someone has tried to influence the environment .
 SNA and SMT are used to better understand the human domain to enhance decision making and assess the potential of actors to influence areas where operations will be conducted .
 SNA can be used as a tool to investigate the connections within movements, and to identify the actors or groups vital to the movements or networks . SNA has been used to identify actors and networks in the past .
 SME is used to explain how information and the discourse within certain areas develops, geographically but also within networks .
 Social Network Analysis to an Unconventional Warfare Framework . From the CORE: Common Operational Research Environment Newsletter A : 8. 5 different methods to analyze them .
 SNA can help identify brokers who could be crucial for influencing the network . SNA also finds people who interact between different networks .
 Whether it is for disseminating information or for gathering supporters, finding individuals who act as brokers between social groups is a key factor in influencing operations .
 This is also important for decision makers in our society because it is these brokers who could be working for an adversary . This is important for decisions made by people who want to make a decision .
 SNA can help you find people who could be engaged in Information Operations . It is possible to observe changes within a network .
 SME supports military planners in viewing differences in the social media sphere . Military planners see growth of certain topics or aggressive style when people discuss these topics .
 SME can be skewed, however, because it is most applicable to youth and well-off areas where the information environment is well developed . SME is more applicable to young people who are not well-developed, however .
 The main criticism of SNA is that it does not gather the necessary data easily . SNA has been criticised for its lack of data collection .
 The specific data includes not only race, age, and gender, but relationships between people, like kinship .
 SNA should not be the only approach when drafting one’s strategy, but should work as a complement to other critical elements in the decision-making process . Nancy Roberts and Sean Everton state in their article, “Strategies for Combating Dark Networks,’
 The SNA method and its result must be modeled for every different network . No single interpretation exists for each measure .
 Data depends on context and the way it is gathered, among other things, says CNN.com .
 6 important part of the process. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA, February 13, 2017 .
 The data should be compared and contrasted to data from other networks and also within its own network to get insights .
 There are indicators, such as ties to foreign institutions and organizations, that can reveal an adversary working subversively . The main player within the gray zone is the people, the people .
 These information operations can influence both the civilian population and also politicians and military leaders . The information operations are often used to influence politicians and the military .
 SNA is a complement to traditional intelligence analysis that covers the characteristic environment specific to the gray zone . SNA was created to provide insights into the environment of a gray zone.
 I argue that we must use this tool to exploit “friendly organizations in a Phase Zero environment to find our adversary, to highlight a structure of previously unknown associations, to enhance understanding of the human domain and its social structure .
 SNA is a valuable tool for decision makers to refine their analysis so they recognize the enemy within this concept and stop him . SNA can be used to help decision makers identify the enemy in their analysis .
 The schools of thought that I have just discussed all contribute to a higher understanding and explanation of crises, says John Sutter . Sutter: "The schools ofthought that I've just discussedAll contribute to the higher understanding"
 What is missing in these discussions is the use of these theories and tools to understand and find the adversaries’ subversive operations in Phase Zero .
 This thesis uses the tools and theories to increase understanding and knowledge about the environment for enhancing planning and preparation . This thesis also aims to identify indicators in the gray zone for recognizing an adversary making subversive efforts .
By doing this, we can enhance our understanding, reinforce our decisions, and act proactively . By doing this we can enhanced our understanding and reinforce our decision, and acting proactively.
 This thesis attempts to create a model that highlights indicators and eventually can anticipate the onset of gray-zone crises . The thesis is based on a study by the University of Cambridge .
 The inductive process involves making many observations of phenomena in the real world and finding powerful statements about how things work in order to create a model .
 The importance of relational data and the impact of information operations will apply, says the author .
 Russia’s hybrid warfare doctrine relies heavily on leveraging and exploiting nonmilitary means and the use of subversive information operations . Russia's hybrid warfare Doctrine relies on exploiting non military means and using subversive information.
 The use of traditional and social media outlets is common. These typically flow through personal or organizational relations, and use of social media is common .
 Relational data capture relations between actors such as people, organizations, and others . This study was based on data that are nonrelational characteristics data, which are not based on attributes .
Using the inductive approach, I carefully reconstruct what has happened in Ukraine . Using this approach to lay out the baseline for environmental conditions and mechanisms that are essential for subversive operations .
 In-depth case study of Ukraine and SMT study of Russian subversion with SMT and theories of Irregular Warfare .
 Using SNA and SME as tools together with the conceptual indicators gleaned from the theories will help to create a model for analyzing society and derive established indicators .
 This study draws from SMT and IW, together with methods like SNA and SME, to examine and compare relationships in a contested environment . Conceptually, this study draws on SMT.
 Ukraine functions as a role model for 18 Peter Sohlberg and Britt-Marie Sohberg, Kunskapens former, Vetenskapsteori och forskningsmetod .
 The current conflict not only reveals information about Russia but also how the environment reacts to Russian influence .
 The research process then centers on SNA and SME as methods to apply to the relevant phenomena that will ultimately reveal indicators for subversive actions . SNA, SME and SNA are used as methods for the research process .
 The technology at the Naval Postgraduate School’s Common Operational Research Environment Lab supports mapping out human networks that are identified as significant for the evolution of the crisis .
 The challenges faced in this environment are many, says the author . It is important that boundaries are placed on the research .
 Often social media accounts are deleted, and social networks are always changing . Social networks are often changing, and many accounts are often deleted .
 This forces us to pay attention to where, when, and what data we find online tells us . We should cross-check significant information with different sources that have both high reliability and high validity .
 The data I use is collected from open sources, which sometimes needs translation due to the use of a language other than English .
 This is always going to be a concern when working with data in another language, but by using reliable translation software, this should be minimized . This should be reduced.
 The study needs to establish a frame for the environment to be able to evaluate the changes that occur and infer what that might indicate . The study is a current event within an everchanging environment .
 This frame evolves by implementing this in-depth case study to create a specific narrative for the different stages of the crisis . This frame evolved by implementing the in- depth case study. This frame is designed to provide a specific story for each stage of crisis .
 The intent of the research is to provide the decision maker with both a method and a list of the relevant indicators of subversion that occur in the society .
 This can provide better situational awareness, but most importantly, can increase readiness to disrupt subversive actions . This can be used to help people find out what to do when they are in danger . This is a good way to get ready for a terrorist attack .
 In recent years, Russia appears to have shifted to the use of various solutions besides overt war with armed forces to achieve its objectives . Russia has also shifted to use of other solutions to achieve objectives .
In particular, it has used subversive operations as part of this strategy . In particular, this strategy has been used in the past .
 SMT describes resistance emergent among people, it is well suited to frame domains in the society that should be in focus . SMT is a good idea for people to focus on their own issues .
 By applying SMT, one may derive theoretical indicators for subversive operations . By applyingSMT, a person may have been able to find out what to do .
 SMT is a new form of social networking. SMT was created in the 1990s to help develop social networks . It is the first time SMT has been used as a social network .
 Using SMT, I derive areas of interest regarding UW strategy and subversion . Second, using SMT. I derive area of interest about UW strategy. Third, usingSMT, we use SMT to look at the future of the U.S.
Third, from those areas, I conceptualize the conditions associated with the early actions of a subversive actor . Third, from that area, he conceptualizes the early action of a submissive actor .
 The importance of understanding social movements or unarmed resistance as early indications of crisis and subversion, he says . He says .
 SMT can potentially enhance decision makers’ and national leaders’ understanding of the environment where subversion is taking place, says author .
 This study uses SMT as a unifying framework for different scholars of emergent movements . This study is based on a study of SMT.
 I begin by briefly and critically discussing three major models within SMT, the classical model, the resource mobili z ation model, and the political process model . I also discuss the politicalprocess model .
 It does not explain how individual grievances evolve to collective movements. Nonetheless, it doesn't explain how individuals' grievances evolve .
 This approach might be useful when explaining why people join a movement but not how movements continue and grow over time .
 SMT is the resource mobilization model that emphasizes the significance of the involvement of the elites to explain social movements . SMT also emphasizes the importance of the role of the elite in social movements.
 It posits that resources are crucial and contain variables that translate individual grievances into organized resistance . It says that resources can be crucial for individual grievances to be resolved .
 Instead of analyzing movements as irrational outbursts, it emphasizes the organized structured mechanisms of mobilization that provide strategic resources .
 Proponents of this theory argue that many movements have not emerged from highly organized and structured masses . They say outside support and resources have not been beneficial to the group .
 This approach might be useful when analyzing the organizational factors and the linkages within but lacks the explanation of a movement’s outer environment .
Political process model used to explain and analyze the environment for conditions that pave the way for social movements is the political process model .
 The political process model argues that a social movement is a political rather than a psychological phenomenon . The political movement is not a political phenomenon, it is a psychological process .
 This means that a life cycle of political processes could be translated into social insurgency . This is the case of a social insurgency, says the author of the book .
 A social movement should be understood as a longitudinal process from its emergence to its decline . It also highlights that a social movement must be understood to be a longitudinalprocess .
 The advantage of using this model compared to the others is that it covers the whole process of the movement rather than specific phases . The advantage is that this model covers the entire process of movement .
 The political process model highlights how ordinary people have the potential to mobilize to challenge the incumbent .
 The political process relies on the assumption that social movements develop in the interaction between different interest groups and the political changes they want to see . The politicalprocess relies on a belief that social movement develops in the interactions between different groups .
 This study uses the political process model because it aligns with the strategy of subversion . This study is based on a political process. It uses the process model to find out what the political strategy is .
 Russia’s military doctrine reflects the kind of warfare that has developed throughout the world . General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian Federation, wrote the article .
 Gerasimov argues that political, economic, informational, humanitarian, and other nonmilitary measures, together with revolutionary protests, attempt to undermine the legitimacy of a target country’s political leadership .
 McAdam's political process model highlights the type of disruptive factors that external actors may want to exploit in order to undermine the legitimacy of the local political process .
 He describes the use of political groups, religious figures, and elections as conditions that can be exploited for disruptive actions . He says political groups and religious figures can be used for political purposes .
 Authors all emphasize the use of an outside actor taking advantage of instability in the environment to influence the political legitimacy .
 Using political process model explained by McAdam will let us highlight the indicators of subversion in a UW environment . McAdam uses the political process models to show how subversion is occurring .
 The Political Process Model. 4 The broad socioeconomic processes are preconditions in society that let other factors emerge, such as economic and diplomatic measures .
 Those social processes undermine the current political structure but also create the preconditions for a sense of inequality or other strains within society that people want to change .
 The political process model identifies three factors that are crucial for a movement to emerge. From these preconditions in the socioeconomic environment, the political process is crucial, says the author .
 Political Opportunity This is explained as openings in the political environment . Political opportunities are explained as opening in political environments .
 It could also be described as the access to the political domain and 34 Me Adam, 51, is also a political domain . It could be called 'access to the Political domain'
 This happens when there is a change of allies and opponents, and the stability of the current ruling actors is questioned . This is when there are changes in capacity, which indicates a change in capacity . This happens in the case of a change.
 In everyday life, there is relative power in society where the leading authorities have the majority of power . Most often due to democratic rules and processes or an authoritarian decision process .
 These rules make it hard for opponents to change society in a way they want, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 One can interpret every change in the structure of the political society as a push for political opportunity . One caninterpret every change as an opportunity for political opportunities .
 This can be an event that changes and undermines the stability of the leading elite or the whole system itself . This is a change in status quo.
 Elections are a typical event when a political opportunity may arise . Current leaders may be questioned by current leaders .
 Political opportunities reduce the relative power between the leading elite and its opponents . The change in relative power makes it harder to repress an opponent .
 Indigenous Organizational Strength to be able to mobilize, argues that one needs already existing organizations to recruit and develop opportunities in the political sphere .
 The political opposition within a country creates a network that in turn can create the seeds of opportunity . The opposition within the country can create a network of opportunity.
 One still needs a network, community, or group in that structure to organize and link people together . However, one still needs to be a network.
 already existing organizations work as a recruitment base from which one can save time by recruiting blocs of people who are already an organized group . Already existing organizations.
 Organizations can cooperate for the same purpose or important question that they want to solve, even if they have other, different objectives . The goal is to solve the same question as the goal of the organization .
 The indigenous organizations create a network with an already existing communication network and experienced leaders .
 The indigenous organizations give the capacity to leverage grievance through their already existing communication network, leadership, members to recruit from, and incentives . The indigenous groups give the ability to leverage grievances through their existing communication system, leadership and leadership .
 It does not matter how much strain or grievance is within the society if no mechanism to organize people exists . It doesn't matter how many people are angry or unhappy with the way they are organized .
 McAdam argues that networks or groups are already in place and that these function as fertile ground for emphasizing incentives to resistance . McAdam says it is essential that networks and groups are in place .
Political opportunities are there as already existing organizations. This implies that so many people must perceive political opportunities that it seems manageable to change their situation and that they are there .
 isolated people must have mass of people to be able to change their situation and believe in it. It does not matter if isolated people perceive that they are unjustly treated, says the author .
 This mass of people makes people believe that change is doable and that they are not alone and have strong personal links to others . This mass makes them believe that changes are doable, says one person .
 Leaders at a strategic level can achieve a greater efficacy determined by how they frame their narrative . Leaders can achieve greater efficacy if they frame the narrative of their story .
 Through framing, they have a measure to control and to influence activists, which encourages recruitment and gains media attention . Throughframing, activists are able to gain media attention, which they use to gain control .
 Analyzing these domains through the lens of the political process may help to achieve specific characteristics and mechanisms indicating subversive actions .
 Subversive operations try to disrupt the current environment within a country to achieve one’s strategic goals .
 By analyzing these domains, one can derive mechanisms that can indicate externally disruptive movements . By analyzing this domain, one could identify externally disruptive movement .
 The political environment in democratic nations is conducive to making a change or influencing internal decisions . Political subversion is also known as political subversion .
 The goal for subversion is to create an unstable environment and conditions essential to influence decision making or to delegitimize the governing authorities . The goal is to make the situation more unstable .
 By influencing a democratic tool such as elections to the parliament, one can achieve a more legitimate outcome . However, by influencing ademocratic tool such a election, one could achieve a better outcome .
 elections are harder to criticize or delegitimize due to the democratic process followed, even though they were influenced by an external actor . These outcomes or results from the elections are hard to criticize.
 Other mechanisms that create political opportunities are major political realignments, changes in the current party structure, splinter groups, defectors and existing parties that divide into several factions .
 This is most common in the time frame of elections but also sometimes when nations are in crisis . This is the most common time frame in the world of elections .
 Economic SMT states that economic downturns enhance movement emergence by leveraging human feelings . Economic downturns enhanced movement emergence, says SMT .
 Economic downturns can create pressure on current authorities to mobilize and motivate people for a change . The UK's economic downturns have created pressure on the government to mobilize people .
 This area can either generate a mobilization but also amplify the resistance . This area has been used as a place to organize and mobilize people in the region .
 Income inequality, unemployment, and other similar factors are sources of systemic strain . Income inequality and unemployment are among the reasons for strain .
 The use of economic measures creates a permissive environment and puts pressure on existing political authority to influence its population, says the author .
 The energy sector also uses its power factor by overtly closing off the energy supply to coerce decision makers to choose energy suppliers as partners .
 It is also an area where resistance networks most often find their resources . It's also an areas where resistance network most often finds their resources.
 Social The social domain is where the emergence of a movement can grow and people find like-minded supporters of the movement . Social media is the social domain.
 It is in this domain that the movement has its foundation for mobilizing people . It is also in the domain that it has its foundations for mobilising people .
This structure is essential to coordinating information and actions across the society . This structure is needed to coordinate information and action across the country .
 The emergence of new socialpolitical movements or minority movements to establish an organizational platform are ways to disturb the current political environment . The emergence. of social political movements or minorities to establish a platform will disturb the political environment, says the author .
 SMT emphasizes the use of already existing networks or groups where there is already an established structure with leadership and members . SMT also emphasizes use of existing networks and groups.
 Indigenous organizations give the capacity for grievance but also a platform for recruiting . Indigenous organizations have a platform to recruit and recruit Indigenous people .
 In the existing groups or organizations, there is already a common purpose or goal they share that can either reinforce or connect groups .
 In this domain, strategic communication can be used to build a counter-narrative to the current political one . In this case, the use of strategic communication could be used in a political battle .
 A minority group of people are victimized and exposed to unjust treatment by the current leadership. One way to do this is to create a narrative that describes a specific minority group as victimized .
 Creating a narrative about how some people are mistreated or how bad the West is, or disseminating information that is pro-Russian, among others, are tools to increase grievances .
 One finds the use of media to create a narrative and shape the information environment in the society to prepare for a decision in which Russia has an interest .
 The informational part can gain popular support, and by that, can legitimize Russian actions . Russian actions can also be legitimized by the informational part .
 In this chapter, I have emphasized the importance of understanding social movements and unarmed resistance as key indications of crisis and subversion . In this book, I will discuss the importance to understand social movements.
 Within those domains, one can identify general mechanisms and characteristics that externally disruptive movements might use to gain power within society . One can also identify general mechanism and characteristics of disruptive movements .
 Events such as major political realignments, oppositional parties and splinter groups, or an existing party’s split into several factions are examples of how political opportunities arise .
 Economic factors such as investments in key industries, such as energy and media agencies, are other mechanisms used to influence decisions . Economic factors include investments in energy, media and investments in media agencies .
 Economic downturns put pressure on current authorities but also help create incentives for those who want to challenge the ruling government .
 The social domain may reveal creation of political opportunity . It focuses on already existing organizations to recruit people .
 The ideological approach tries to gather individual grievances to collective actions through presenting incentives or creating psychological strain . Finally, the ideological approach attempts to create psychological strain by presenting incentives .
 The use of media like the internet and television to disseminate messages and to build a narrative is essential, says the author .
 In the next chapter, these factors are applied to the Ukraine crisis to analyze events in order to derive indicators of potential subversive operations . The next chapter will focus on the Ukrainian crisis .
 Russia’s use of subversion to reach its strategic objectives is well documented in the literature .
 Few have studied early indicators of the crisis in Ukraine . Russia’s objectives are obvious, but many have not been studied .
 Russia’s annexation of Crimea has surprised many nations . 46 highlights the importance of identifying indicators of hostile intent in order to repress such operations .
 Leveraging subversive operations using the human domain has become a key factor . The human domain is a human domain. Leveraging the domain has been used in subversive operations .
 The Arab Spring presents an example of war in the 21st century, says the chief of the Russian General Staff . The use of political, economic, informational, social, and other nonmilitary means has increased the utility of the human domain and the potential of social movements .
Gerasimov’s statements imply that resistance mobilization is a tool for subversion that Russia uses to achieve its objectives . Gerasimov's statements imply resistance mobilization.
 Russian Federation military doctrine states that one of the main internal military risks for Russia is subversive information activities targeting the population . This is reinforced by the Russian Federation Military doctrine .
 Ukraine's political and social environment in Ukraine is a key part of the country's history . The country's political, social environment is also a major part of its history .
 Dividing the events according to those domains makes the different characteristics and mechanisms important for subversive indicators more apparent . The domains make different characteristics of those domains more apparent, according to the authors .
 The political domain and a brief historical backdrop to the political environment contributes to a better understanding of how this framework can be used to influence decision making . The political environment is a brief backdrop to a political environment .
 The other domains, such as economic, social, and informational, are more likely to be affected by political instability .
 The author says the findings might support analysts and decision makers in a contested environment . He concludes that the findings are based on findings in the different domains of established subversive indicators .
After gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has struggled through several crises such as the Orange Revolution and Euromaidan related to Russia .
 They highlight the military aspect of the Ukrainian crisis but lack the analyses of how its political, economic, and social aspects influenced the society and decision makers through subversion prior to annexation .
Russian annexation in early 2014 to reveal indicators of Russian subversion . In this chapter, I analyze events prior to the annexation to Russia in 2014 .

 Christopher S Chivvis, 2017, Understanding Russian “Hybrid Warfare And What Can Be Done about It.’s a Russian ‘hybrid Warfare and What Can be Done about it’
 Russia regards Ukraine as a country in which it has enduring interests . Ukraine is a country with enduring interests, says Russia .
 Ukraine’s geographical position makes it strategically important, especially as a buffer zone between Russia and the West . Ukraine's biggest minority is Russian, and Ukraine's geographical position is strategically important .
 Russians see the expansion of the West as a threat to their interests . They consider every increasing linkage from Ukraine to the European Union as a decrease in Russian influence . This is partly why Russians see expansion of West as threat.
 This has been used both as a carrot and a stick to influence decision making in favor of Russia . This has also been used to influence decisions made in Russia .
 Russia tries to counter the overtures using traditional and nontraditional tools of state power to pressure Ukraine . The EU tries to promote democracy and deepen economic and political cooperation .
 The use of business affiliates and the energy sector are only some of the ways it seeks to influence Ukraine through means other than the use of military force . Russia's policy of supporting and protecting the rights of Russians living abroad, alias its compatriot policy.
 Russia has had a low level of institutional ties with Ukraine . Historically, Russia has used its connections to pro-Russian elites . But this has changed .
 Russia also tries to gain influence through its compatriot policy, which focuses on ethnic Russians and Russian speakers . Russia also has its own own policy, focusing on ethnic Russian speakers.
 Millions of Russians and Russian-speaking people live in Ukraine and will continue to do so . Millions of Russian and Russians live in the Ukraine .
 Russia will always defend their interests using political, diplomatic and legal means . Russia will use political, political and diplomatic means to defend its interests .
This is the guarantee of Ukraine’s state stability and territorial integrity . This is the guarantees of Ukraine's state stability, territorial integrity. This is a guarantee of the country's stability and integrity .
 Its interests in Ukraine rest on many factors, some of which are shared by the EU and West .
 Ukraine is the largest country on the European continent with a population of about 44 million people . The country is the world's largest country, with about 44million people .
 The Russian Black Sea fleet is stationed in Crimea, but also the gas pipeline from the Russian gas company Gazprom to Europe passes through Ukraine .
 Some people see Ukraine as the heart of Orthodox Church history . Ukraine has a long history with Russia, and some people see it as a church .
 About 17 percent of Ukraine’s population is Russian-speaking, most of them in Eastern Ukraine . Russian media outlets are widespread, giving the Russian government a tool to leverage its own narrative .
 Russia’s prerequisites for influencing. What is just discussed and outlined in this section partly explains Russia's interests . But also concludes Russia's pre requisite for influencing .
 Ukrainian society through the different domains derived from SMT where Russian events are the focus . What follows is a theoretical analysis of Ukrainian society.
 Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, and the political system and the ruling government were relatively young .
 The political parties evolved from different subgroups with dissident interests to developed and stable parties after the Orange Revolution and Euromaidan . The parties have strong ties to business affiliates .
 Despite many changes through the years in alliances and party configurations, established politicians have remained the same .
 From 1994 to 2005, then-President Kuchma drove Ukraine closer to the EU . Little protest from Russia was heard from Russia .
 The Orange Revolution turned the EU and its leaders towards Ukraine and the interest in cooperation evolved . The pro-democracy protest in 2004, the Orange Revolution, turned the European Union and the EU towards Ukraine .
 The Orange Revolution and other pro-Westem influences did not fulfill the pledges to the Ukrainian people . The Orange revolution was formed in the 1980s .
 The people had not seen any major changes and were tired of the corrupt political system . The people were not seeing any major change in the political system.
 In Russia, the Orange Revolution was seen as an operation conducted by the West to undermine Russia’s influence in Ukraine .
 The Orange Revolution created an environment of instability and struggle between its backers and the opposition . The Orange revolution created a situation of instability between backers and opposition .
 The EU did not show any greater interest in drawing Ukraine further into the EU . The EU was careful not to push its agenda too hard, in order to avoid conflict with Russia .
 Before 2005, the EU did not engage in any domestic change in the Ukraine political landscape .
 The Ukraine-European Union Action Plan was the first step to connecting these two parts . It was launched in Ukraine in the summer of 2014 .
 The Action Plan was a plan to integrate Ukraine more to the EU and fulfil the demands of a member state . It was designed to fulfil demands of member state demands .
 Ukrainian citizens did not see any greater changes in the country's society . There were no clear incentives for Ukraine to actually fulfill these obligations .
This created a political vacuum where everyone tried to leverage their agenda to attract other parties to form a coalition . This created aPolitical vacuum where people tried to use the power of the party to create a coalition.
 President Yushchenko and the coalition failed to win the election . The election was held in the Russian capital, Moscow, on June 26, 2014 .
 The NATO discussions are still ongoing, though some people, mostly in the eastern part of Ukraine, thought that membership would constrain them from meeting their relatives, many of whom still lived in Russia .
 This situation was later utilized by the Russian government through its compatriot policy . This situation is later used by the government through the compatriot policies .
 Yanukovych did not follow the agreement and began to violate its terms. Nevertheless, Yanukovych didn't follow its terms, he said .
 He became anti-EU and stated that Europe and NATO should not be an option . He said that Europe, NATO and the EU are not an option in Europe .
 The president Viktor Yushenko, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, and the chairman of the parliament, Oleksandr Moroz, decided to dissolve the parliament . The parliament was dissolved by the president and the parliament's chairman .
 This forced them to conduct a new parliamentary election in September 2007 . The election was held in the same year as the previous election .
 Further events highlighted the competition for influence in Ukraine between the EU and Russia .
 The agreements were intended to persuade Ukraine to distance itself from Russia . These agreements were a clear increase in the battle for influence and were aimed at persuading Ukraine.
 DCFTA and BRK-CU were not compatible with each other, which laid out a clear competition between the EU and Russia for Ukraine .
 The situation was a clear incentive for both the EU and Russia to take advantage of the unstable situation in Ukraine, says the European Union .
 The international financial crisis of 2007-2009 had a significant impact on the 2010 presidential election . The financial crisis had a major impact on 2010 presidential elections .
 Viktor Yanukovych’s focus on business-friendly policies, stability measures, and pro-Russian orientation aligned with what the Ukrainian population supported at that time .
Common economic interests, family connections between countries, and shared history were three main reasons important for the election .
 The EU-Russia Relations-Not Just for Ukraine,’ Danube 5, no. 1 .
 The people thought that the Orange Revolution leaders had failed to deliver on their promises and therefore turned against them . The people believed that the people thought they had failed.
 The focus changed slowly towards Russia, and Ukraine’s progress towards integration with the EU halted . The focus shifted slowly towards Ukraine, and the focus changed towards Russia .
 Yanukovych started to adapt pro-Russian policies and moved away from NATO interests . Yanukovych has been in power for more than a decade .
 Yanukovych renewed Russia’s lease of the Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol for 25 years . Ukraine's nonaligned status was determined by laws that determined the country's non aligned status .
 In October 2010, Yanukovych and the constitutional court erased the limits on presidential power, such as naming government ministers . The deal ended the Orange Revolution protests.
 The European Foreign Affairs Review 16: 259. Challenges, Progress and Potential .
 He began to target people that have been active during the Orange Revolution and charged them for different criminal acts . He started to target those who have been involved in the revolution .
 Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, was charged with abuse of state funds . Yuriy Lutsenko was a former minister of internal affairs with close ties to theoshenko . Two of those charged were former PM Yulia.
 Tymoshenko has been an active voice for Western focus and the work against corruption . She was Yanukovych’s main opponent in the presidential election in 2010 .
 This drew great criticism from both the opposition in Ukraine and international observers . This has been criticised by both opposition and international observer .
 In 2011, Yanukovych took some small steps to counter his critics . He hoped by those actions to strengthen relations with the EU and placate the oppositional factions .
 In March, ex-president Leonid Kuchma was charged with involvement in journalist Georgiy Gongadze’s death .
 Gongadze was a critical reporter of Kuchma’s presidency and was murdered in 2000 . He was killed in 2000.
 Kuchma was suspected pretty early, but he could never be charged at that time . He was never charged .
 In April, the main suspects in Gongadze’s killing, Olexiy Pukach and two other police officers, are said to have confessed .
 The parliamentary election was held in October 2012 and had a debatable outcome . Further on, the parliamentary election in 2012 had adebatable outcome.
 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. and EU were skeptical . The United States, the EU, and the United States were skeptical.
 The party United Opposition-Batkivschyna, UDAR, Svoboda, and Our Ukraine did not agree to this . The party did not agreed to this.
 The government abandoned further discussions with the EU and instead signed another agreement with Russia in November 2013 .
 The Russian agreement concerned the Custom Union with Russia, lower gas prices, and a decrease in a loan that Ukraine had . Ukraine had a loan with Russia .
 The abandonment of the AA in November 2013 shifted the focus toward Russia and ignited massive civil unrest . Several protesters and excessive violence from the police were used to constrain the protest .
 In February 2014, President Yanukovych fled to Russia and abandoned the country . President Yanukovych left Russia in February 2014 .
 This was the beginning of the end of several-months-long unrest against corruption . People tired of abandoned promises and people tired of abandoning promises .
 The Ukrainian political environment in its historical context is almost a road map for SMT . SMT explains as political opportunities for the Ukrainian political situation .
 The election system has changed throughout time, and different rules and regulations regarding political parties and coalitions have been introduced . Different rules, regulations and rules are being introduced .
 The institutional environment has changed depending on who the president is, and the power has shifted between the president and the parliament .
 Due to weak ideology, and sometimes to corruption, the loyalty of leading politicians is often questioned .
 Poroshenko has floated between being allied to both pro-Russian and pro-Westem parties . The Ukrainian president has said he will not be seen as a political party .
 Ukraine’s economic ties to Russia are significant . Despite gaining its independence in 1991, Ukraine has significant economic ties with Russia .
 Russia’s use of economic mechanisms as tools for influence has been obvious, according to the author . Russia's use of the economy as a tool for influence is obvious, he says .
 Gazprom is Russia’s largest gas company and provides many parts of Europe with gas . Its main gas pipeline to Europe goes through Ukraine .
In 2006, Russia demonstrated its use of Gazprom as a power tool to influence decision makers in Ukraine . In 2006, Gazprom was used to influence Ukraine's decision makers .
 Russia argued that Ukraine kept some gas for its own consumption and that the price Ukraine paid was too low . Russia said that Ukraine paid too low to keep some gas.
 Russia highlighted the necessity of good relationships with Russia . By turning off the natural gas that it provided to Ukraine and other parts of Europe .
 This seems to be an outcome of the Orange Revolution and enforced a new agreement that was set in January 2005 for another five-year period . The Orange Revolution was set to be held for five years in 2005 .
 In April 2008, Gazprom sbyt Ukraine, a subsidiary to Gazprom, was registered in Ukraine . Gazprom is a subsidiary of Gazprom and a subsidiary.
 This increased Russian influence in Ukraine’s general economic sphere but also demonstrated a more direct influence over the Ukrainian government . This increased Russia's influence in the Ukraine's economic sphere .
 In January 2009, Ukraine and Gazprom cut off gas for many areas, mostly in Ukraine . In 2009, another dispute between the two sides occurred over unpaid bills, which allowed the Russians to cut off the gas .
 Russia's gas prices peaked in 2009 at $230 per 1,000 cubic meters . Russia had kept raising gas prices over several years .
 The increase of the gas price and the level it reached was not what was disturbing because the price Ukraine had paid was still lower than the world price .
 Russia introduced the price increase and disruption of gas production in the middle of the winter that signaled some kind of will to influence Ukraine decision making. More disturbing was how Russia introduced price increase.
 New 10-year agreement signed between Russia and Ukraine was signed last week . In one week, the gas was turned on again .
 The AA with the EU was published in the summer of 2013, and Russia now had the opportunity to read it .
 The agreement clearly stated that Ukraine would no longer be able to maintain the same relationships with Russia as it had earlier . The agreement also stated that Russia would not have been able to stay in the same relationship with Ukraine .
 Russia became more engaged in the discussions about the AA and undertook a coercive stance to deter the Ukrainian government from continuing to pursue these proWestern actions .
 The Russian policy targeted President Yanukovych and his political decisions by exercising influence in the economic sector, more specifically in import and export between the two countries .
 Russia’s restrictive trade measures were a big loss for the companies and industry . They were aimed at forcing Ukraine to cancel dialogue with the EU and instead join the Moscow-led Customs Union .
 All measures taken by Russia in the economic domain created an unstable environment where grievances and polarization among the citizens increased . All these measures taken in the economy created a unstable environment.
 This, in turn, was leveraged against the ruling government in order to influence decisions in Russia’s favor . This is the first time Russia has been leveraged by the government to influence the government .
 Most often, the economic domain boosts social conditions through organizations and corporations linked to Russia . The economic domain is used to disseminate the Russian narrative .
 The economic domain reinforces Russia’s influence among the population. In summary, it reinforces Russia's influence in the population .
 Russia is a tool used by Russia to legitimize its involvement in other countries' businesses and to build incentives for becoming involved in those countries’ political process . This is also known as the compatriot policy .
 The concept of the compatriot policy is to influence both Russians abroad but also people within Russia to gain support for Russia's activities .
 The policy also works as a threat to foreign governments that Russia will interfere if they do not take care of the Russian people . The policy is also a threat.
 In 2007, the Russkiy Mir Foundation was decreed by the Russian president .
 Russkiy Mir is linked to the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation . The House of Lords European Union Committee is a member of the European Union.
 In October 2013, Russkiy Mir announced that they would open three new Russian centers in Ukraine .
 These centers create a platform for disseminating pro-Russian information and give the Russian government a legal, geographical base to engage domestically .
 Today, Ukraine has 11 Russian centers, compared to the United States, which has two, where Russkiy Mir disseminates its messages . The U.S. has two centers, which have 11, which are located in Ukraine .
 Since 2009, the Rossotrudnichestvo and the Russkiy Mir have coordinated their activities and aggregated their objectives . Since 2009.
 Russian government given opportunity to work through its network and physical locations . This has both strengthened Russkiy Mir and given the Russian government the chance to work with the government .
 These organizations build the narrative primarily about Russian culture but more specifically the Russian language . The Russian language is the language of many Russian organizations .
 In July 2012, a law was passed that strengthened the Russian language in Ukraine . The law was strengthened in July 2012 .
 The law stated that Russian should get a regional language status . Many feared that this would divide the country even more .
 Yanukovych and his allies argued that this was a way to get closer to the EU and to follow the rules of human rights in Ukraine . Yanukovych said this was an attempt to follow human rights rules.
 The law has been used many times to depict Ukrainians as Nazis because they do not accept Russian as a second language . Due to the relatively large protests, this law is often used to depict Ukrainian as Nazis .
 Russian media outlets will be able to smear the current leadership, according to the Russian media . Russia's current leadership has been accused of smearing its leadership .
 Russian Soft Power and Non-Military Influence in the Baltic States . 40.5% of Russia's soft power and non-military influence in Baltic states .
 Between 2012 and 2013, it received about $8 million from the Russian government . Between 2012-2013, the government received about £8 million .
 In 2013, there were about 10,000 beneficiaries, three times more than the previous year . The foundation is responsible for Human Rights centers, and in 2013 there were 10,00 beneficiaries .
 These beneficiaries are not official and can be anyone promoting or supporting Russian interests, such as politicians or other influential persons . These beneficiaries can't be official or support Russian interests .
 Victor Medvedchuk is a former Ukrainian politician with considerable influence in current Ukrainian political decision making . He is currently a member of the Ukrainian parliament .
 His many interests in the business sector make him a person with many engagements but also many opportunities to influence people in his areas of interest . His work in the Kuchma administration from 2002 to 2005 is his most successful career .
Medvedchuk has strong connections to the Russian government in general, but more specifically to Putin himself . Medvedchuk is married to Russian President Vladimir Putin .
 In 2012, Medvedchuk established the Ukrainian Choice, a nongovernmental organization . The organization is a reaction to Ukraine's pro-Westem approach .
 It emphasizes the importance of self-determination in decisions like what language to use . The government’s not interfering in personal decisions, self-government, and free choice of territory .
 Ukrainian Choice strongly opposed the EU agreement DCFTA (Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area) and broadcasted what damage would be if Ukraine signed it .
 In 2013, Medvedchuk established the Eurasian Forum in Kiev, partnering with the Russian Youth Public Council, which emphasized the same message . In 2013,. Medveduk also established a Eurasian forum in Kiev .
 Another NGO is the Russian Orthodox Church, which is working to reunite the Russian world .
 The church has a Russian-centric approach, working through affiliated NGOs, various publications, and charity groups, to spread its political issues . The church also criticizes the EU and NATO membership .
 The church cooperates with other religious groups abroad that are affiliated in certain ways to the Moscow Patriarchate . The church is also affiliated with other religions abroad .
 In 2013, the Russian Orthodox Church's own international organization, Day of Baptism of Rus (Den Kreshchenia Rus), launched open-air concerts in ten cities .
 Both have significant funding and have been very active since 2013 . They both have had significant funding since 2013.
 The Night Wolves have close cooperation with Putin, who is a member of the gang . In 2011 and 2012, they held their annual meetings in Crimea .
 Russian Cossack Network taught young people typical military skills, such as shooting and fighting . Another organization had a summer camp in Crimea in 2013 .
 Both these organizations had huge funding and close ties to the Russian government . Both had big funding and ties to Russia .
 Strategic communication used to build counter-narrative can be used to victimize minority groups or describe them as exposed to an unfair situation in the country .
 A narrative describing how a Russian minority is mistreated, dissemination of information that is pro-Russia, is meant to increase grievances and incite people to protest against the ruling elite .
 The ideological factors are mainly disseminated and reinforced by the Russian World concept . Russian World is a Russian World Concept .
 Ukrainian media companies can't get the same impact with less support from the Russian government . These are most often funded by the government, which makes it difficult for Ukrainian media to get same impact .
 Kiev court cancels allocation of frequencies for two privately owned TV channels . The channels were two channels that provided independent news .
 Ukrainian Security Service head Valery Khoroshkovsky applied for new frequencies to his rival media company, Inter Media Group . This also happened in the same period as Ukraine's security service head, ValeryKhoroshovsky, applied to new frequencies .
 Valery Khoroshkovsky is well known for his close ties and his co-ownership of media companies with pro-Russian people . He is also known as a well-known for his business ties to pro- Russian people .
 The Russian government released a policy document emphasizing the importance of building a positive narrative of Russia abroad in February 2013 .
 The document strengthened Russia’s compatriot policy but also highlighted the use of media and other information channels as a tool to disseminate its pro-Russian narrative .
 Influencing people means influencing those who make decisions, says CNN's John Sutter .
 This chapter analyzed how this is applied by Russia when trying to achieve its interests abroad . This chapter also examined how this was applied to Russia's efforts to achieve interests abroad.
 The use of SMT complements the currently available analysis of Russia’s actions by having a population-centric approach .
 The four areas derived from the political process model through UW explain crucial areas where one should look for indicators of subversive actions . The four are based on political process models through UW .
 SMT can be used to analyze episodes of contentious collective actions . SMT is a usable tool to study changes in society and actions taken for influencing people .
 The categories of how to collect and analyze the human environment were mentioned earlier. The categories were also mentioned earlier .
 Russia's way of subverting Ukraine’s political environment and Ukrainian society as a whole . Working through NGOs and in the fog of compatriots and using economic influence, mainly through the energy sector .
 Ukraine has had a lot of political instability and struggle in the society, which emphasizes political opportunities . In the political environment, where many people may have access, one can see that Ukraine has been a very difficult place for people .
 It is a relatively unstable political environment where existing parties have divided into several factions or splinter groups . It is not the first time the parties have been divided into groups or splinters .
 The emergence of culture centers and other NGOs is Russia’s way of maintaining influence without picking up arms .
 The complexity of this crisis highlights the importance of cooperation between agencies and NGOs to better resist attempts at subversion, says the author .
 This chapter’s purpose is to analyze Ukraine prior to the annexation of Crimea and examine how different networks evolved .
 Using SNA to highlight changes in the Ukraine crisis may be useful for anticipating and highlighting subversive actions . SNA may contribute to the understanding of specific indicators in the different domains .
 The case study will analyze how Russia might use its state power tools working beside and through NGOs . It will also examine how Russia may use its power tools to work with NGOs .
 First, it details and describes the network data, its sources, its boundaries, and its relationships . It presents sociograms of the networks. First, the data is detailed and describes its sources and boundaries .
 Next, an exploratory analysis of the network looks at the interactions between Russia and Ukraine and their sub-state actors . The network began in January 2012 and ended January 2016 .
 It investigates whether there were any significant changes in the network during the Ukraine crisis . It also looks at how the network evolved .
After careful consideration of each method to boundary identification, I settled upon a nominalist strategy coupled with a positive and negative communications event definitional focus .
 The goal was to specify the boundaries of the network accurately . Nevertheless, knowing that the goals were to specify, I would most likely succeed using a hybrid approach .
Data is derived monthly from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System dataset . The data is based on the Integrated crisis early warning system dataset .
 The events are essentially quadruples, consisting of a source actor, event type, target actor, and date . These events are basically quadruples .
 The Goldstein score is a value measuring the level of conflict or cooperation in an event . -10 is the most conflictual and 10 are the most cooperative . 10 are most cooperative, with 10 being the most co-operative .
 This time period and range were selected to allow for two years of data on either side of the annexation of Crimea by Russia . The time period was selected for the two years and range of data .
 ORA’s Measure Over Time feature helps identify trends that otherwise may go unnoticed . Social Network Change Detection function can identify “statistically significant’ periods of network change, as well as compare and contrast Russia and Ukraine .
 SNCD support analysts identify periods in which a single measure of centralization has a significant increase or decrease that is not explainable by random fluctuations in the data .
 Total degree centrality is a measure of the number of ties a node has to its neighbors . The number of nodes in a node is based on its number of neighbors .
 The degree centrality value can be directional . In-degree for ties going into the node, and out-degree in the node . The total degreecentrality value is a summary of both .
 Actors or organizations who are linked to many others assume they have access to their ideas, beliefs, and opinions . Actors are assumed to have a high influence potential .
 Those people are identified by the degree centrality in the specific social network . Those people identified by a degree of centrality to the social network.
 The higher values in this metric are equal to more connections to other actors in that specific network . The higher value is equal to the more connections in that network .
 The closeness centrality value describes the path distance between nodes in a specific network . It is also known as the closeness of a network .
 It measures the path distance between each node and may indicate that the node with a high closeness value (i.e.e., is close to many other nodes) It can disseminate information quickly.
 This measurement counts the numbers of ties each node has but weights them by its neighbor’s centrality score . This measurement is based on the number of ties a node has .
 A node’s eigenvector centrality is calculated by its ties to other nodes and their centrality scores . That is, a node‘s eigestorial centrality' is calculated.
 The eigenvector centrality assesses connections to other nodes with high centrality scores higher than nodes that are more on the periphery . Eigen vector centrality is used to assess connections between nodes with higher centrality .
 It assumes that if a node has a neighbor with a high centrality scores it may have high potential influencing that neighbor .
 It equals the ratio of actual ties over the total possible number of ties in a network . The ratio equals the total number of real ties in the network .
 A pair of actors is considered to be unconnected if they cannot reach one another either directly or indirectly . The pair could not reach each other directly.
 A brokerage position within a network indicates that this node may have high influence potential . It could be a source of gathering information between two networks most often needs to go through this brokerage .
 The optimal number of subgroups generally uses modularity as a measure of fit . The optimal numbers of sub groups generally use modularity to measure fit .
 INITIAL ANALYSIS I first analyzed the network from January 2012 through January 2016 . InITIALANALYSis I first analyzes the network.
 This allowed me to identify trends and shifts in the overall structure of the network . This allowed him to identify Trends and shifts. This allowed for him to find trends and shift in the network's structure .
In time, points in time where metrics had shifted dramatically, such as density of the network. Next, I identified specific points that seemed interesting .
 This allowed me to narrow the range of January 2012-January 2016 to August 2013-April 2014 . This allowed him to close the gap between January 2012 and January 2013- April 2014 .
 By narrowing the range, I identified a specific period with the most interesting network-level and nodelevel events shifts . The highest change in total density of the network was the highest change.
 Sociograms of Russia’s influence operations in Eastern Europe network relationships were coded and then visualized .
Network centralization measures the difference between the most central nodes and the rest of the network . Network centralization is a measure of network centralization .
High values indicate that few nodes are very highly connected, and most have very few ties . High values indicate many nodes are highly connected .
Low values indicate that many nodes are highly connected, and most have many ties . In contrast, low values indicate many nodes in the country are very connected .
 There was a total degree centralization of 0.247 in August 2013 and 0.120 in April 2014, indicating that the nodes became much more highly connected with many more ties in April.
 These dates coincide with the change in relationships between Russia and Ukraine during the Ukraine crisis and the annexation of Crimea .
 The study identified the standardization measures and network density as the most interesting network-level measures warranting further investigation . The study is based on the initial analysis of the study .
 This study also investigates standard centrality measures (degree, closeness, eigen vector, and betweenness) and brokerage positions at the node level .
 This section will chronologically describe and visualize and visualize the different analyses and their results . This section includes the analysis and results of the study .
 Throughout that period, 49 different networks among these actors were identified .
 Sixteen networks were in the beginning time period, 17 in the middle, and 16 in the end . Sixteen network networks were at the beginning of the time period .
 Analysis was conducted for both positive and negative network interactions between Ukrainian-to-Ukrainian, Ukrainianto-Russian, and Russian- to-Russian actors .
 Diameter January 2012-January 2016 11.605 30 Positive Interactions Network Avg. Diameter . Diameter is a diameter of 30.605 .
0.205 0.060 0.594 0.225 2.225 1.225. Positive Interactions Total Degree Closeness Eigenvector Betweenness 0.205 1.060 .
 SNCD allows for real-time analysis and can potentially alert analysts as to whether and when a sudden change has occurred in a network . When compared with other sources of Human Intelligence, may explain possible causes for specific events .
 Significant changes are determined to occur when a particular measure varies from a baseline at a rater greater than a predetermined threshold . Significant changes can occur 49 when a certain measure varies.
 August 2013 and April 2014 are two of the most important periods, with the greatest shifts in value . As identified by the measure charts, network density, network centralization, and their corresponding social network change detection, each provides evidence .
 ORA's output can be confusing because it graphs both significant increases and decreases of a particular metric with lines that rise from the baseline . ORA’s output can also be confusing.
 The green line indicates increases in network fragmentation, while the yellow line tracks decreases . Similarly, the green line shows increases inNetwork fragmentation .
 The red, blue, and green lines all cross the threshold (indicated by the red horizontal line), suggesting that significant changes did occur .
 The next step is to determine the time at which each change began to occur in order to identify what factors may have led to the significant changes . The next steps are to determine when each change started to occur .
 SNCD: Time at which a significant change is deemed to have begun to occur is the point where the line leaves the baseline and begins to rise . With S NCD, the time at which the line begins to increase is the time when the line is left the baseline .
 Russia stopped all imports from Ukraine to Russia in August 2012 . In August 2012, Russia stopped importing Ukraine from Russia .
 President Yanukovych resigned in February 2014, when a temporary government was established . This resulted in President Yanukovych’s resignation in February 2013 .
 On March 18, Russian President Putin signed a law that implied annexation of Crimea . Putin signed the law on March 18 .
 Newman Groups is an algorithm that detects subgroups within networks . It compares the pattern of ties between actors to a random network of the same size and density .
 If the level of interconnectedness between some actors is greater than one would expect strictly from random interactions, it is seen as evidence that it is a subgroup within the network .
 Newman’s algorithm identifies groups that make visual sense in the manner that the Newman group exhibits less community structure . The algorithm identifies the groups that Newman's algorithm identifies .
 Blue ties indicate positive interactions, and red ties indicate negative interactions . Blue ties show positive interactions. Red ties show negative interactions.
 Ukraine business and Russian government can be explained by the import embargo . One can also derive a negative tie between Ukraine and Russia .
 These visualizations highlight that there is a similar pattern between positive and negative interactions . The visualizations show that there are a similar patterns of positive andnegative interactions .
 There are both negative and positive ties between the same actors . The majority of ties are reciprocal except for a few, and there are a few .
 The overall weight of the negative ties is much higher than the positive ties, according to the study . But, it also reveals a conflicted environment, revealing a conflicted atmosphere .
There were 15 total nodes, fewer isolates, identified for the period of August 2013 . There were 15total nodes, less isolates .
 Analysis was conducted for network Agent x Agent Negative ties, for network agent x Agent Positive ties and for individual nodes .
 Ukraine’s relatively high score in eigen vector centrality is explained to its tie to Russia . Russia is a highly centralized actor with many ties to other actors .
 The closeness centrality scores are quite even between the top five actors in both table five and six . Every actor has a relatively high potential to disseminate information .
 The analysis confirms only the first more broad analysis of 2012-2016 . Since the negative and positive networks do not differ significantly in scores, these tables look similar .
 Russia's dominance in eigen vector centrality indicates a more negative dissemination of information than Ukraine’s relatively positive. Russia”s dominance in the eigenvector centrality indicate a morenegative dissemination of info than Ukraine's relatively positive .
Russian and Ukrainian governments as central actors, especially due to degree centrality . These tables describe what one might expect regarding the Russian and the Ukrainian governments .
 These are the top-ranked actors in eigen vector centrality. Remarkably, though, these are the highest-ranked actor in the world .
 Only Ukrainian sub-state actors, except for the Ukrainian government, are known . The opposition, business affiliates, private sector, and civilian organizations are the only actors .
 The eigenvector measures eventual influence capability, and in this case may be vulnerable to Russian influence operations . As mentioned earlier in this study, the eigen vector measures eventual impact capability .
 Ukraine and Russian governments are seen as central actors throughout several measurements . These visualizations describe both the Ukraine and the Russian governments as central actor .
 Analyzing the top actors according to eigenvector and brokerage potential, one can derive from the positive ties, that sub-state actors play a significant role .
 The top-ranked actors in the brokerage measurement are civilian actors and private organizations that might have an indirect influence potential . The highest-ranked actor in brokerage is civilian actors .
 During this time, there was a network centralization—total degree of 0.700. During this period, there were a total degree of0.700 .
 The network appears to be much denser, and apparent brokerage roles have disappeared . This represented a major shift in the total number of interactions, both positive and negative .
 This analysis highlights the balance between positive and negative interactions . It shows why this network can be described as conflictual .
 The Ukrainian government is assigned to the same network/cluster as the majority of the Russian nodes . The negative interactions may be explained by the negative interactions with the Russian actors .
 Analysis reveals a path of exclusively positive ties between Ukrainian business, Ukrainian opposition, Russian rebels, and Russian business affiliates . e.C.E. e.R.R.: This analysis also reveals the path of exclusive positive ties.
 The networks are much denser, and there are no well-defined subgroups as in August 2013 . There are no better networks than in 2013, but there are many more networks .
 The Russian and Ukraine governments do still hold a central position, but now the other actors have many more interactions than before .
 There is an increase of both positive and negative ties, but it is difficult to derive any specific conclusions from that . There is a rise of both negative and positive ties.
 The increase of interactions, both positive and negative, and the increase of actors, is remarkable, but also a lack of isolates. Remarkable, however, is the increased of interactions .
 This time frame highlights an event where Russia violates Ukraine’s sovereignty . This timeframe highlights an incident where Russia violated Ukraine's sovereignty .
 In that situation, one may expect a decrease of interactions due to hostility . In that case, one might expect the opposite, that is, the opposite .
 April 2014 Interactions. Eighteen total nodes, less isolates, were identified for the April 2014 period . April 2014 was the first time the nodes had been identified .
 Analysis was conducted for network Agent X Agent Negative ties, network Agent x Agent Positive ties, and individual nodes . Analysis was carried out for network agent x Agent Negative tie ties .
