 Most things regarding the Ukraine conflict in Ukraine are dealt with entirely propagandistic here in Sweden . Most things about the conflict in the Ukraine are not actually true .
 Dagens Nyheter usually lets through an occasional dissident voice, if only to get an alibi and at the same time by contrast enhance the proscribed view . On other issues our â€œPravdaâ€s â €

 One of these two parts rule over the other, even when there is no agreement on such a regime . We obviously find it quite appropriate that one of this two partsrule over the others .
 The suppressed part convincingly argues that the opponent has seized power trough an illegal street coup, spearheaded by Nazi elements, at that time .
Government forces conduct indiscriminate firing of shells and rockets into cities, blowing innocent civilians to pieces, creating hundreds of thousands of refugees . Very little is reported about the way government forces conduct the battles .
 The Russians sent a convoy of trucks with necessities to help those human beings in their neighboring country . But we had the guts to demonize and ridicule the Russians for sending the convoy of vehicles .
 There was much fuss about the first convoy; now at least five more have followed . At least five have followed, obviously giving substantial relief for many people .
 It turned out that the Russians had benign intentions, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "It was a circumstance that immediately killed our mediaâ€™s interest"
 Itâ€™s fascinating and revealing to compare the identical events in Crimea and earlier in Kosovo . The Crimea and Kosovo events are similar to those in Crimea .
 A large group of Albanians wanted to secede from its motherland, USA and EU immediately engaged fully with the secessionists . A part of Serbia was inhabited by a large group.
 The ethnic cleansing in Kosovo started as a reaction to the bombings, not the other way around . Itâ€™s notable that the ethnic cleansing performed by Serbia in Kosovo began as a response to the bombing .
 R2P is a concept invented to justify the violent actions we for the moment are prone to engage in . It was under the auspices of R 2P â€’s responsibility to protect â €€”“A concept invented by R2p to
 Russia deemed Russia for as the most unlawful atrocity in Crimea . We praised ourselves for as morally exemplary in Kosovo .

On this International Workers Holiday in my small town of 10 thousand people there will be a march with perhaps a dozen participants, and a speech by some local Social Democrat .
 The daily topic in our papers is still Ukraine, or rather Putin with his insidious plans to revive Russian greatness from the Soviet era .
 No arguments are shallow or stupid enough not to find their way to the printed pages or web editions . No arguments can be shallow and stupid enough to find your way to printed pages.
 Sweden must increase its military budget substantially, everyone here says . Sweden has to increase its budget substantially .
 The Baltic States, with their Russian speaking minorities, should fear Putinâ€™s next step . The Baltic states should fear the next step.
 Itâ€™s naturally claimed that uprisings in eastern Ukraine are instigated by Putin . The corresponding riots in Kiev, strongly exacerbated by pure Nazi groups, were legitimate protests .
 Letâ€™s assume that we seriously believe Russia is capable to go on willfully conquering countries . We seriously believe that we believe Russia can go on willful conquering countries.
 The question is then only if itâ€™s we or Putin who suffer from insanity .
 If the Russian leadership was collectively suicidal, yes, then it would be plausible to expect any substantial challenge to NATO power .
 We seem to be back in the old Cold War era with its nonsensical propaganda arguments . The Cold War propaganda arguments seem to have gone back to the days before .

 With this background itâ€€™s practically inevitable that Russia had to annex Crimea. With thisbackground itâ €€™S practically inevitable. It’s practically impossible that Russia must annex Crimea .
