 Most governments are regarded as illegitimate by most governments as indiCrimean annexation . Public opinion argued that the transfer was justiﬁed since it reﬂected the survey; Crimean referendum; majority opinion in Crimea .
 The examination of attitudes in Ukraine December 2014 through a representative survey in Crimea conﬁrmed support for territorial transfer . Most residents believed that their well-being would improve as a result .
 Most lamented the end of the Soviet Union but strongly trusted President Putin and his policies as a way to improve the local economy . Most lamented end of Soviet Union, but strongly trusts President Putin .
 Nearly everyone had Russian citizenship less than a year after the annexation . Nearly all of Russia's population had citizenship under Russian rule .
 There was little diﬀerence between the biggest demographic groupings, Russians and Ukrainians, in attitudes and beliefs .
 Tatar minority consistently demonstrated opposition to the annexation, distrust of Putin and supported a return to the circumstances that the peninsula had experienced after 1991 .
 The annexation continues to garner wide popular approval despite international opprobrium and sanctions against Russia . With the exception of this minority, the annexation remains popular .
 It is now ﬁve years since Russia's seizure of the Crimean Peninsula and installation of a pro-Russian local government on 27 February 2014 .
 The then-existing status quo, namely Crimea as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, was not an option . Crimea as a republic in Ukraine was not a choice .
 The people of Crimea, Crimea, it seemed, had spoken with a near unanimous voice . The Crimea people seemed to have spoken with near unanimous voices .
 Crimea wanted their peninsula of Crimea to break from Ukraine and to join the Russian Federation . They wanted to leave Ukraine and join Russia .
 Crimean Supreme Council declared the peninsula's independence from Ukraine on the same day .
 Russian Federation to formally admit Crimea as a republic and Sevastopol as a federal district into the Russian Federation on 18 March 2014 . This cleared the way for the Russian federation to initiate the process of formally admitting Crimea.
 The events that led to Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation are intensely contested . It goes without saying that the events that lead to Crimea being part of Russia are intense contested .
 Russia’s military seizure of the Crimean Peninsula was a disruptive event, shocking to many who assumed such acts were a thing of the past .
 Yanukovych government in Kyiv was overthrown by the Yanukovych government . It was part of a sequence of escalating events that began with country-wide protests against the Yanukovych regime .
 Russian military intervention proved to be the prologue for the annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia . Russia seized the territory of one state by another, the Crimean Peninsula by Russia.
 Russia's Crimean events are highly contested by Russia . Framing Crimean events using this word, of course, is highly contested .
 The government of Crimea, in its account, claims that the peninsula was not “annexed’ by Russia . The Crimea government says that Crimea was not annexed .
 Crimea chose to “reunify’ with Russia through a democratic referendum . Crimea exercised their international right to self-determination and freely chose to " reunify" with Russia .
 President Vladimir Putin claimed in his historic speech welcoming Crimea’s incorporation into the Russian Federation . Crimea was in fact “coming home,” rejoining its historic motherland .
 Any consideration of the conﬂict over Crimea needs to involve an examination of what ordinary Crimeans think about the events of 2014 .
 Caught between claims and counter-claims originating from Kyiv and Moscow, their perspective and agency is often rendered as an appendage to that emanating from these capitals .
Self-serving scenarios of self-determination are central to the storylines coming out of both capitals . At the same time, self-serving stories of ‘the people’ claiming agency by rising up against an oppressive status quo are central .
 Russia intervening to rescue Crimeans from a rising fascist threat from Kyiv and, on the other hand, admirable local self-determination and agency in response to crisis .
 In Moscow-centered view, a “fascist coup,’ aided and abetted by NATO member countries, overthrew a democratically elected president and Ukraine’s legitimate government .
 An agreed plan to diﬀuse the anti-government protests was abandoned in the face of hostility from a radicalized crowd on the Maidan .
 To supporters of the Euromaidan and of Ukraine breaking decisively with Russia, there never was any fascist specter threatening Crimea . To supporters, there were no fascist specters threatening Crimea.
 "Ukrainian people" overthrew a manifestly corrupt government, one shored up by Russian loans and bribes . Instead the “Ukraineian people’s” protests on the Maidan in Kyiv and across the country, overthrew the government .
 Crimeans remain under Russian occupation, and suﬀer signiﬁcant human rights violations . Crimeans are still under the Russian occupation .
 Crimea is a much more complex reality that is frequently ignored in the heated public debate on Crimea . The Ukrainian and Crimean “people’s” agency of the Ukrainian and Crimea ‘people.’ in 2014 is.
 We do so by reviewing academic studies of pre-annexation Crimea and polling data on attitudes of residents to its future territorial status .
 Crimea was a distinctive region within Ukraine, says the authors . Despite inter-ethnic cleavages, there was no consistently majority openly supportive of union with Russia before March 2014 .
 The survey was commissioned in December 2014, nine months after the Crimea referendum that led to Russia absorbing the territory into its state structures .
 Survey shows popular support for uniﬁcation with Russia . Results also reveal complexities normally overlooked by those focused solely on one question .
 The Crimean conﬂict in international aﬀairs today. We conclude by elaborating what we term the “Crimea conundrum’s’.
Strategic analysts and military planners were so taken aback, it is now somewhat surprising that they were taken aback .
 Crimea seems to present enough structural features to make it a permanent potential secessionist region within Ukraine in the post-1991 period . Crimea is the only ethnic Russian majority region in Ukraine, and its large population of retired military .
 It was not viewed as a live secessionist threat for three reasons . Yet, it was not seen as a real threat for the first time .
 Crimea had experienced an active secessionist movement in the mid-1990s . First, Crimea had been in the middle of the 1990s . Crimea was in Crimea's territory.
 Separatist sentiment in Crimea is sensitive to triangular conjuncture of local, state and regional power dynamics .
 The Ukrainian Orange Revolution of 2005 and the August 2008 war in Georgia created possible conditions for the Kremlin to increase separatist sentiment in Simferopol .
 Having that sentiment become predominant, it required overcoming existing institutional and cultural dampeners on its emergence .
 Crimea secured recognition from Kyiv for its own distinctive character by obtaining Autonomous Republic status within Ukraine . Second, after considerable negotiation and constitutional ﬂux, Crimea secured the right to become an Autonomous republic .
 Russian was the language of government in Crimea . It was insecure until the 2012 state language policy law that enabled the local parliament to grant it oﬃcial status within Crimea .
 Third, secessionist tendencies were viewed as inherently dangerous to interethnic relations on the peninsula . Most particularly relations between ethnic Russians and Ukrainians were seen as dangerous .
 The small number of academic studies of public opinion attitudes in preannexation Crimea pointed to three important features of Crimea . Crimea is now part of Crimea.
 Crimea has long been a prize for diﬀerent groups and power centers . Crimea has a distinctive geographic location with a storied past .
 Crimean Tatars and Slavic residents of the region have been at odds for decades . This quality made for longstanding tensions between Crimean Tatar and Slavs .
 Crimea was an attractive retirement destination during Soviet times . Crimea had many diﬀerent groups migrating to the peninsula .
 Crimea’s mythic sense of place gave its Slavic residents a way of identifying beyond binary contrasts between Ukraine and Russia, Ukrainians and Russians .
 Survey research suggests residents tended to do so when asked potentially binary questions about belonging . Survey research suggested residents tended.
 Most Crimeans responded to the question “what is your homeland” by naming their region ahead of Ukraine, the Soviet Union or Russia .
 Second, like many contested places in potentia but not actively convulsed by conﬂict, the everyday sense of nationhood among Crimeans was variable . Third, like most contested places, the daily sense of countryhood among crimeans wasvariable .
 The ﬁrst, what she terms “discriminated Russians,” was composed of those who actively identify as ethnically Russian .
Distinct from this group were “ethnic Russians, whose sense of identity was culturally Russian but comfortable with living in Ukraine .
 A third category were those who identify as Crimeans which they deﬁned as bridging an identity between the binaries of ethnicity and territory . A third were those  who identi�aked ﬁrst and foremost as Crimean which theyde�
 The fourth category she identiﬁed were ‘political Ukrainians’ Those who embraced a civil nationalist vision of Ukraine as a state of many diﬀerent ethnicities .
 "ethnic Ukrainians" were those with a more exclusivist sense of Ukraine organized around the Ukrainian language and a strongly anti-Soviet vision of Ukrainian history .
 Knott’s study is limited in its number of interviews . It remains unclear how representative or how sizable her categories are .
 It does not address the everyday sense of nationhood of Crimean Tatars on the peninsula . Further, it doesn't address the daily sense of the nationhood.
 Third, the variable salience of nationhood among Crimeans translated into historically shifting aspirations for its political status . The variable saliences of nationalhood in Crimeans translate into aspirations for political status.
 The history of public opinion on the peninsula since 2008 reveals variable levels of support for joining Russia . The history. of public support for Russia since 2008 has been revealed .
 Studies from the mid-1990s show majority sentiment for joining Russia among the Slavic population . But quite diﬀerent attitudes among Crimean Tatars, say studies .
 In 2011, he appointed a close associate and former interior minister Anatoly Mogilev as Crimean prime minister . He has been in charge of Crimea since 2011 .
 Mogilev brought in a team of outside political managers . The team was nicknamed the “Macedonians’ by locals after their hometowns of Makeevka.
 Tension between "outsiders" and "local politicians" was persistent but not unusual, says CNN's John Sutter . "Local politicians" were persistent, Sutter says .
 Leading proRussian activists like Sergei Aksyonov and Vladimir Konstantinov were players in the local political economy . They nurtured further ambitions of their own .
 Crimea is a bastion of opposition to the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the Euromaidan movement . Aksyonov and Konstantinov maneuvered for support from the Kremlin .
 Critics of Russia’s actions often point to public opinion polls before March 2014 as indicating majority sentiment in Crimea was not secessionist .
 Majority sentiment toward the Euromaidan protests in Crimea was overwhelmingly negative and separatist feelings rose . The Eurom Maidan protests endured and radicalized in Crimea .
 In February 2014, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology conducted a nation-wide poll in Ukraine . It asked respondents about their attitude toward integration with Russia into a single state .
 This scenario was supported by only 12% of respondents across Ukraine, a rise of 3% since the Maidan protests began in November 2013 .
 41% of respondents favored this scenario in Crimea, up from 35.9% a year before . In Crimea, 41% favor this scenario, but this was up from 34.8% in 2013 .
 Critics of the annexation point to this as evidence that majority sentiment in Crimea was against joining Russia before Russian intervention .
 The number of respondents from Crimea in this survey was small as it was a national, not a Crimea-only survey .
 Crimea joining Russia might have elicited a higher ratio than the 41% supporting the integration of all of Ukraine with Russia .
 The media surveys carried out by the Gallup organization in Crimea before and after annexation supports this change of media direction . The media survey was carried out in Crimea.
 The Kremlin was monitoring local sentiment about Crimea since the start of 2014 . It became known that the Kremlin was attentively monitoring local sentiments .
 Patrushev wanted data on this possibility and its local support basis to present to Putin . Putin wanted to present the data to the Russian president .
 Some opinion poll data immediately prior to the March referendum were published in Russia . The referendum was held in March .
Up to 83% of Crimean residents were ready to vote for joining Russia in the forthcoming referendum . For example, newspaper headlines on 12 March 2014 announced that up to 83%.
 Both the reported turnout and the aﬃrmation of 97% in favor of joining Russia exceeded the CB-SAM survey expectations .
 The eﬀort was to increase the ratio of supporters of annexation at the polls . It was to raise the number of people supporting annexation in the country .
 The voting was a controlled spectacle designed to simulate self-determination by the people of Crimea . But 8 J O’LOUGHLIN and G TOAL said the outcome did not reﬂect majority opinion on the peninsula .
 Russia and its local allies took no chances with the referendum to ensure the outcome they wanted . Russia's local allies did not want to see what they wanted in the referendum .
 Crimea's election oﬃcials. That outcome may have reﬂected not unanimous sentiment in Crimea, but majority or near evenly-divided sentiment .
 The poll may have been illegitimate and ﬂawed by established democratic standards . But it may nevertheless have been experienced as legitimate by most residents of Crimea .
 It was seen as a foundational legitimation act by the renamed State Council of Crimea and the Russian Federation . It was, of course, certainly seen as an act of legitimation .
 The Levada center hired them to conduct the survey using KIIS’ usual random sampling approach for door-step in-person surveys . KIis already had interviewers on the ground in Crimea and maintaining their long-established partnership .
 The selection of households in each sampling point was carried out by means of a random route method .
 The interviewer polled every 17th household from the list of all resident households . With a prescribed starting point, the interviewer polled all 17th households .
 If the respondent refused to take part in the survey, interviewers proceeded to the EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY and ECONOMICS 9 next address in the list of households of this electoral district . The respondents were asked to answer questions about their electoral district.
 The selection of the respondents in households was made with the consideration of quotas by gender and age . The selection was made by the selection of people in households .
 Survey was completed between the 9th and 22 December 2014, approximately 9 months after annexation . The survey was completed in December 2014 .
 Of these completed surveys,184 were re-contacted by the Levada supervisor to check that the surveys were completed as planned and reported by the interviewer .
 Levada estimated that the margin of error was 2.5% at the .95 level of conﬁdence . Levada estimates that the error margin was at 2.4% . The error margin is 2.6% of the error level .
 We have no indication of the socio-demographic characteristics of those who refused to take part in the survey . There are no indications that those who did not take part are more likely to do so .
 In the survey, 64% selfidentiﬁed as Russian, 9% as Tatar, 21% as Ukrainian and 6% other or mixed nationality .
 These ratios compare to the data of the October 2014 census conducted by the new authorities . The ratios are based on the data from the new government .
 Crimea saw signiﬁcant out-migration, especially by ethnic Ukrainian residents after March 2014 .
 Outmigration has deﬁnitely been counter-balanced by in-migration from Russia .
 In our analysis, we report weighted results to take account of the discrepancies between the 2014 census and the sample .
 Our results on key questions such as support for annexation match others conducted in the period after March 2014, thus increasing conﬁdence in our results . Our results are based on key Questions such as Support for annexation matches .
 This survey of 1,659 adults nation-wide found sentiments that were very diﬀerent there than in other regions .
 A majority of respondents in Crimea, for example, supported the right of regions to secede .
 Almost three-quarters supported both Russian and Ukrainian as the oﬃcial languages in Crimea .
 A post annexation survey in February 2015 by the German market analysis company, GfK, indicated general satisfaction with the outcome of the events that resulted in Crimea’s 10 J O’LOUGHLIN and G TOAL annexation .
 The sample reported similar results in terms of the material status of the Crimean population . The sample also showed similar results.
 ZOIS data indicated that 2.7% could not aﬀord food . 26.5% could buy necessary things (ours was 22.7%) and 57.5%. Only a tiny number in both samples could a�Éord everything .
 The ZOIS survey indicated that “the regional identity category krymchanin has gained further in signiﬁcance, where one might have expected a strengthening of the identi ﬁcation .
 61.4% chose this identity as an option for Crimea . We oﬀered “inhabitant of Crimea’s’S Crimea as a choice .
 Many of the ZOIS questions showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences between Crimean Tatars and the rest of the population . The Tatars remained skeptical of the republic's administration and Russian control of the peninsula .
 respondents are expected to provide answers which are consistent across the multiple dimensions of interest .
 Respondents who trust Vladimir Putin would logically be more supportive of Russian military actions in Crimea and the Donbas . Respondents would be supportive of Russia's actions in the Crimea and Donbas.
 In order to see the overlap between the measures, we computed Cronbach’s Alpha .
 A reliability coeﬃcient of .70 or higher is considered ‘acceptable’ in most social science research settings . A reliability of . 70 or higher was considered “acceptable” in most research settings.
 The Cronbach’s Alpha for the 75 attitudinal EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY and ECONOMICS survey was .721, a helpful indicator that respondents answered them consistently for local and international topics .
 This Cronbach’s value then allows us to select a few key questions for detailed examination . The questions are selected as a way to represent the deeper dimensions of beliefs across the peninsula .
 A principal components analysis of the 75 questions is based on values and correlates on a single attitude score . We chose this strategy to the alternative, a principal component analysis .
 Respondents can dodge questions by outright refusal to answer or by giving a “don't know’s’t know” response . Responders can dodge question by outright refusing to answer.
 In many cases, "don’t know" answers can legitimately reﬂect a lack of knowledge on the topic or a diﬃculty in answering a question .
Examining the pattern of missing values and imputing them allows both a determination of sensitivity to certain topics and a clariﬁcation .
 Surveys in Crimea are apt to be criticized both because of challenges of access and diﬃculties in meeting proper survey protocols .
 A consideration of missing values and addressing such cases through imputation methodologies provides both transparency in survey information and proper attention to missing values . The use of imputations methodologies can be used to address missing values in surveys .
 The “don’t know’s’ ratios for sensitive questions were typically higher for the Tatar sample than for the other two main groups, selfidentiﬁed Russians and Ukrainians .
 The Tatar “don’t know’s’ ratio was 15.6% compared to 1.9% for Russians and 7.0% for Ukrainians .
 The Tatar ‘don’t know’ ratio was 9.4% compared to 1.1% for Russians and 3.8% for Ukrainians . For the question on whether their attitude towards Putin had changed in the past year, the Tatar’s �
 The Tatar “don’t know’s’ ratio was 15.6% with the comparable ratio at 7.7% for Russians and 10.8% for Ukrainians .
 The “don’t know’s’ ratio for Ukrainians occupied a middle ground between the low ﬁgure for Russians and the higher   Tatars for Tatars .
 The answers on the questions are aligned with a speciﬁc group, MNAR . At the other end of the spectrum, it is also plausible that the data are MNAR.
 Little’s test and CDM analysis for the attitudinal questions of interest in the Crimean survey indicated that the data follow a MAR pattern . The data was rejected at the .01 level .
 CDM analysis examines the pattern of missingness according to the key demographic groups . Tatars most likely to give ’don’t know’ answers were Tatars .
 The analysis focuses on three dimensions of post-annexation attitudes in Crimea . Our measures consider political, identity and material perspectives in Crimea.
 The aggregate results in Crimea indicated that 15.3% thought that the end of SU was a right step, 73. 3% thought it was a wrong step, with 11.2% ‘don’t know’ and 0.3%. 11.
 48.4% of Tatars rating the end of the Soviet Union a right step, compared to 11.5% of Ukrainian respondents and 11.7% of Russians . The diﬀerence between Tatar and the two other main nationalities was sizable .
 Central Asia suﬀered by the Tatars during the Soviet period . The repression and deportation to Central Asia was the reason behind such attitudes .
 Tatars returned in greater numbers to the peninsula in the 1990s . Their parliament was re-instituted in 1991 after Ukraine gained its independence .
 In practice, most people have layered or multiple identities that combine these elements in complex ways, as was argued by authors who studied pre-annexation views .
 In this paper, we examine responses to a key question about whether the respondent considers him/herself to be a Russian citizen . The paper also examines responses to the question about the respondent's status .
 The answers to the other identiﬁcations did not elicit as strong a divide between demographic attributes . In our analysis, we focus on the “Russian citizen’s question EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY and ECONOMICS .
 Crimea is now part of the Russian Federation and is part of Russia's Federation . Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014 .
 One month to opt out of citizenship rule, one month to proactively opt out . In order to exempt oneself from this rule, a person had only one month.
 Cross-tabulations of the three main nationalities show that 98.1% of Russians, 91% of Ukrainians and 62.5% of Tatars agreed that they are Russian citizens .
 89.1% of Russians, 86.6% of Ukrainians and 89. 1% of Tatars agree strongly with this identiﬁcation . Unlike the variation by nationality on that option, there is near unanimity and agreement across the nationalities .
 The identiﬁcation – ‘Soviet person’ – also showed the distinction between the Tatar sample and the other two major groups .
 While 46.8% of residents agreed with this Soviet characterization, the ratio was only 25% for Tatars which contrasted with 46.2% for Russians and 46.7% for Ukrainians .
 35.7% of Ukrainians in the sample reporting that they are retired, compared to 27.6% of Russians and 12.5% of Tatars . The relatively high ratio for Ukrainians on this option might be related to their retirement status .
 Older people in surveys across the post-Soviet realm typically identify more strongly with the Soviet tradition than younger cohorts . Older people are more likely to identify with the Russian tradition.
 The question about “trust in Vladimir Putin’s’ Putin was central to the Crimean annexation .
 The individual responses on this trust measure showed high correlations with key geopolitical developments and ramiﬁcations throughout all aspects of respondents' lives .
 Putin was seen as the architect of the annexation and as the instigator of Russian geopolitical interests and actions in the region . Putin was also seen as an instigator in the Donbas .
 The modeling that follows uses a logit approach for a binary outcome . In our case, the end of SU was a right or wrong step, b. Russian citizen or not, and c. “strongly trust” Putin or not .
14 J O’LOUGHLIN and G TOAL we use only demographic measures, nine in all . We use just demographic measures .
Average marginal eﬀects to indicate strength of individual predictors . To clarify the relative importance of each measure, we calculated average marginal e-ects .
 Average marginal eﬀects show the strength of the respective predictor in shifting the outcome variable from 0 to 1 while holding the other predictors constant at their average value . Average marginale�aeects are more likely to shift the outcome of the
For a scaled measure such as age, the eﬀects of a change in one year of age independent variable are calculated . For a scaled measures such as Age, the e�aeects are calculated .
 graphs in the three ﬁgures show the marginal eﬀect estimate with the respective errors of .05.05 .
 When the error line does not cross the horizontal zero line, the estimated value of the predictor is signiﬁcant at this level of con ﬁdence .
Post-Soviet surveys ask respondents if they expect to be “better oﬀ’s in two years . This ratio typically rises and falls with the economic outlook of individual well-being prospects .
 Of the sample, 79.9% of the sample answered aﬃrmatively to this question . Another marked contrast between Tatars and the other two major groups . a.A.
 The general evaluation of the legacy of the Soviet Union was made through the question on whether its end was a right or wrong step . The question is whether the end of theSoviet Union was a wrong or right step .
 Tatars showed a signiﬁcant positive relationship with the outcome . The average marginal eﬀect 20% more than non-Tatars in the sample .
 In general, those who believe that their post-1991 material and social lives have worsened evinced a nostalgia for the Soviet system .
 54% of an all-Russian sample were Russian citizenship . This is far from unique to Crimea since at the time of our survey, a similar belief about the beneﬁts of the Soviet system was supported .
For Ukrainians, possession of Russian citizenship was also less likely than the comparative group . For Ukrainians, the eﬀect was marginally signiﬁcant . For Russians, the difference was slightly less likely.
Other demographic factors were unimportant in this determination as Russian citizen or not . Other demographic factors are also unimportant .
Not counting those who already held Russian passports before March 2014 . It is unclear whether respondents considered this question to be a purely legal deﬁnition or something more important .
Most Tatars in the sample seemed to be deﬁant to the new geopolitical situation by refusing to take on this citizenship . Most Tatars seem to be De�áant to new geopolitical situations by refusing.
 Tatars who said they did not have Russian citizenship did not consider themselves to have that status as an indication of opposition to the concept . We cannot be sure that those Tatars in the sample who said that they had Russian citizenship actually went through the legal exemption procedures .
 Average marginal eﬀects for nine demographic predictors of “Russian citizenship’s” Putin .
 Average marginal eﬀects for nine demographic predictors of “Deﬁnite trust’s in Vladimir Putin . Average marginaleﬄects are for nine demographics predictors.
 Ukrainians were also 10% less likely to “deﬁnitely trust’s’ Putin than non-Ukrainians .
 The relationship between age and “deﬁnite trust’ in Putin was marginally signi ﬁcant with each year of age adding 0.2% more trust in the Russian president .
 "optimists" are more likely to trust the architect of the change in political control from Ukraine to Russian .
 Optimists were 26% higher in their support of the annexation at 89% than non-optimists at 63% . Optimists are 8% more likely to deﬁnitely trust Putin .
 The signiﬁcant gap between the beliefs of Tatars and the other major groups is the clear message from the models and other indicators of demographic groups .
 Much of the political commentary in the wake of the annexation has focused on how the political status and overall quality of life for Tatars changed from the years of Ukrainian rule .
 Russia's parliament has been suspended by the Russian authorities since April 2016 on grounds of “ethnic extremism” Many activists have either been arrested or been arrested .
 Many Tatars showed themselves in our survey as having strong doubts about the developments after 2014 . As a small minority, many Tatars are under suspicion by the new regime .
 By avoiding some particularly sensitive questions, and by responding in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent ways that their Slavic neighbors, this distinctiveness was evident .
 The smaller diﬀerences between Ukrainian and Russian respondents are undoubtedly related to the composition of the Ukrainian population on the peninsula . Older cohorts, military retirees and people in ethnically mixed marriages.
Tatar population has not shown the same kind of distinctive and mobilized politics as the smaller Tatar population . In this respect, they diﬀered from Ukrainians in the rest of the country .
 One hundred states voted on 27 March 2014 for a resolution aﬃrming the territorial integrity of Ukraine . The resolution calls on states, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any change in the status of Crimea or the Black Sea port city of Sevastopol .
 Few states have endorsed Russia’s intervention and subsequent absorption of former Ukrainian territory .
 Even longstanding Russian allies like Belarus have sought to avoid taking a stand on the issue . The issue has been a long-standing issue for Russia .
 Most states see Crimea’s annexation as something to be robustly condemned . Instead, most states see it as something that should be condemned .
 Ukrainian President Poroshenko said Russia grabbed Crimea, then turned Donbas into a battle . Poroshenko also said Russia continued its aggression in the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and the Kerch Strait .
 To Poroshenko the circumstances that lead to Crimea’s annexation and occupation were a mockery of self-determination under international law . Poroshenko says the circumstances leading to Crimea's annexation and Occupation were a mock-up to self- determination .
 Aksyonov in power and rushing through a secessionist referendum without democratic consultation, thus not allowing time for deliberation and fair conditions for debate . No self-determination by Crimeans after proxy Russian forces arrived in Russia .
 A profound disjuncture between the authorities and the population exists, says the author .
 The Crimean people are in silent opposition to Russia’s plundering annexation. The operational assumption in such analysis may well be driven by wishful thinking, says the author .
 Crimea presents the conundrum Crimea presents in contemporary international aﬀairs . This disjuncture of attitudes, and perceptions of legitimacy, is a conundrum for Crimea .
19 current residents of the peninsula question or regret the annexation . At present, there is no indication that a majority of EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY and ECONOMICS are concerned about annexation .
 Researchers would do well to acknowledge this as an essentially contested issue in international aﬀairs rather than a subject that immediately requires recitation of a standard litany of plots by the opposing sides .
 The majority of Crimea residents appear happy about this fact and want it to stay there . The foundations for contemporary and future peaceful resolution can only be built by acknowledging this .
 Russia's annexation of Crimea may not have widespread legitimacy but at this point in time it has it where it counts, within Russia and within Crimea .
