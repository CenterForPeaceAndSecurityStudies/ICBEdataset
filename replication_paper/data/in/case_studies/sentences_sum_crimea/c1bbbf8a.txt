 Prior to 2014 Ukraine was able to avoid a war and a break-up . However, in Donbas; separatism; public contrast to post-communist countries such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and former Yugoslavia .
 This study examines the role of separatists, the Yanukovych government, the Maidan opposition and Maidan government . Russia, the US, the EU and the EU in the conﬂict in Donbas .
 Kyiv International Institute of Sociology uses survey to analyse public support for separatism in Donbas . It uses a specially commissioned survey by the Kyiv international Institute of sociology .
 All these actors contributed in various ways to the conﬂict in Donbas, which involved both a civil war and a direct Russian military intervention since August 2014 .
 Study links this conﬂict to the ‘Euromaidan’, speciﬁcally, the government overthrow by means of the Maidan massacre, and Russia’s annexation of Crimea .
 The KIIS survey shows that support for separatism is much stronger in Donbas compared to other regions . The break-up of Ukraine is unlikely to extend to its other parts, the survey says .
 Since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has experienced signiﬁcant regional divisions concerning major domestic politics and foreign orientation issues . The research question has been asked since its independence in 1991 .
 An earlier version of this paper was presented at a Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies conference in Edmonton in October 2014 .
 Most of the previous studies examined such divisions before the 'Orange Revolution' and the ‘Euromaidan’ However, they did not analyse the war in Donbas and separatism.
 The violent conﬂict in Donbas, along with the ‘Euromaidan, and the secession and the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, have brought new attention to the issue of regional divisions and separatism in Ukraine .
 A conﬂict emerged in Donbas after the violent overthrow of the Yanukovych government during ‘the Euromaidan’ in February 2014 .
 Pro-Russian separatists seized power in most of Donbas and proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic in early April 2014 . Pro- Russian separatists – with the direct involvement of armed Russians – took power in Donbas .
 The Donbas war is not only a major political development that affects the future of Ukraine . It is not the only major political developments that affects Ukraine's future .
 The conﬂict became a major international con��ctict between the Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War . The biggest con� conﬁict between Russia and West since end of Cold War was the biggest since the
 The war in Donbas involved a direct and indirect Russian military intervention . The war involved adirect and indirect Russia military intervention.
 More than 1.7 million internally displaced people registered in Ukraine and more than one million refugees from Donbas in neighbouring countries, primarily Russia .
 The war in Ukraine is very relevant to the EU because Ukraine is one of the largest European countries . Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian natural gas to many EU member states .
 The direct participation of German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Francois Hollande, as well as Russian president Vladimir Putin in the negotiations concerning this conﬂict highlights the international signiﬁcance of this war .
 The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has been involved in negotiating the Minsk agreements . It also shows the signiﬁcance of the war to European countries beyond Ukraine .
 I will seek to determine why Ukraine has experienced a violent conﬂict in Donbas . I will try to find out why Ukraine is experiencing a violent Con�ctict in the region .
 Study analyses the role of different actors and factors in the emergence of this conﬂict and its escalation into a war .
 The analysis relies primarily on Ukrainian, separatist, Russian, and Western governmental, as well as online media, live broadcasts, videos, and other sources concerning conﬂict in Ukrainian, Russian and English .
 Study analyses support for separatism in Donbas compared to other regions of Ukraine . The study also uses a brief survey, commissioned by the author and conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology .
 Disparate narratives regarding the conﬂict in Donbas. There are many con��cticting narratives about the con ﬉ict in the Donbas .
 The Ukrainian government, the national media and the West present the violent conﬂict in Donbas as led, from its beginning in Spring of 2014, by regular armed Russian military units and Russian military intelligence agents .
 The governments of Ukraine and the US, top NATO ofﬁcials, and the mainstream Western media typically claim that Russian military and intelligence units were leading the separatist in Donbas from the beginning .
 Both NATO and Petro Poroshenko stated that there were some 9000 Russian regular troops in Donbas . There were some 9,000 Russian troops in the region .
 Ruslan Kotsaba, a Western Ukrainian journalist, was arrested and charged with treason for opposing the draft and calling the war in Donbas a civil war . Such references are nearly absent in the major media in Ukraine, which is mostly controlled by the oligarchs or government .
 Public opinion concerning the war has thus been affected to a signiﬁcant extent by the government propaganda and media coverage of the war .
 Ministry of Information Policy was created in Ukraine to disseminate government propaganda and shape coverage of the war in Donbas in the media and social media .
 A signiﬁcant minority of Ukrainians share the Ukrainian government and media propagated view that the war in Donbas is a war between Ukraine and Russia .
 In contrast, polls by the Levada Center show that in Russia minorities of the respondents believed that this is a war between Russia and Ukraine .
 The majority of Russians back pro-Russian separatism in Donbas, mainly in the form of independence from Ukraine or the incorporation of these regions into Russia .
 The Ukrainian and Western governments and the mainstream media generally characterize separatism in Donbas as having a minor support and present the results of a referendum held by separatists after they seized power there as not re-ecting public preferences .
Ukrainian government has legal power to suppress separatism by force . They also emphasize that the Ukrainian government has the legal power. They say the government also has the power to stop separatism.
 The central government denies responsibility for civilian casualties during the war . The separatists themselves are killing residents of the cities and villages in which they were based .
 The U.S. and other Western governments generally ignore civilian casualty ﬁgures, claim a lack of evidence to determine responsibility for deadly attacks .
 separatism has widespread popular support in all Eastern and Southern Ukraine . They argue that separatism is widespread support in the Ukraine .
 Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to this part of Ukraine as 'Novorossiya' The region's historical name belonged to the Russian Empire .
 separatist leaders and commanders stated that they intended to expand their control to other regions of ‘Novorossiya’ and even to overthrow the central government of Ukraine .
 The Russian government has consistently denied that its regular military forces were involved in the Donbas conﬂict . The government has repeatedly denied that it was involved .
 The Russian government and media and separatist leaders have attributed civilian casualties in Donbas to Ukrainian forces . A Malaysian passenger plane was shot-down by Ukrainian forces in the area .
 A Russian government investigative agency has launched an investigation into the 'genocide of the Russian-speaking population' in Donbas .
 Academic studies show similar differences in deﬁning the nature of the Donbas conﬂict and its main factors .
 Other studies characterize the conﬂict as a civil war along with Russian military intervention which they deﬁne in various ways . Other studies characterized the con ﬁtict as the civil war.
 The Uppsala Conﬂict Data Program is classiﬁes the con�ctict in Donbas as intrastate .
 Separatism in various forms in independent Ukraine has persistently manifested itself in Crimea, in Donbas, and to a lesser extent in some neighbouring regions . Separating in various ways in independent Ukrainian regions has been seen in Crimea .
 Pro-Russian separatist leaders and parties were in power in Crimea in the ﬁr�rst half of the 1990s .
 Separatism also emerged in Donbas during the same time period, but it always had weaker support there than in Crimea . Separism also emerged during the time period.
 Most ignored such issues as insigniﬁcant, or argued that even though Ukraine was divided along regional lines, it was unlikely to experience a violent regional conﬂict leading to secession .
 The attempt to proclaim an autonomous republic in the East and the South during the ‘Orange Revolution’ was seen as thoroughly contrived .
Until the beginning of 2014, Ukraine was able to avoid a violent conﬂict and break-up . In contrast to other post-communist countries, such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine avoided a violentcon�
 Yanukovych government abruptly changed its decision to sign an association and free trade agreement with the European Union . Mass anti-government protests started in Ukraine at the end of November 2013 .
 The conﬂict escalated and turned violent around 4:00 am on 30 November . Special police units violently dispersed a relatively small group of protesters on the Maidan .
Mass protests against police violence followed on 1 December in Kyiv City . The mass protests against the police violence took place in the country's capital .
 In addition to peaceful rallies, they included seizures of the Kyiv City Hall and the Trade Union Building . A violent attack led by radical nationalist and neo-Nazi organizations and football ultras .
 Yanukovych attempted again to disperse protesters on the Maidan by force and adopted laws restricting the freedoms of assembly and protest .
 At the end of January, the far-right elements of the opposition led an attack on the parliament .
 The attack escalated the conﬂict, and it resulted in a violent confrontation and a stand-off with the special police and interior troops units .
 Maidan opposition leaders initially condemned the 1 December and the January attacks as ‘provocations’ Yanukovych resorted to negotiations with the pro-Western opposition under pressure from the protesters and the Western governments .
 The Maidan Self-Defence and the Right Sector attempted to storm the parliament during a ‘Euromaidan’ opposition march .
 Special police units and ‘titushki’ dispersed and beat both violent attackers and peaceful protesters .
 At least several protesters were killed as a result of this dispersal and a stampede . At least three people were killed.
 concealed shooters started to use live ammunition against both protesters and the police during these clashes .
 About two dozen protesters were killed on 18 and 19 February . Nine Berkut policemen and Interior Troops servicemen were killed .
 The opposition-led protesters also seized regional administrations, police, and security services headquarters in Western Ukraine and some other regions .
 A truce deal was negotiated between Yanukovych and the opposition leaders . The deal was reached after Yanukovych and opposition leaders agreed to a truce .
 The leader of the Right Sector threatened to oust the government after midnight on 20 February . He said his organization did not accept this truce and threatened to use force to oust government .
 If Yanukovych had implemented initial plans to use force, including live ammunition and military units, this would likely have resulted in a large number of casualties among the protesters . A full-ﬂedged uprising in the opposition stronghold in Western Ukraine, and likely civil war .
In order to preserve his power, he agreed to a compromise deal with the opposition . He negotiated with the participation of the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Poland, and a Russian government representative on 21 February 2014 .
 Yanukovych was ousted from Kyiv and then from Ukraine after radical elements of the ‘Euromaidan’ opposition reneged on the compromise agreement .
 The U.S. government and major EU countries de facto backed this violent overthrow of the relatively pro-Russian government by reneging on 21 February deal and immediately recognizing the new government of Ukraine .
 The potential involvement of the US government or governments of the EU states in the Yanukovych government overthrow requires further research . The issue of the potential involvement in the overthrow of Yanukovych requires more research .
 The violent overthrow of the pro-Russian government was a tipping point in the conﬂict between the West and Russia over Ukraine .
 President Putin used this overthrow and its backing by the governments of the U.S. and EU countries to radically change his policy towards Ukraine .
 The Russian government started to pursue secession of Crimea with the help of direct military intervention since the end of February 2014 . The annexation of Crimea by Russia by Russia in March 2014 in a violation of international law .
 Russian backing of separatism in Crimea and annexation of Crimea also encouraged separatists in other regions . Donbas, Kharkiv, and Odesa also encouraged by Russia .
 The mass killing of the protesters and the police that resulted in the overthrow of the Yanukovych government was also a critical juncture in the separatist rebellion .
 Unarmed and armed separatists seized and occupied regional administrations, security service, and police headquarters in Donetsk, Luhansk, and other cities and towns in the regions .
 Igor Strelkov and other members of his armed group of Russian nationalists arrived from Russia via Crimea via Crimea . They seized police headquarters in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the Donetsk Region on 12 April 2014 .
 The local police and security services either refused to offer armed resistance to the separatists or sided with them to various degrees .
 A careful review suggests that much of the evidence regarding direct Russian military intervention during this initial period was misrepresented or even fabricated . The review also suggests that some of the information regarding Russian military action during this period was fabricated .
 Strelkov and members of his armed group in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk were identiﬁed by the Ukrainian and U.S. governments as a Russian military intelligence unit . For example, Strelk and his group were identified by the
 Strelkov was a retired ofﬁcer of the Federal Security Service . However, publicly available evidence indicates that he was retired .
 In both Donbas and the ‘Euromaidan’, foreign governments alone could not have been able to covertly seize power .
 Russia initially supported separatists in Donbas by allowing volunteers and weapons to cross the border from Russia . Evidence indicates that, in contrast to its direct military intervention in Crimea, Russia originally supported separatists .
 The Russian government also threatened to use military force in Ukraine . It deployed large numbers of its military personnel near the border with the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions .
 The Strelkov-led Russian nationalist unit and the local separatists also tried to seize control over local airport and telecommunication infrastructure and nearby towns . The separatist unit and local separatists tried to take control over the airport andtelecommunication infrastructure .
Government forces launched the ‘ATO’ in the East on 13 April 2014 . These attacks lead to counterattacks by the government forces, which refused to consider a peaceful resolution .
 The Maidan-led government attempted to neutralize the separatists through the use of military force and special police and security units . The new Maidan government has been trying to neutralise the separatists .
 An SBU ofﬁcer was killed on the same day during an attempt by an SBU special Alfa unit to seize the separatist leaders in Sloviansk . The group was then controlled by the Strelkov-led armed group of Russians and local separatists .
 Many of the government forces were initially reluctant to follow the orders to use force against the separatists . However, many of the military forces were reluctant to following the orders .
 paramilitary units and special police battalions were organized by the radical nationalist and neo-Nazi organizations . They were more ideologically motivated and willing to use force .
 Various evidence indicates that the Right Sector was involved in a deadly attack of a separatist checkpoint in Sloviansk on 20 April 2014 .
 The special police battalion Dnipro, organized with the participation of the Right Sector, was involved in this attack and in another deadly assault in Krasnoarmiisk in early May 2014 .
Far-right organizations have constituted a minority of the Ukrainian forces during the war in Donbas . These far-right formations were disproportionally involved in the violent violence against civilians and prisoners of war .
 Small numbers of volunteers and mercenaries served in Ukrainian far right-led units . The US, Belarus, Canada, France, Italy, Russia, Sweden, and the US also served in Ukraine .
 The violence by separatists and the central government also had major roles in escalation of the conﬂict into a full scale war .
 A separatist attack on 22 May 2014 resulted in the death of 16 Ukrainian army soldiers near Volnovakha . 16 soldiers were killed in the separatist attack .
 The Poroshenko government launched a large-scale military operation against separatists on 1 July 2014 after a brief truce .
 A daily examination of various live broadcasts, videos, and media reports shows that the separatist leaders, commanders, and members of their armed units, were mostly residents of Donbas .
Volunteers and mercenaries came to Donbas directly from or via Russia or Crimea . But a signiﬁcant number of volunteers and mercenaries also came to donbas .
 The analysis of the same numerous sources indicates that these included mostly Russian nationalists, Russian Cossacks, Chechens, Ingushes, and Ossetians . Other post-Soviet states, Serbia, and Western countries were also included .
 Russian military intervention in Donbas began at the end of August 2014, sources say . The Russian government has continued to deny the Russian government .
 Several battalion-size units took part in incursions in order to prevent a defeat of separatist forces and attacks .
 The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine released satellite images of Russian military vehicles on the Ukrainian side of the border . These include reports by separatists, videos of Russian soldiers and equipment .
Some regular Russian units also took part in the Debaltseve battle in February 2015 . Similar evidence shows that some regular Russian troops took part.
 The Russian forces were usually involved in the combat from a distance, such as shelling the Ukrainian positions from artillery .
 There are videos and other evidence that they started shelling of the Ukrainian positions from the Russian territory near the border in July 2014 .
 There were also reports from different sources about incursions of regular Russian units in Donbas in Fall 2014 and August 2015 .
 Indirect evidence of Russian military intervention includes a rapid change in the military situation in Donbas in August 2014 and February 2015 .
 Ukrainian forces had been retreating from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to the more densely populated parts of Donbas .
 Ukrainian regular units and special police and far right-led volunteer battalions suffered encirclements, retreats, and losses in the Illovaisk and Debaltseve areas, respectively .
 President Poroshenko rapidly reversed his reliance on military force against separatists . In both cases, he negotiated the Minsk ceaseﬁre agreements and he negotiated an agreement .
Changes in the top leadership of DNR and LNR in mid-August 2014 preceded the Russian military intervention in Donbas .
 Alexander Borodai, the prime minister of DNR, is replaced by Strelkov, the defence minister of the DNR . Local separatist leaders are also replaced by local separatist leaders .
Regular Russian forces have not been corroborated directly and indirectly by the analysis of the various sources . In contrast, a similar direct military intervention by regular Russian forces before August 2014 and permanent presence and continuing direct involvement in combat of signiﬁcant regular Russian military forces has not
 Ukraine became a U.S. ‘client state’ after the ‘Euromaidan’ and during the conﬂict in Donbas .
 There was nearly perfect alignments of Ukrainian and U.S. government positions concerning major foreign policy issues, including the war in Donbas .
Top U.S. government ofﬁcials generally expressed unconditional backing of the Ukrainian government policies . The United States provided free of charge military training and military equipment to the Ukrainian forces .
 The U.S. government and other Western countries have excluded the possibility of direct military intervention in the war in Donbas . But the United States government and others have excluded any military intervention .
 separatist republics in Donbas became de facto client states of Russia at the end of summer 2014 . There is evidence, including separatist sources, that suggests that the separatists became de de facto clients of Russia .
Almost all separatist units in Donbas were brought under the de facto overall command of Russian military ‘curators’ or advisers .
 Most of the original separatist commanders in charge of such units, including Strelkov, were forced to leave Donbas for Russia .
 The violent conﬂict in Donbas can thus be deﬁned as a civil war with both direct and indirect military intervention of a foreign state . The violent Con�ctict inDonbas can also be seen as a war with the direct and indirectly military
 The predominant involvement of local separatists at the start of the conﬂict, along with the prevalence of local residents along with residents of other Ukrainian regions among the leadership and in the armed formations, points to this origins of this civil war .
 Russian government's indirect support for separatists, and subsequent direct military intervention, came after the start of the conﬂict in Donbas .
Ukrainian forces have been fighting separatists in Donbas since the start of the war . Ukrainian forces have not been able to recapture all of Donbas . This intervention also proved decisive in enabling the separatists to turn the tide of the conflict .
 The separatist conﬂict in Donbas is in many ways similar to violent crimes in other post-Soviet states, such as Transdniestria in Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
 separatist movements in these countries emerged in regions populated by ethnic minorities . Like in Donbas, separatist movements have emerged in these regions .
 The central governments of these countries also refused to offer autonomy to these regions . They relied on military or police forces and paramilitary units to suppress separatism .
 Russian military intervention in Abkhazia and South Ossetia failed largely because of military interventions by Russia . Russia in the form of the Russian 14th army in Transdniestria, and Russia in Transdiestria . Georgia in 2008.
 Armenia intervened militarily and directly in the Nagorno-Karabakh conﬂict. Similarly, Armenia intervened in the region .
 As of the end of January 2016, the minimum estimate of direct casualties of the war in Donbas is around 13,000 people killed .
 UN report of at least 9098 conﬁrmed casualties in Donbas as of 15 November 2015 . The UN report is based on the UN report.
 The minimal estimated number of killed members of Ukrainian military, National Guard, police, Security Service, border guards, and paramilitary units is around 4000 .
 This estimate is based on ofﬁcial reports of their casualties, updated with media reports, and adjusted for missing in action who are presumed to be killed .
 There have been estimated a few hundred casualties among members of the far-right formations . In addition, there have been estimates of several hundred casualties .
 The casualties among armed separatists units, including Russian volunteers, are estimated to be at least 2500 . No large-scale casualties from encirclements and shot-down military planes and helicopters .
 A rough estimate of killed Russian regular troops in August 2014 and February 2015 is close to 100 . The Russian army was involved in ﬁghting in August and February 2014 .
Thousands or tens of thousands of people in Ukraine are likely to be indirect casualties of the war as a result of higher mortality ratesg. The numbers are difﬁcult to estimate more precisely because of lack of data .
 Attacks on Luhansk, Stanytsia Luhanska, Horlivka, and Donetsk involved multiple civilian casualties from both shelling by Ukrainian regular forces and far-right battalions of both rebels and civilians .
 The separatists or Russian forces were responsible for the most of the most deadly attacks during their advance in January and February 2015, such as shelling of Volnovakha and Mariupol .
 There is also evidence to suggest that a separatist or Russian crew shot down Malaysian passenger plane MH17 in July 2014 .
 This analysis and common political science deﬁnitions show that genocide, fascist junta, and terrorism are not appropriate terms to de ﬁne the conﬂict in Donbas . This analysis shows that genocide is not appropriate term to de�
 A national survey, excepting Crimea, conducted for the author by the KIIS in April/May 2014, indicates much higher levels of popular support for separatism in Donbas than other regions of Ukraine .
 majority of Donbas residents backed various forms of separatism in April/May 2014 . It shows that the majority of residents backed different forms of separatistism .
 support for separatism in different regions of Ukraine, according to the 2014 KIIS Survey . Support for separatistism in Ukraine is on the rise in recent years .
 Many separatist leaders in Donbas called for federalism and regional autonomy in Ukraine .
 The Russian government also pressed for federalism and de facto confederation . Donbas would have given Donbas power to block decisions of the central government .
 23% of respondents in Donbas favoured autonomy as part of federal Ukraine, compared to 8% supporting independence of their region . 23% favoured the region joining Russia, while 23% supported joining Russia .
 A 2015 KIIS survey produced similar results in separatist-controlled Donbas . A 2015 survey produced same results in separatists-controlledDonbas .
 The 2014 KIIS Survey also shows that ethnic Russians in Ukraine, with the exception of Crimea, were split on the issue of separatism .
 Similar percentages of ethnic Russians supported preservation of the existing unitary system . 16% who preferred their region to join Russia .
 No major political party in Ukraine openly supports separatists in Donbas . No major national political party openly supports the separatists .
 Support for separatism by major ethnic groups in Ukraine, the 2014 KIIS Survey, per cent . Support for separatistism by the Ukrainian government is on the rise .
 2014 KIIS Survey: Support for separatism by major languages in Ukraine, per cent. Support for separatistism byMajor languages by major language in Ukraine .
 Determinants of support for separatism in Ukraine, 2014 KIIS survey, OLS regression .
 22% of respondents did not intend to vote, but 22% expressed secessionist views . 12% supported regional autonomy as a part of a federal state in Ukraine .
Residents of Donbas expressed much stronger support for separatism than other regions . The 2014 KIIS Survey data shows that when other factors are held constant, residents of DonBas expressed stronger support .
 Pro-separatist views there were also stronger than in neighbouring regions of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia . Dnipropetrovsk, Kharksiv, and ZaporizHzhia were also strong.
Being a Russian speaker, education level, and settlement type did not have any positive impact on support for separatism . Residence in other major historic and geographic regions, other political party afﬁliation, other religious confession, was not a signi�
 Separatists, the Yanukovych government, the Maidan opposition, and far-right organizations contributed to the start and escalation of violent separatist conﬂict in Donbas, and the de-facto break-up of Ukraine in different ways .
 They all misrepresented the conﬂict in Donbas to various extent, but their actions did not all have an equal impact . The con��ctict was not the same thing that happened .
 The presumed covert involvement of the United States and Russia, the former in the violent regime change during the ‘Euromaidan’ in Donbas, requires further research because of lack of publicly available data concerning these events .
 Regional political culture in Donbas and Russian ethnicity were strongest determinants of support for separatism in Ukraine after the annexation of Crimea .
 Study suggests that it is almost impossible in the foreseeable future to permanently resolve the conﬂict in Donbas and thereby to unite Ukraine once again .
 It is far more likely that this war can either turn into a frozen conﬂict, similar to Transdniestria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh, or the violence can once again escalate .
 The civil war in Donbas has already led to the de facto independence of the DNR and the LNR . The LNR control the most populated parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions .
 Alongside the annexation of Crimea, we are witnessing the de-facto break-up of Ukraine .
 KIIS survey shows that separatism has signiﬁcantly higher support in Donbas compared to other regions of Ukraine . Other regions are not likely to follow Donbas and separate from Ukraine .
