 development of these weapons was completed three months after victory in Europe . They were immediately used against Japan to shorten the Pacific War and prevent the large numbers of casualties anticipated .
 U.S. viewed as instruments of warfighting in face of Soviet Union’s superior conventional might that threatened Western Europe .
After the Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test in 1949, an unconstrained bilateral arms race began . The arsenals of the United States and Soviet Union eventually rose to the dizzying height of some thirty thousand and forty thousand weapons, respectively .
 As arsenals grew, their purpose evolved to emphasize deterring war, rather than fighting war . Both sides became locked in a mutual assured deterrence relationship, and both sides became more likely to fight .
 It was clear that there were pressures to maintain an arsenal well beyond the needs of assuring a devastating retaliation . But it was also clear there were also pressures to keep an arsenal in place .
In any event, with the end of the Cold War and demise of the Soviet Union, the importance of nuclear weapons diminished greatly in the United States .
 Russia faced grave economic difficulties in maintaining its huge nuclear arsenal . Russia depended even more on nuclear weapons as its conventional capabilities atrophied .
 The arsenals of both the U.S. and Russia were significantly reduced . As a result, the arsenals in both the United States and Russia are significantly reduced.
 The war on terrorism took center stage in the U.S. 10 years later, all things nuclear became secondary considerations in national security strategy .
National security is once again focusing on peer and near-peer competitors and nuclear weapons . The Cold War era is now in its fourth decade of the post-Cold War era .
Current circumstances and the Cold War differ in many dimensions . While perceptions of nuclear threats are rising, current circumstances and Cold War are different .
 It is timely to review the necessary and proper roles of nuclear weapons as we look ahead over the coming decades . So rather than simply reverting to Cold War thinking, it is time to review nuclear weapons .
 The role in deterring nuclear strikes by other nuclear states is well-plowed ground . There remain serious differences regarding the arsenal size and composition of nuclear weapons .
What is far less understood is the role of nuclear weapons in crisis initiation, progression, and outcome . By contrast, what is far more understood is how nuclear weapons are used in crises .
 Our research program is designed to fill this important intellectual gap by challenging the continued relevance of Cold War thinking in several critical dimensions .
In particular, we question continued applicability of quantitative research based on Cold War crises . We question the correlation of superiority in the nuclear balance with favorable crisis outcomes .
 The side with the larger nuclear arsenal is more likely to achieve its objectives in a crisis, says Matthew Kroenig . We have been partially motivated by the work of Matthew Kroanig, who in an important analysis of Cold War nuclear crises .
 We are unconvinced that his findings apply to the current era . However, we are unconvincced that he's findings apply.
 In addition, there is great uncertainty in estimates of the probability of “winning a crisis’s a crisis. In addition to that, there's great uncertainty about the probability.
 In our first publication under this research program, we demonstrate methods for appropriately quantifying such uncertainty and presenting it in a manner accessible to policy makers .
 Further statistical analyses are planned for post-Cold War nuclear crises . These are arguably better indicators of the roles of nuclear weapons now and in the future .
 statistical analyses will have large uncertainties in results. We recognize that because there have been only a handful of these crises, we recognize that there are only a few .
 Our perspective is that this is not a reason to abandon such analyses. However, our perspective is not to abandon these analyses, we say .
 Large uncertainties reflect the reality of our limited understanding of nuclear crises, says author . "Large uncertainties" reflect reality of nuclear crisis, he says .
To complement our statistical analyses, we are conducting case studies of post-Cold War nuclear crises . To complement our analysis, we're conducting cases of post–Cold War crises .
 Case studies can establish causal linkages between nuclear weapons and crisis outcomes . In contrast to historical statistical analyses, case studies provide a richness of context .
 This paper addresses the role of nuclear weapons in the Crimean crisis . It represents our first such study, it says .
 nuclear weapons do not directly figure into much of this chronology . It provides the necessary foundation for understanding the crisis and the episodes in which nuclear weapons did play a clear role .
 The appendix focuses on coding variables that are often invoked in the academic literature to describe crises . It is intended to support future statistical analyses .
 Other planned case studies will address the crisis involving the North Korean nuclear weapons program, the Doklam Plateau crisis and the series of India–Pakistan crises over Kashmir .
 We are concerned that brinkmanship has been unreasonably dominant in attempts to explain the broad variety of behaviors exhibited in nuclear crisis . We are also concerned that the nuclear crisis has been uncharacteristic .
 We will assess the ability and limitations of this theory to contribute to our understanding of post-Cold War nuclear crises . We will also investigate alternative theories that might better explain behaviors and outcomes in nuclear crises.
 We will try to answer the question of whether it makes sense to try to develop an overarching theory of behavior in nuclear crises or to develop a set of complementary theories .
 A more complete understanding of the roles of nuclear weapons will lead to wiser decisions, says U.S. nuclear expert . "More complete understanding" of the role of the nuclear weapons is needed, he says .
 Despite explicit nuclear posturing, the episode in Crimea is often overlooked as a nuclear crisis . Instead, it is instead considered a crisis between Russia and Ukraine .
 The invasion of Crimea points to notable implications for the nuclear balance, resolve, and crisis management . Russia and the U.S. are involved in a confrontation over Crimea .
 Ukraine’s removal of Yanukovych from office saw Russia take immediate military action to invade and occupy the Crimean Peninsula . Russia took immediate action to take control of the peninsula .
 The United States sought to maintain Ukraine’s territorial integrity . In response, the U.S. sought to keep Ukraine's territorial integrity.
 The crisis held a grave importance for Russia, which viewed it less as a fight against Ukraine and more as a confrontation with the West over ground that held military, national, cultural, and symbolic significance .
 Russia’s military gains on the ground were maintained throughout the crisis under its threats to use nuclear weapons or deploy nuclear weapons .
Despite public disagreement among U.S. policy and military leaders, the United States' responses remained diplomatic and economic . The United States’ responses remain diplomatic, economic .
 Nuclear weapons played a recurring role in the progression and outcome of the crisis in Crimea . The crisis has been dubbed the Crimea crisis.
 Ukraine’s disarmament in exchange for national security guarantees in the 1990s meant that even if nuclear weapons were never invoked during the crisis itself, the crisis would carry implications for future disarmament and nonproliferation efforts .
 Vladimir Putin claimed to have considered a nuclear alert at the outset of the crisis . Russia televised a thinly veiled nuclear threat against the U.S.
 Russia's military actions and maneuvers before the referendum sought to deter intervention against the invasion of Crimea . Russia’s military action and maneuvers were in place before the vote .
 Russia escalated military actions on the peninsula and leveraged nuclear threats to solidify the new status quo on the ground . After the referendum, Russia escalated its military actions.
 Threats and posturing continued into 2015, parallel to another crisis in Donbass . These threats and postures continued into2015, parallel with another crisis.
 The United States was the primary target of Russian nuclear posturing during this period . The U.S. was the main target of Russia's posturing .
 Russia did not accept US nonintervention as a given and took steps to deter intervention through both public and private channels . It is not clear that the United States would have sought to intervene if Russia had not drawn nuclear red lines .
 The nonstrategic element of the Russian arsenal carried a special significance due to Russia’s standing military doctrine at the time . The development of Russian strategies inflating the role ofNonstrategic nuclear weapons in otherwise conventional confrontations .
 The dual-use nature of Russia’s weapons associated with the nonstrategic nuclear arsenal played an exacerbating role in nuclear posturing during the crisis .
Vagueness around the presence of nuclear arms escalated tensions . Combined with direct threats to use nuclear force against any attempt to return Crimea to Ukraine .
 Russia’s standing doctrine allowing for nuclear first use was an important contribution to the plausibility of Russian threats . Russia's standing doctrine allowed for nuclearfirst use was a significant contribution to Russian threats.
 In-depth case analysis of Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the ensuing crisis demonstrates how several variables played instrumental roles in the progression and outcome . The case analysis shows how several factors played instrumental role in the outcome .
 The U.S. had overall nuclear superiority, but this did not translate into greater resolve or victory .
 The deterrent potential of this nonstrategic nuclear superiority was buttressed by a military doctrine for first use in response to conventional force . The military doctrine was leveraged during the crisis through nuclear threats, allusions and the movement of dual-use weapons on the Crimean Peninsula .
Academic community should consider nonstrategic nuclear balance and perceived plausibility of first-use threats in future studies of nuclear crises .
 The crisis in Crimea suggests Russia will be willing to brandish its nonstrategic nuclear weapons in combination with its first-use policy to deter the U.S. in future crises .
 Crimea might not have been viewed as a vital national interest to the U.S. If Crimea were this a NATO nation, that would likely have been different .
 Russia's nonstrategic nuclear arsenal is leveraged to threaten and intimidate the United States and its allies . Future strategy development, war games, and national security exercises should account for Russia’s nuclear arsenal .
 The U.S. needs a strategic approach to deter Russian revisionist actions in the future . That approach needs to account for the threat of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, says the author .
 The Russian Federation responded to strategic asymmetry and the importance of “access the culminating Euromaidan movement in Ukraine to proportionate rungs on the escalatory ladder” by invading, occupying and annexing Crimea .

 In Crimea, the U.S. did not risks than their nuclear inferior counterparts, Kroenig says .
 The U.S. did not intend to intervene militarily, says Kroenig . The United States has been involved in the crisis in Crimea for years .
 Russia possessed the crisis did not consider nuclear red lines drawn greater proximity and higher political stakes in the by Russia to be viable threats .
 Russia did not take U.S. nonintervention as a given, and the gravity of the crisis was far greater for Russia as well . All of which contributed to Russia’s the United States.
 Russia did not possess nuclear responses would likely be more urgent and the superiority over the U.S. But Russia didn't have any nuclear responses, it's not likely to be urgent .
 Russia did, however, possess a significantly larger nonstraplausible Russian response to U.S. conventional nuclear arsenal, as well as a standing doctrine force .
 The first use of nuclear weapons in response to and national security exercises should account for conventional force . Russia’s nonstrategic nuclear arsenal is played an outsized and repeated role in the crisis .
 The U.S. needs to account state with nonstrategic nuclear superiority, higher for the threat of nuclear weapons, says Peter Bergen . Bergen: The proximity and conventional capability to seize the initiative to invade.
 Academic community should consider the nonstrategic nuclear balance and the perceived plausibility of first-use threats in addition to overall arsenal balance .
 The outcome is coded as a win for the Russian Federation, which achieved its objective of ensuring control over the peninsula . The U.S. failed to achieve the objective of preserving the territorial integrity of Ukraine .
 Control variables are detailed below as appropriate, including extensive discussion of the Nuclear Ratio and Superiority variables .
 The nature of the available data on the nuclear balance between Russia and the United States creates a certain level of ambiguity around which actor truly held nuclear superiority during the invasion of Crimea .
 When using the data for an analysis of the nuclear crisis, several assumptions are necessary to code the values for the Nuclear Ratio and Superiority variables .
 When the assumptions are accepted as valid, one is able to code the Superiority variable as tipping slightly in the favor of the United States over the Russian Federation, with a Nuclear Ratio of 0.52 and 0.47, respectively .
 The number of arms allows for the possibility that the Russian Federation had nuclear superiority in 2014 . However, there are apparent discrepancies in how nuclear armaments have been counted through the years .
 The 2014 worldwide deployments report shows a Russian superiority with 8,000 warheads . “approximately 4,300 of the Russian warheads are operational or in military custody,’s report says .
 The Russian Invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, 2014–2015, was the first Russian invasion of the Crimea Peninsula . In later years, the nuclear balance was portrayed differently in this data .
 The total inventory, on the other hand, “counts warheads in the military stockpile as well as retired, but still intact, warheads awaiting dismantlement,’164 implies that this category of warhead should be excluded from arsenal counts .
 The NRDC data only covers 1945-2002 . It appears to be consistent with later approaches that exclude certain categories of warheads .
 NRDC data appears not only to exclude such warheads from much of its data, but also to treat such data inconsistently between the United States and Soviet Union/Russian Federation .
 ‘nuclear arsenal size’ as assessed by Kroenig is more consistent with the worldwide deployments report definition of Military Stockpile than Total Inventory . Retired warheads awaiting dismantlement are excluded from the list .
 It suggests that warheads “in reserve status’ are not treated consistently across the historical data . Second, it suggests that the data doesn’t show that warheads in reserve status are treated consistently .
 If retired warheads are counted in state arsenals for 2014, then the Russian Federation has nuclear superiority . The Russian Federation will have nuclear superiority.
 If retired warheads are not counted, then the U.S. has superiority . The United States has superiority, according to experts .
