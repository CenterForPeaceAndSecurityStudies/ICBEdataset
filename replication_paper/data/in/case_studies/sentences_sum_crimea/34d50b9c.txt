 The Atlantic Council responded to this challenge in February 2014 by launching the Ukraine in Europe Initiative . The initiative is aimed at enhancing Ukraine’s security, advancing Ukraine's reform process and economic prospects .
 The Council's Initiative also aims to counter Moscow’s massive disinformation campaign .
 If the international community cannot distinguish fact from fiction, it is unlikely to coalesce around an effective strategy to support Ukraine and deter Mr Putin .
 Putin's War in Ukraine is the Council’s contribution to offer clarity on the conflict .
 The conflict in Ukraine’s east is a Kremlinmanufactured war, fueled by Russian-made military equipment, and supported by Mr Putin .

 As Ukrainians struggled to build a new government, mysterious “little green men’s’ began to appear . The mysterious ‘little greenmen’ appeared in Crimea and in eastern Ukraine .
Russian military uniforms, Russian regional accents, and Russian-made weapons gave them away at first glance . To local residents and independent observers, the origins of the ‘little green men’ were far from mysterious .
 Crimea, now formally part of the Russian Federation, was lost to the “little green men’s from day one . Crimea is now officially part of Russia's Russian Federation .

 The downing of MH17 compelled Western media and governments to take a serious look at Russia’s military involvement in starting and fomenting the war in eastern Ukraine .
 In response to the MH17 tragedy, the transatlantic community imposed strong economic sanctions on Russia .
 Russian sanctions have taken a considerable toll on the Russian economy . But they have not deterred Russia from continuing to supply troops and weapons to Ukraine .
 The supply of more and more sophisticated weapons did not impede Ukraine’s counteroffensive operations through July and into August . Ukraine's counteroffensive operation through July, into August.
 Neither did the firing of sophisticated artillery from Russian territory into Ukraine stop Kyiv’s advance into Ukraine .
 Kyiv was on the verge of encircling Moscow’s ever smaller enclaves in Donetsk and Luhansk . By mid-August, Kyiv had been on the brink of encircling Moscow's ever larger enclaves .
 Russian army soundly defeated Ukrainian forces and forced a retreat in a couple of weeks .

 Russian forces in Ukraine have received cover from shelling from Russian territory .
 Russian government denials, with satellite data, crater analysis, and open source materials, one can establish that many of these attacks originated in Russia and not in the separatist controlled areas of Ukraine .
 Satellite imagery from August 8, 2014, showed the crater field near the Dolzhanskaya-Capital mine outside of the Panchenkove village .
 The trajectories calculated based on the shape of the craters revealed that there were six separate attacks from five different directions .
 The attack occurred on July 16, 2014 in the vicinity of Gukovo, Russia .
 Four videos containing geotags filmed in and around Gukovo showed the launch of rockets . Two of these videos showed burning after the rockets were launched .
 All of the calculated trajectories can be traced to five separate firing positions, with maximum differences of three hundred meters at a shelling distance of fifteen kilometers . All the trajectories are calculated to five different firing positions .
 Every one of these positions near Chervonopartyzansk, Ukraine, is within the territory of Russia .
 A Russian journalist visited Gukovo and spoke to the locals after the attacks .
 Cross-border attacks served as cover for the renewed military incursion in the summer of 2014 .
 Attacks originating in border towns like Gukovo allowed Russian forces operating inside Ukraine to reverse the tide of the conflict .

 The Russian military began rapidly constructing massive training camps only a few kilometers from the Ukrainian border in 2014 .
Hundreds of photographs from soldiers’ social media profiles. This fact is supported by satellite imagery comparisons and by hundreds of photographs .
 The evidence confirms the existence and development of such camps and shows that they serve as launching pads for Russia’s war against Ukraine .
 Two camps, near the Russian border towns of Kuybyshevo and Pavlovka, staged artillery attacks from Russian to Ukrainian territory . A third near the town of Kuzminka housed hundreds of Russian soldiers before they fought in key battles in Ukraine .
 This camp was established only forty-six kilometers from the Ukrainian border and did not exist before 2014 . This camp is only 40-six km from the Ukraine border .
 The 5th Tank Brigade from Ulan-Ude, Siberia, was deployed to the site in October and November of 2014 . The site has become the site for hundreds of military vehicles .
