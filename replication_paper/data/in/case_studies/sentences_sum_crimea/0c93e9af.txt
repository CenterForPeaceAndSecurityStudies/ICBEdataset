 Lugansk People's Republic examines Russian intentions by means of an analysis both of of ofﬁcial rhetoric and of Russia’s actions in Donbass .
 Moscow has largely been reacting to events and trying to gain some control of a process which was originally almost entirely outside of its control . It concludes that far from instigating the rebellion in Donbass and using it to destabilise Ukraine, it is not using it as a destabilising tool .
 The Ukrainian government is trying to negotiate directly with the rebels in order to produce a permanent peace settlement based on some form of special status for Donbass within Ukraine . Its primary aim is to get the Ukrainian government to negotiate direct with rebels .
 It has also used its inﬂuence over the rebels in order to persuade them to cooperate with the peace process set up at Minsk .
 Russia’s objectives are very limited, and do not pose a serious threat to European security as a whole . Russia's objective is to protect its citizens and its citizens .
 The war in Ukraine has led to an outpouring of literature analysing the intentions of Russia and its president Vladimir Putin .
 This article examines what those intentions may be and their implications for European security by surveying Russia’s actions in the war in Donbass .
 The article analyses Russian decision-making processes . It looks at ofﬁcial discourse and actual Russian deeds .
 Russia has largely been reacting to events and pursuing limited goals which do not threaten wider European security . It concludes that rather than deliberately inciting rebellion in Donbass, Russia has been using it to destabilise Ukraine as part of an effort to reshape the international order .
 Views on what Russia wants in Ukraine vary considerably . Russia's objectives in Ukraine are not clear .
 At the most alarmist end of the spectrum are analyses which conclude that Russia wants to completely revise the existing international system . At the time, Russia is considered to be one of the world's most dangerous countries .
 Rovner says Putin 'might be willing to try the same gambit in the Baltics on the pretext of defending ethnic Russians'
Russian objectives are limited to territorial expansion, says some . Less extreme thinkers view Russian objectives as being limited to territories .
 One of his key goals is the creation of a land bridge from Russia to Crimea . The land bridge is one of his main goals .
Long term goal may be the creation of 'Novorossiya' or New Russia, which would constitute all of southern Ukraine past Odessa to Moldova .
 'Transdniestrianisation' in which rebel regions of Donbass become de facto independent . This same objective could also be achieved by pursuing so-called ‘Transdnestrianisation,’ in other words .
 Sakwa denies that Russia is a ‘revisionist’ state . On the more pro-Russia end of the spectrum, Sakwa says Russia is not a 'revisionists' state .
 Russian analysts overwhelmingly reject the idea that Moscow wants to acquire additional territory in Ukraine .
 Russian nationalists believe Moscow's support for autonomy represents a face-saving way for the Kremlin to sell an impending betrayal of the Donbass rebels to the Russian people . Most Western observers believe that the call for autonomy hides a desire to extend Russian inﬂuence into Ukraine .
 Moscow has always opposed the uprising in Donbass. According to this viewpoint, Moscow hasalways opposed the revolt .
 Russia's objective is to establish a new order in Ukraine which can sustain long-term peace . They assess that Russia’s objective is. to establish an new order.
 Fundamental mutual economic dependency makes Russia interested in Ukraine’s stability . Russia also wants Ukraine's stability .
 Determining Russian intentions is made difﬁcult by the fact that the Kremlin’s decisionmaking processes are opaque .
 At another level a second para-political world exists based on informal groups, factions, and operating within the framework of the inner court of the presidency .
 There is a tendency to view the Russian state as highly centralised, with all authority resting in President Putin's hands .
 This implies that there is a single will behind Russia’s actions in Ukraine . This implies there is not a singlewill behind Russia's actions.
 Sakwa raises another possibility – that there are multiple competing wills, with policy emerging from the interaction of the various factions . Sakwa: "There are multiple factions. There are multiple different wills"
 'Russia’s system of power has not been a strict power vertical ruled only by one person,' Jensen says .
Public opinion does serve to restrict policy options and can on occasion force the Kremlin’s hand . Also important is public opinion which, while not a decisive factor in policy making, is important .
 The doves consider Russia’s most important interest to be a restoration of economic growth, which requires good relations with the West and the removal of sanctions . Russia's most important interests are to restore economic growth.
 They are willing to make considerable concessions in order to bring the war in Donbass to an end . They are prepared to make some concessions to end the conflict in the region .
 Ukraine and its Western allies are bent on confrontation with Russia and will not accept any compromise . The hawks, by contrast, believe that making concessions is pointless, because Ukraine and the West won't accept concessions .
 Kremlin strategy has been more consistent than last statement suggests, but it has been a middle-of-the-road, compromise strategy . It has been designed to satisfy both hawks and doves, rather than a maximalist strategy .
 The consistency of Moscow’s intentions can be seen in ofﬁcial statements by senior members of the Russian government . President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
 The Russian position has been that Donbass is part of Ukraine, but that political stability can only return to Ukraine if the people of Donbass feel secure .
 Putin remarked that they are citizens of Ukraine, but they should be citizens with equal rights in their country, that’s the entire issue . Thus in April 2014, Putin said they are citizen of Ukraine .
 Putin unsuccessfully urged rebels to cancel referendums they had planned for 11 May 2014 . In order to encourage such a dialogue, Putin unsuccessfully tried to encourage the rebels to postpone the vote .
 Lavrov denied that Russia was seeking to annex all of Ukraine . His mention of the concept of ‘Novorossiya’ in April 2014 gave rise to speculation .
 Poroshenko announced his support for the ceaseﬁre called by Poroshenko on 20 June . He said it is important to open the way to a dialogue between all of the parties to the combat .
 In September 2015, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mariya Zakharova reiterated this, saying ‘Russia, like the whole world, sees no alternative to the Minsk agreements.
 Putin said the most important thing is to establish direct contact between the authorities in Kiev and Donetsk and Lugansk republics .
 There needs to be constitutional reform to ensure the autonomous rights of the unrecognised republics . This should be done, as the Minsk Agreements read, in coordination with Donetsk People's Republic and Lugansk People’s Republic .
 Putin supported the fulﬁlment of the Minsk agreements and noted the importance of constitutional reform in Ukraine . He underlined that it was important to agree this with Donetsk and Lugansk .
 Putin again mentioned the need for direct dialogue between Kiev and the self-proclaimed republics .
 Russia's primary objective is to get Kiev to talk to its opponents in Donbass . If all this rhetoric is to be believed, then Russia’s primary objective has to be to talk with Kiev .
 The extent to which of the Russian rhetoric reﬂects genuine motivations is, of course, disputable . But the consistency of the statements does mean that they need to be taken seriously .
 Some commentators claimed the rebellion was organised by members of the Russian Army and secret services . The uprising in Donbass began in spring 2014 .
 Western journalists of seizures of government buildings show a very different story, as do accounts by Western observers .
 A vast plethora of militias appeared, as separate leaders established power over their own zones of operations .
 The result was a chaotic situation over which nobody, let alone the Russian government, had any control .
 52 Russians under the command of Igor Strelkov helped to seize buildings in the towns of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk .
 Strelkov himself claims that he came to Ukraine in response to an appeal from Donbass activists . Despite allegations that he was acting on behalf of the Russian intelligence services, he says he was not acting for them .
 Petro Poroshenko declared a ceaseﬁre in June 2014 . Moscow persuaded the then head of the DPR, Aleksandr Borodai, to abide by the peace talks . He refused to participate in the promised peace talks.
 No worthwhile evidence has ever been produced showing that units of the Russian Army were in Donbass in the early stages of the conﬂict .
 The overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens have always been Ukrainian citizens . The majority of the rebels are Ukrainian citizens.
 Most of the self-defence forces are from Donbass and the surrounding area, says Mark Franchetti of The Sunday Times .
Little evidence has been provided to support these allegations . However, little evidence has not been provided .
 Various private organisations recruited the majority of the volunteers . Those involved tell a different story to that provided by Nemtsov report .
 In fact, some volunteers hold extremist political views which are sharply at variance with those of the Kremlin .
 Strelkov is a monarchist who associated with radical nationalists such as Igor Ivanov . He is the head of the Russian General Military Union . He has been appointed chief of the DPR Army's Political Department .
 The presence of people like Strelkov and Ivanov in high positions in the rebel leadership was indicative of the lack of control Moscow had over the rebellion in the past few months .
Evidence suggests rebel militias supplied themselves almost entirely by capturing weapons and ammunition from the Ukrainian army and security services .
 Strelkov regularly complained that he was not receiving support from Russia . While commanding the rebels at Slavyansk, he regularly complained about Russia .
 Jenzen-Jones carried out a thorough analysis of the weapons used by the rebels and their likely origins for the organisation Armament Research Services .
 There remains no direct evidence of Russian government complicity in the trafﬁcking of arms into the area . Despite the presence of arms, munitions, and armoured vehicles designed, produced, and allegedly even sourced from Russia, there remains no evidence .
 The majority of arms and munitions documented in service with separatist forces have evidently been appropriated from the Ukrainian security forces and their installations within Ukraine .
 All of the above suggests that the initial uprising took place largely without Moscow’s encouragement or support .
 Russia began to play a more direct role in the conﬂict. From mid-July 2014, the situation changed and Russia started to play more direct roles .
Russian artillery occasionally ﬁred over the border at Ukrainian units south of Donetsk and Lugansk . It seems likely that from around mid-July 2014, Russian artillery occasionally occurred in Ukraine .
 Photographs of an artillery strike on a Ukrainian Army unit at Zelenopole on 11 July 2014 .
 Even if many of the rebels’ weapons were taken from the Ukrainians, they were using far more ammunition than they could possibly have captured .
The only plausible explanation is that the ammunition came from Russia . The only plausible reason is that it was from Russia.
 In July and August 2014, the Ukrainian Army advanced closer to Donetsk and Lugansk . The Ukrainian Army is advancing closer to Lugansk.
 The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine deteriorated substantially. As it did so, it repeatedly shelled those cities, and the humanitarian situation deteriorated substantially .
 In early/mid-August the Kremlin made a decision to try to bring the war to an end. In this context, it would appear that in early/ mid-August, the Kremlin would appear to have made the decision .
 No peace settlement would work if the rebels did not agree to it, and if the rebel leaders were not able to get their subordinates to abide by the terms of the settlement . If the rebels do not agree, no peace settlement will work if they do not.
 Russia had to persuade the Ukrainian government to end its military operations . Then, as a second step, it had to convince the Ukraine government to stop its military operation .
This required inﬂicting a serious military defeat on the Ukrainian Army. This required in in�cticting a serious military loss on the Ukraine Army .
 The political leaders of the DPR and LPR, Aleksandr Borodai and Valerii Bolotov, resigned . First, after visits to Russia, they visited the Russian capital, the city of Moscow .
Strelkov resigned too, obviously unwillingly and under considerable duress . Next, Strelkov quit too.
 Russia became directly involved in military operations in Donbass . With a new rebel leadership in place, Russia now becomes directly involved .
 Russian soldiers began posting messages on social media saying that they were in Ukraine . From mid-August 2014, Russian soldiers started posting messages about Ukraine .
 The Russians succeeded in inﬂicting a serious defeat on the Ukrainian Army around the town of Ilovaisk, allowing the rebels to recapture a signiﬁcant amount of lost territory . On 5 September 2014, a cease�
 The rebel leaders did not want to sign the Minsk agreement, it would appear . It would appear that they did so only because Moscow insisted .
 Russia's behaviour at this point makes no sense. If Russia’s intent had been to destabilise Ukraine, seize additional Ukrainian territory or reshape the international order in some fundamental way, it doesn't make sense .
 Moscow would have let the rebels keep on going. If any of those had been the objectives, Moscow would've let them keep going .
 The only explanation for the Russians’ actions is that their objectives were very different . Ukrainian government agreed to speak to the rebels and provided Donbass with some degree of autonomy .
 The September 2014 Minsk agreement temporarily reduced the scale of violence in Ukraine . But neither side was really committed to making it work .
 As a result, ﬁghting continued and eventually escalated into major battles around Donetsk airport and the town of Debaltsevo .
 At this point, Russia appears to have increased the scale of the voentorg . Russia has also increased the size of the Russian voentor .
 As the front lines were more or less static until late January 2015, the rebels cannot have captured this amount of ammunition .
In late 2014 and early 2015, foreign observers spotted a number of items of military equipment in rebel-held territory . They were not believed to have ever been in the inventory of the Ukrainian Army .
 Russian soldiers’ involvement at this stage of the war was probably limited mostly to reconnaissance, intelligence, and communications, rather than direct combat .
 Moscow encouraging process of state formation in DPR and LPR in order to rein in the local warlords who exercised too much independent power .
 Other rebel leaders followed Strelkov’s lead and resigned, most notably the commander of the Gorlovka garrison, Igor Bezler and Nikolai Kozitsyn .
 It is not clear how these men were persuaded to quit, but it seems likely that some form of Russian pressure was involved .
 New LPR and DPR authorities gained more control over the disparate rebel forces . The new LPR authorities gain more control of the rebel forces.
Negotiations took place in Minsk in early 2015 on a new peace settlement . This proved useful when negotiations took place. This is the first time talks have taken place in the city of Minsk .
 Kiev to negotiate with rebels and offer some form of autonomy, these clauses satisﬁed Russian desires .
Rebel leaders Zakharchenko and Plotnitskii were not happy with each other .
 Their forces were advancing, and they wished to continue their military offensive . Their forces wanted to continue the offensive .
 According to one story, having been summoned to Minsk to do so, they refused . According to another story, they had been summoned by Minsk.
 Putin sent Surkov to see them to persuade them to change their minds . Putin then sent him to see him to persuade him to change his mind .
 Russia used its growing inﬂuence over the DPR and LPR not to encourage further military offensives, but rather the opposite . It is clear from this that Russia used it growing in ﬁuence to avoid further militaryOffensives .
 March 2015–present The Minsk-2 agreement did not bring immediate peace . March 2015-present The Russian-Ukrainian agreement was signed in March 2015 . The agreement was reached in March 2014 .
 Fighting continued throughout the spring and summer of 2015, albeit at a much reduced level . Fighting continued through the summer and spring of 2015 .
 It seems likely that of the Russian Army took over many of the senior positions in the rebel armies .
Almost all the previously independent rebel units had been incorporated into the two corps . By autumn 2015, almost all the previous rebel units were incorporated in the two Corps .
 The government has not provided any proof of this allegation, but it is credible . It is not clear whether the government has provided any evidence .
 Russian military analysts refer to the corps system as a means by which Russia has expanded its control over the rebels . hints have emerged that Russian ofﬁcers play an important role within the corps .
 Crimean blogger Boris Rozhin has proven to be very well informed on events within the rebel republics . He refers to ‘curators’ accompanying the rebel forces .
 Fighting is low intensity, at the most remote parts of the front, says Rozhin . There are no European observers, staff ofﬁcers and Russian ‘curators’
 If Rozhin is correct, this reveals that the ‘curators’ have used their inﬂuence to make the rebels abide by the ceaseﬁre . The 'curators' have been using their in in in�
 Russian claims that Moscow wants the February 2015 Minsk agreement to work . A number of other events conﬁrmed Russian claims have also been made .
 In 2014, pro-rebel Ukrainian politicians had established a ‘Novorossiya parliament,’ consisting of representatives from across the south and east of Ukraine . The objective of creating an autonomous 'NovorOSSiya' throughout that part of the country.
 The decision was Tsarev's, it seems probable that he would not have felt it necessary to end the Novorossiya project .
 The freeze strongly suggests that Russia is not interested in creating a so-called ‘land bridge’ across southern Ukraine to Crimea . Instead, Russia prefers to work within the framework agreed at Minsk .
 This was demonstrated again in October 2015, when the so-called ‘Normandy Four’ met for talks in Paris .
 Kiev has consistently refused to negotiate directly with the rebels . Kiev, however, has repeatedly refused to talk directly with rebels .
 The required ‘dialogue’ with ‘representatives of particular districts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts’ failed to take place in summer and autumn 2015 .
 rebels announced they would hold local elections under their own laws . In light of this, the rebels announced that they would be holding local elections in the future .
 Vladimir Putin agreed to use his inﬂuence over the rebels to persuade them to cancel these elections . In Paris, Vladimir Putin used his in inﬁuence to persuade rebels to cancel the elections .
 Kiev had passed a law giving the rebels amnesty and had negotiated with them ‘special status’ for Donbass . At the Paris meeting, it was agreed that the elections would take place only after the law was passed .
 The Germans and French supported Russia in putting the onus on Ukraine to make concessions to the rebels . The German and French support Russia in making concessions to Ukraine .
 Moscow’s consistent position since the start of the crisis, and it remains true at the time of writing in late 2015 . This has been Moscow's consistent position for the past year .
 Russia was at ﬁrst largely reacting to events, and its actions have been directed towards gaining inﬂuence over a process which was initially entirely outside of its control .
 Moscow does not want to annex Donbass, let alone create a ‘land bridge’ to Crimea .
Nor is it seeking to overturn the existing international security system. Nor is it trying to overturn it .
 Russia’s pursuit of such autonomy reﬂects a belief that a stable order can only be restored in Ukraine if the interests of those who opposed the Maidan revolution are taken into account .
 Russian actions in Donbass do not pose a serious threat to broader European security. What this means is that Russian actions are not serious threats to European security, says CNN .
 The evidence above does not justify claims that Russia will seek to destabilise other countries . If not stopped in Donbass, Russia will try to capture territory there .
 Kiev will grant meaningful ‘special status’ to Donbass if Russia does not talk to its opponents . It is not clear what Russia will do if Kiev does not fulﬁl the promises it made at Minsk and Paris .
 Moscow's policy to date has rested on an assumption that Kiev can be forced to make major concessions, not just on paper, but in reality . Moscow’s policy todate has been based on a belief that Kiev must make concessions .
 Ukrainian government may be forced to accept some form of Transdniestrianisation . If the Ukrainian government continues to refuse to concede what Moscow wants, the Kremlin may reconsider its policy and to accept Transdnestrianisation.
 This would represent an acceptance of reality, rather than the intended outcome of deliberate policy . This would be the first time a government policy has been implemented . This, however, would represent a reality rather than a deliberate policy.
