 Belarusian leader Stanislav Shushkevich had invited Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to Belavezha . The two leaders agreed on a structure to govern relations among the republics in their newfound independence .
 The role of Ukraine, second in importance only to Russia among the Soviet republics, was key in determining the viability of the union . Ukraine was a key part of the Soviet Union .

 The Soviet Union no longer existed, and parliament would not allow him to create new unions of any kind . It would not be allowed to create any kind of union .
 The need to preserve economic cooperation among the republics compelled Kravchuk to consider a new supranational structure . The need for economic cooperation in the country compelled the need for a new structure .
 Yeltsin did not insist on maintaining a union, because he both sought independence for Russia . He recognised that a union that excluded Ukraine would be meaningless .
 The Soviet Union 'is ceasing to exist as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality' The agreement created the Commonwealth of Independent States .
 All three countries’ shared interest in breaking away from the Soviet Union’s centre overrode their disagreements about the terms of the divorce .

 Belarusian president invited Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to a similar gathering in Minsk in August 2014 . Nearly 23 years later, Belarusian President Vladimir Putin invited his Russian and Ukraine counterparts to the same gathering .
 Kazakhstan and the EU were also represented at the meeting . Both the issue – the nature of the relationship between Russia and its neighbours, particularly Ukraine – was essentially the same .
 Minsk gathering produced no agreements of any consequence. Unlike the summit at Belavezha, however, no agreements were made .
 The situation in the country has been steadily deteriorating, and international tensions progressively escalating . The situation is steadily deteriorating.
 This steady downward trend has been punctuated by a series of false denouements . This steady decline has been marked by a number of false Denouements.
 The media and some Western policymakers have seized on these events as signs of a definitive turning point in the crisis .

 An analysis of the fundamental drivers of the conflict suggests that we are moving further away from a genuine resolution . But an analysis suggests that the conflict is moving further from a real resolution .
 Ukraine crisis will continue until root causes are addressed, if not fully addressed . We can expect the Ukraine crisis to continue until the root causes of the crisis are addressed .

 The Yanukovich government drew 75% of its ministerial-level leadership from the south and east of the country . 42% from Donetsk, Yanukovich’s home province, the country's home province .
 The south and east are home to nearly 50% of the country’s total population . The government was equally regionally unbalanced, according to the government .
 New appointments in the interim have slightly righted the balance in Kiev . But the war in Donetsk and Luhansk broke the scales .
 Donbas accounts for 15% of Ukraine’s population, 16% of its GDP, 25% of industrial output and 27% of the total exports . Donbas is the country's most populous region, with a population of 15% .
 The population there was hostile to the post-Maidan government even before the shelling of the regional capitals began .
 The promise of greater regional autonomy might have reduced this hostility and transformed Ukraine’s diversity from a weakness into a strength, remains unfulfilled .

 Kiev and the rest of the country. Just as attitudes have hardened in the conflict zone, so too have those in Kiev and elsewhere .
 paramilitary groups will be a potent radicalising political force once they return from the front-lines . One of which openly embraces Nazi symbolism, another is led by a violent convict .
 Efforts to create a new party to fill the void have only just gotten off the ground .
 It remains unclear how Donbas will vote in the current security environment, particularly given the exodus of thousands of its residents to Russia and other parts of Ukraine .
 Ukrainian domestic politics is more divisive and polarised than ever. In short, Ukrainian domestic Politics is more polarised and divisive than ever .

 Russia invaded Crimea following the late-February change of power in Crimea . The crisis became international when Russia invaded the Crimea in February . The root cause was the failure of the post-Cold War European and Euro-Atlantic institutional architecture to achieve its stated aim of creating a Europe that was whole
 Russia has seen the eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO as an economic and security threat . Most of the country’s neighbours see membership of these organisations as the key to prosperity and security .
 It would not have invaded Crimea in February, nor would it have destabilised the east . It would have been more than a month later .
 Ukraine would not have sought guarantees that Ukraine would stay out of the Alliance, nor would it have taken steps to undermine Ukraine’s EU Association Agreement .
Counterfactuals aside, Russia wants a say on matters that the U.S. and Europe consider to be none of its business .
 In the narrow sense, those matters include Ukraine’s geopolitical and geo-economic future, and its constitutional structure . In the narrower sense, these matters include the country's future and its constitution .
 The broader conflict between Russia and the West will not come to an end until some agreement is reached on the broader European-integration agenda . But even if compromise can be made, the broader conflict will not be made on those issues .
 Russia’s brazen actions in Ukraine, and the U.S. and EU sanctions in response, seem like a distant fantasy .

 For Western policymakers, it is Russia’s determination that ultimately makes this crisis so different to others in the post-Cold War period .
 Never before have they faced a major nuclear power as an adversary in a regional dispute .
 In Kosovo, Russia was an opponent, but Kosovo barely registered in the hierarchy of Russian national security imperatives .
 eastern Ukraine is one of a few places beyond Russia’s borders in which Moscow can deliver assets required to sustain an insurgency .
 Moscow took the decision to do everything it takes to avoid losing Ukraine several months ago . The decision was made by Moscow to keep Ukraine under control .
Without a negotiation process involving genuine give and take, Western sanctions will fail to change Russian behaviour . In other words, without a real negotiation process, the sanctions will not change Russia's behaviour .
 Talking to Moscow is a policy of necessity; it is not one that any Western leader would want to embrace publicly . It is not a policy that any West leader would like to embrace public .
 If Ukraine wants Ukraine to survive, they might not have a choice. If they want Ukraine to survival, they may not have an option .
 Its economy is already teetering on the brink of collapse, sustained only by a massive IMF loan . The IMF loan is the only way to keep the economy alive .
