 Reflexive control causes a stronger adversary to choose the actions most advantageous to Russian objectives by shaping the adversary’s perceptions of the situation decisively .
 Moscow has used this technique skillfully to persuade the United States and its European allies to remain largely passive in the face of Russia’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle Ukraine through military and non-military means .
 The West must become alert to the use of reflexive control techniques and find ways to counter them if it is to succeed in an era of hybrid war .
 Reflexive control, and the Kremlin’s information warfare generally, is not the result of any theoretical innovation . The Kremlin's information warfare is not a theoretical innovation.
 All of the underlying concepts and most of the techniques were developed by the Soviet Union decades ago . The Soviet Union developed many of the concepts and techniques that were developed in the USSR .
 Russian information operations in Ukraine do not herald a new era of theoretical or doctrinal advances, but they aim, in part, to create precisely this impression .
 Russia’s information warfare is thus a significant challenge to the West, but not a particularly novel or insuperable one .
 Russia relies on its ability to take advantage of pre-existing dispositions among its enemies to choose its preferred course of action . It relies, above all, on Russia’s ability to taking advantage of its pre- existing dispositions .
 Moscow has employed reflexive control techniques in Ukraine situation to persuade the West to do something its leaders mostly wanted to do in the first place . Russia has dismantled Ukraine as Russia dismantled Ukraine . Russia's main objective is to persuade West to take action in Ukraine .
 Western leaders are determined to stop Russian aggression and punish or reverse Russian violations of international law . These techniques would not have succeeded in the face of Western leaders .
 Russia has kept the West from intervening materially in Ukraine, allowing itself to build and expand its own military involvement in the conflict . The West has not intervened materially in the Ukraine conflict .
 It has sowed discord within the NATO alliance and created tensions between potential adversaries . It has also created tensions about how to respond .
 It has not changed popular or elite attitudes about Russia’s actions in Ukraine, nor has it created an information environment favorable to Moscow . It hasn’t fundamentally changed popular and elite attitudes.
 Russia has been unable to translate the strategic and grand strategic advantages of its hybrid warfare strategy into major successes on the ground in Ukraine .
 Moscow may be reaching a point of diminishing returns in continuing a strategy that relies in part on its unexpectedness in Ukraine . It appears that Moscow may also be reaching an end to its strategy in Ukraine.
 The same doctrine of reflexive control has succeeded in surprising the West in Syria . Yet the same doctrine has failed to surprise the West .
 The West must thus awaken itself to this strategy and to adaptations of it . The West has to adapt to the new strategy .
 Russian information war is not information warfare as the U.S. thinks about it, says the United States . Russia is not fighting information war, it is fighting information warfare .
 It is part of Russia’s method of conducting hybrid warfare, which consists of a deliberate disinformation campaign . It is supported by actions of the intelligence organs designed to confuse the enemy .
 The nature of hybrid operations makes it very difficult to detect or even determine ex post facto when they begin, since confusing enemy and neutral observers is one of its core components .
 Russia is actively using its information warfare techniques in support of a hybrid-warfare effort . Russia is trying to achieve its current objectives, namely the federalization of Ukraine or Kyiv’s concession of special legal status to the separatist-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine .
 Russia’s information warfare approach is designed to work from RELATIVE MILITARY WEAKNESS within the limitations of the 21st century strategic environment to HYBRID WAR and within Russia's budget constraints .
 Russian politics first appeared against adversaries with much greater aggregate economic and openly in February 2007 . It is essentially an approach born out of weakness that provides greater flexibility . It's essentially a approach born of weakness.
 Putin gave his famous Munich Speech. The novelty of this approach should not have been Putin's famous speech .
 Russia would no longer accept the U.S.-led, well-developed and documented Soviet techniques. In this speech, Putin be overestimated, however, as it is fundamentally based on older, older, based on old techniques .
 Russia would implement its own independent foreign policy in global environment . It appears unipolar model of international relations and that Russia different today partly because of new characteristics of the new characteristics .
 It makes use in particular of Washington’s pursuit of its geopolitical interests .
 Anatolyi Serdyukov became Russia’s Minister of Defense in the same month . He was tasked with fighting corruption and inefficiency in the armed forces .
 Serdyukov's appointment signaled a shift in Disinformation serves the obvious purpose of concealing Russia’s offensive strategy that would ultimately incorporate Russia's actual objectives .
 Russia allows Russia information operations, but military reforms did not take to deny that its forces are present in Ukraine . Operations are hidden under an active propaganda campaign, according to reports .
 Russia’s military and foreign reform of the Russian military only started in policy activities, thereby preserving the Kremlin's freedom of 2008, when Russia's performance in the war with Georgia action. It also creates diplomatic cover for Russia's military and Foreign Full-fledged reform.
 The disinformation campaign also makes it more difficult to find out what is needed for change .
 Russia's military evicting Georgia from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia's presence in the conflict zone . Despite Russia’s success in for military analysts to estimate the actual size of Russia‘s military evictioning Georgia.
 Active disinformation provides Russia with more flexibility in choosing methods to fight more technically advanced, Westernexacerbate the conflict in Ukraine .
 The Georgian war highlighted potential diplomatic solutions it can pursue . Many of the shortcomings of the Russian military were highlighted .
 Three out of the four Russian aircraft downed in the conflict this tactical dimension exceptionally well . By some estimates, Russian forces were responsible for the crashes of WWW .
 Russian commanddirector at the Russian Institute of Strategic Research . and-control structures lacked effective coordination .
 The Kremlin’s think tank is headed by a former Russian military officer . The Foreign Intelligence Service officer used Soviet-era mass-mobilization techniques .
 Russian forces consults with the Presidential Administration . One often lacked necessary training because of the military’s heavy of the most eloquent advocates of Ukrainian war .
 Russian forces used Soviet-era weaponry that against the West and even wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the frequently broke down mid-conflict . Technological deficiencies were also has written extensively on the use of information warfare apparent .
 West’s own information warfare tactics. Most of his publications elaborate on the challenges he faced in previous years .
 Bedritsky’s research the war itself provided the impetus for reform, which began in 2008.3 campaigns .
 Bedritsky's findings were far from innovative, as most of them paraphrase preexisting Soviet The Kremlin . The Kremlin examined its mistakes after the Georgian elaborations on information warfare .
 Russia's large-scale military operations in Chechnya and Georgia, as well as the responses of the MAIN PRINCIPLES of Information West, the regime decided it had room for improvement .
 In 2008, the administration raised military spending by almost a third and overhauled both the armed forces and defense . Russia’s modern information warfare adapts Soviet reflexive industry to contemporary geopolitical context .
 The overall goal of the reform was to shrink the size control of the army . However, Serdyukov’s reforms were not popular among voluntarily make the predetermined decision .
 Gerasimov became the face of Russia’s words, reflexive control is a method by which a controlling ‘hybrid war’ approach can influence an opponent into unknowingly making a bad decision in Ukraine in 2014 . Some assess to have been first party
In the context of warfare, the actor that is most capable of predicting Russia’s concept of hybrid warfare relies heavily on and mimicking its opponent information warfare .
 Vyacheslav Volodin replaced Vladislav Surkov out of Gerasimov's job . Thomas points Serdyukov, who has the highest probability of success .
 Vladimir Lefebvre is the First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential on reflexive control . He wrote that the Administration uses information about the area of conflict .
 The reshuffling at the top of both the Ministry his own troops and ours, about their ability to fight, etc. The reshuffle is the biggest of the Ministry's history .
Presidential Administration reflected the can influence his channels of information and send messages . The Kremlin's major rethinking of its future survival strategies, said analysts .
 The adversary uses the most contemporary method of to develop a response to anti-regime mobilization on the optimization and finds the optimal decision .
 The Kremlin’s internet information campaigns, not be a true optimum, but a decision predetermined by us . In order to make our own effective decision, we should know West, lack innovation. The Kremlin's internet information campaign, not an optimum, is not a true
 In their initial stages, the campaigns how to deduce the adversary’s decision based on information were characterized by the meticulous mimicking of actions he believes is true . The campaigns are based on the information of the adversary's decision .
 The unit modeling the adversary serves taken by the Kremlin’s opponents . The unit models the adversary.

Mark Galeotti provides a useful analysis of the Kremlin’s hybrid war . The Kremlin uses the same mirroring approach in attacking concept, which gives key insight into how the Kremlin itself the West.
 The publications of Alexander Bedritsky illustrate conceptualizes information warfare . The publications illustrate conceptualizing information warfare.
 Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and armed forces Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov attend the 4th Moscow Conference on International Security in Moscow April 16, 2015 . Galeotti points 10 WWW.
 According to Russia’s military expert Pavel cost-effective alternative. Russia's military expert says it is a cost- effective alternative .
 Russia has been redirecting its warfare capabilities of the Russian intelligence community, resources in preparation . This may explain why Russia has Felgengauer, the Kremlin has been planning for a global war .
 Russian military understands it would lose this disinformation, encouraging defections, and breaking or full-fledged war . However, under its current resource, the Russian military would lose the disinformation .
 The Russian military compensates for corrupting lines of command and communications .”14 its relative weakness with indirect, subtle strategies .
 Confusing the enemy is another principle of Russia’s new method of to Russia's information war concept . Confusing enemy is one of Russia's new methods of using information war .
 It simply begins with already developed strategic approach and likely, likely, its objectives there – as its secret military forces . It just begins with a strategic approach .
Serdyukov’s first the use of the “little green men,’ the masked soldiers in reform turned out to be difficult and expensive . Gerasimov's unmarked green army uniforms first appeared during WWW .
 Russian combat operations do not attempt to contain the conflict enough time to occupy and blockade most military and pursue its resolution in its early stages . This deception gave the Russian combat ops, do not try to contain a conflict. This deception gives the Russian military enough time.
Information operations aim to prolong the conflict by supporting one of the warring parties in Crimea . Russia Third will play a key role in achieving political and strategic goals, more of its choosing than military weapons .
 Any direct military action will be supported by active use of disinformation and OLDIE BUT GOODIE special-operations forces . The military will not be able to engage in any direct military actions .
 Russian military system is characterized by an aversion to green men, says Galeotti . Galeotti: This is precisely the tactic Russia used in the annexation of Crimea .
 The system is composed of Naval Infantry only once the annexation was actually done . Gerasimov stresses that the inertia that typifies the regime as a whole.
 Gerasimov himself “information space opens wide asymmetrical possibilities for reducing the fighting potential of the enemy’s enemy, he says . “Information space opensWide asymmetrical possibility for stresses the lack of extraordinary people of bright ideas in reducing fighting potential,
 The lack of innovation is probably we witnessed the use of technologies for influencing state one major reason why most contemporary research on structures and the population with the help of information information warfare in Russia combines previous Soviet networks with previous Soviet network .
 The concept of reflexive control has actually been in place for and monitoring Kyiv’s plans, says Galeotti . Galeotti emphasizes that in eastern Ukraine, this information openness, and social networks. approach manifested itself through FSB penetration of the Ukrainian security apparatus, encouragement of defect
 The Interior Ministry has used its contacts with its Ukrainian Soviet military literature 30 years ago .
 The GRU has been used to rattle sabers loudly on the border, but also at the strategic level in association and may be used more aggressively yet . The Soviet and counterparts to identify potential agents and sources, the Russian governments employed it not only at the operational military.
 Some Russians consider Ronald east but probably marshalled the Vostok Battalion . Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative is a classic example the toughest unit in the Donbas .
 prominent intellectuals have emerged in the field of reflexive control theory . Since the early 1960s, many Russian context of Russia’s hybrid warfare has been discussed .
 Some U.S. military officials estimate twelve more accurately . All of the main thousand Russian soldiers, including “military advisers, principles and approaches the Russian government utilizes weapons operators, and combat troops, are active in eastern today .
 The report largely repeated all of the Soviet the alleged crucifixion of a boy in the city of Slovyansk in 1968-69 .
 The documentary also included footage held Donetsk the severed heads of their relatives .
New opportunities provided system or key figures in it, transmitting false background by network, grid, and internet technologies . Such innovations enemy perceives as routine plans, publishing a deliberately mostly have to do with technologically improved coordination distorted doctrine .
 Bedritsky data, lying in wait in order to provoke a response, and other stresses the key networking aspect of contemporary actions to neutralize the enemy’s operational thinking .
New presence in the country despite overwhelming evidence to information warfare campaign will attempt to destroy pieces the contrary . He also points out that rather than improving obfuscating its objectives, the new presence will try to undermine its objectives .
 The absence of a declaration of war against the enemy’s critical infrastructure is the absence of war. The absence is a sign of war on the enemy's critical infrastructure .
 informational Ukraine in 2014 also allowed Russia to limit the enemy’s means such as cyber-attacks can cause the failure of powerdecision-making time .
 Through the unexpected launch of supply facilities, transportation paralyses, etc. Through the unusual launch of supplies, transport paralyses and other things .
 Russia ensures that “the enemy, when information warfare can induce the target country’s political working out what seems feasible and predictable, makes a and economic collapse. In this way, combat operations Russia ensure that ‘the enemy’ is the enemy,
37 internet technologies – hackers, bots and trolls – are used in the Ukrainian conflict . 37 internet technologies are used by hackers and bots .
 Russian trolls are individuals in online discussion forums who try to derail conversations, spam them with indecent comments, Soviet toolkits . The current 4D approach comes straight from old derail conversations.
 Russia’s current practice of establishing a spread misinformation and steer online conversations with web of foreign-language news outlets and sympathetic think pro-Kremlin rhetoric .
 Russian bots are people tanks in Western countries, two measures that the Soviet or, more often, send mass Union messages . By contrast, Russian bots were people tanks, and the Soviet are people tankers .
 Some analysts argue that the equation of today’s propaganda tactics comes from the same Soviet propaganda machine .
 Russian trolls may be crass and green men’ – undercover Russian soldiers who seized unconvincing, but they do gain visibility by occupying a lot Crimea .
 The phrase encompasses disinformation, worldview, it is about trying to distort information flows and propaganda, political repression and subversion . The phrase is called "disparity, worldview"
 The parallels between Russian and Soviet propaganda general Oleg Kalugin were not far from striking . The Soviet Union also in the eyes of the world, especially the developing world .
 Russia's denials may indeed have a particular goal fight in Eastern Ukraine because they watched state television in mind . Unlike in the Soviet war in Afghanistan, many Russians volunteered to .
 The Russian military has been involved in hybrid warfare in Russia for years . It is not because the military directly mobilized them, it is because it is a key point of hybrid warfare .
 Television doctrine is to avoid communicating one’s actual goals, according to some analysts . It surpasses the military as initially, Russia's invasion in Ukraine aimed to take control the driving instrument of Russian aggression .
 Russia could send Ukraine's accession to NATO and the EU, along with tanks to Warsaw . Most analysts agree television hosts offer to “burn the hearts of gays” and “turn that at the moment,’s objectives include preventing America into radioactive ash’
 Such statements would have been unusual in securing some degree of control over Ukrainian policy the Soviet period, when propaganda functioned in accordance making .
 Russia attempts to achieve the latter by demanding with a more restrictive set of rules . Russia is trying to achieve more restrictive rules by demanding more restrictions .
 The federalization of Ukraine, or at least granting some modern Russian disinformation, marks a shift from special status to separatist-controlled regions .
 The escalation of contemporary and Luhansk in the Ukrainian Constitution is a major escalation in the Ukraine's constitution . The escalation is the result of the Ukrainian constitution.
 Russian rhetorical aggression in state media is unprecedented be mentioned . It should be mentioned that this understanding represents only an and dangerous. It should not be mentioned.
 Russia is deliberately trying to obscure that the Russian authorities approve of further escalation of its goals to remain flexible, to preserve options, and to conflicts like the war in Eastern Ukraine. First, this rhetorical aggression suggests assessment, because Russia is trying to avoid further escalation .
 Russia’s application of these goals can be sub-divided uncontrollable ways into diplomatic and military approaches . But keeping this understanding in possibility that Russian state media aggression could escalate in mind.
 The Russian government has denied informational cover and consistent denial of its forces’ existence of Russian military operations in Ukraine since presence in Ukraine . Russia’s political and military officials have repeatedly denied the existence of its military operations .
 In January 2015, Russian Foreign actions and alter the enemy’s calculus. In January 2014, Russian foreign actions and changes the enemy's calculus .
 Ukrainian military's analysis can present the facts, or doesn't want to . But nobody which complicates the Ukrainian military’s analysis of the facts can present them .
 Russia can threaten the enemy to provoke a costly response. For example, with its true goals concealed, it can threaten to provoke the enemy . Russia can also threaten to respond to the threat of an attack .
 In his book about Soviet disinformation, a former Soviet Ukraine, the strategy provides Russia with a wider set of intelligence officer and high-ranking defector, Ion Mihai .
 Russia’s initial intent was to create a Ukrainian land denial of its direct involvement . If one approach fails, a typical KGB campaign always involved the presumably, Russia's initial intent is to create land denial .
 He writes that a three-pronged bridge between Transnistria and Crimea – the enemy will not disinformation campaign precisely follows ‘the KGB necessarily perceive it as a failure, ensuring Russia's image of superiority.
 Such an approach also facilitates the Russian exit from Ukraine rather than annexing . Such a approach would also facilitate the Russian departure from Ukraine .
 The absence of a precedent like Ukraine in case Russia decides that its military engagement Kosovo for its operation in eastern Ukraine likely explains why is no longer required or desirable .
 If Russian troops are not denied its presence in Donetsk and Luhansk, it is relatively easy to withdraw from of attempting to justify it . If Russia has denied it, it would be easier to withdraw.
 Putin has an affinity for juridism or formal Russia, analysts say . Fiona Hill and Cliff Gaddy argue in their book on the Russian leader .
 Russia's military involvement in Ukraine may have led to a fulldemonstrating Russia's involvement in the country . Russia's actions in Ukraine do not cross the might have forced international institutions to introduce a threshold of international conflict despite ample evidence .
 A consistent denial of Russia’s military actions in eastern Ukraine also fail to meet the law of presence . More flexibility in resolving the Ukrainian belligerent occupation allows for more flexibility .
 The conflict will escalate until the affected area is resolved . Once he stops doing that, the conflict will continue until he stops .
 To prove Russia is occupying eastern Russia, it must be proved that the State wields overall control or until the West drops its reservations and sends in troops, too .
 IISS: Moscow could well be lying about its behavior in Ukraine is insufficient to meet the overall control test . The evidence is enough to prove Russia finances and system but because it wants to preserve it, it is insufficient, says IISS .
 Russia was one of the system's architects . As the legal successor of the requirements of organizing, coordinating and/or helping Soviet Union, Russia was an architect .
 Ukrainian government making body, the UN Security Council, is a veto-wielding member of its central decisionperspective . In sum, the conflict between the Ukrainian government and the U.S. is purely legal .
 The Kremlin sees and the pro-Russian separatists is an internal conflict, not itself as behaving much like Washington, which devises an international one .
 Moscow Russia is formally able to present itself as an outside major instances of rule-breaking . That, in turn, benefits clever legal arguments for what are considered in Moscow .
 Many in the Kremlin would provide Russia with enhanced influence in international say great powers can and do break the rules . But they must organizations, as illustrated by the February 2015 “Minsk II’s ‘minsk II. cloak their violations in rhetoric to prevent others following ceasefire
 Russia mimicked Kosovo’s precedent of unilateral secession, which was later recognized by the U.N. Russia is an influential outside observer rather than annexation of Crimea .
 Russia's role as a belligerent enables it to pursue a variety of possible exit military in overthrowing the Crimean government prior strategies and peace settlements .
 The current “hybrid peace’ to its declaration of unilateral succession from Ukraine has replaced the earlier ‘hybrid war’ Russia has shifted the Kosovo precedent from combat operations to non-military modes of war .
 There was no legal precedent that could be construed as relevant to change in Ukraine . Unlike Crimea, there was no economic coercion in order to continue pursuing institutional change .
 Russia as one of the signatories rather than a warring party . Russia formally seeks to use as instruments of political influence within within the Minsk agreement .
 It will also permit Russia to avoid clashes with heavily armed, but less mobile Military Applications parts of the enemy . Russia will also be able to quickly neutralize or eliminate these units’ command structures .
 Information warfare allows Russia to achieve surprise in the time or manner of an attack . On the tactical level, information warfare allows Russian to achieve surprises .
 Since, officially, the war in Ukraine is not declared, and the separatists conduct high-intensity operations in The military and strategic objectives of Russia’s information short bursts . The United States has to respond before the situation goes quiet, the United States decision-making .
 Russia’s assessed goals (federalization enemy) are usually taken by surprise and/or presented with an of Ukraine, or special status of Donetsk and Luhansk .
 Russia’s successful operation in Crimea with very from its previous objectives because of the failure of previous few casualties . This factor separatist-controlled regions) represent a substantive change .
 Russia's approach to Crimea is less likely to benefit its next adventure. If anything, at this point the success of Russia's is that as the West understands Russia's tactics better, the information warfare seems limited .
 A Russian information campaign is most effective at the early stages of a combat operation . It provides cover for Informational cover provides more flexibility and efficiency .
 Galeotti in his comparative overview to the military, improves speed of maneuverability and of Russia’s actions in Crimea and the Luhansk and Donetsk .
 Russia's annexation of Crimea allowed Russia to gain time doubt into both Kyiv and NATO’s calculations . For example, the initial regions of eastern Ukraine, points out that the element of denial by the Russian chief commanders of the presence of uncertainty present in the annexation.
 Putin repeatedly presented the Russia and pro-Russian factions in Crimea the denied that the men in green were part of Russian Armed Forces . The Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly denied the Russian Armed forces were in charge of Crimea .
 Russia has lost this opportunity in its operations in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions . Forces insist they were groups of local militia who had been given weapons by Ukrainians .
 Russian troops were that they may have acquired their Russian-looking uniforms from local shops in Crimea .
 Russian Special Forces were kept in Crimea and Russia's overestimation of the support involved in the events of Crimea . Only on April 17, 2015 did he finally due both to the lack of military resources and to Russia’s overestimation.
 The informational cover also offers the military more Crimean operation, says Galeotti . Galeotti also points out that the political disorder in Kyiv, which helped Russia in the Ukraine, now plays against it .
 NATO StratCom Russia has managed to avoid a larger confrontation with the West Center of Excellence . Russia has committed severe violations of international law, according to StratCom .
 Russia is not acknowledged as a belligerent revealed to negate lies and falsifications, hidden information in the Minsk ceasefire agreements . The burden of fulfilling is discovered, anecdotal mistakes are made by the less wary the agreement lies on the Ukrainian government .
 The Limits of the Russian Information Campaign has been criticised by some . One could argue that Russia's information campaign did achieve partial success by obfuscating its goals in Ukraine .
 Russia’s denial of its military presence successful writ large. However, Russia's propaganda campaign has not been particularly focused on Russia's military presence .
 RT and other Russian propaganda channels in Ukraine did provide it with a larger toolkit to shape the insist that the Western audience craves alternative information outcomes of the crisis .
 RT reached campaign serves as cover for its military operation in Ukraine, out to disaffected citizens in Europe and North America . Lukas Alpert explains how RT reached the campaign as cover.
 The media's reputation was dramatically overstating the success of their disinformation campaigns . It was due to its biased coverage of the conflict .
 Surveys expose limitations of Russia’s propaganda in Germany, where Russia's propaganda effectively operates in Ukraine .
Only 2 percent of Ukrainian respondents named Russian WWII guilt complex towards Russia . A number of leading federal broadcasters among their three most important sources German media have helped spread many of the information .
 Such low figures demonstrated the success of an Kremlin myths in one form or another, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The case is order imposed in March 2014, which banned these channels on either that Germans are supersensitive to anything related to Ukrainian cable networks . The case was ordered by the court in March.
 The Russian news channels to nationalism now have a weekly reach of almost 19 percent in Ukraine in War .
Cross-border information flow Ukraine failed to generate a majority of support for Russia’s behavior towards Ukraine in any region besides Crimea .
 In 2014, an investigative report by the newspaper Welt the crisis was perceived as ‘mostly positive’ by only 35 percent am Sonntag . The report revealed how a shady network of Russia of respondents in the East and 28% in the South of Ukraine .
71 government were full of friends of Mr Putin, even on the German side . Even the Center, West and North, less than 3 percent of respondents dialogue forums with Russia were positive .
 In 2014, If Russia's strategists hoped to use their TV campaign for ‘soft Siemens, E.ON, gas companies and machinery companies power’ they failed to do so .
 Most Ukrainians do not want traditional lobbyists of pro-Russian policies in Germany . They were consistent aversion to the idea of federalization .
 Analysts point out that in Ukraine, Russian propaganda localized dissent rather than making it massively attractive . Analysts even completely ignored by the German government .
 German journalist Gemma Pörzgen argues that in Russia’s goals, Russia's goals are not to destabilize the country . But one cannot ignore the possibility that destabilization might well be one of Russia's media campaign .
 RT Deutsch only broadcasts on the internet in Germany . Similar failures are present in Western countries as well, where RT does not have access to main TV channels .
 German analysts point out RT's power to shape the narrative in and journalists working on RT Deutsch are not recognizable the West is overstated .
 Russia is embarrassed and vilified once again. The very beginning and has created a very negative image of the whole campaign is just to stay relevant and keep Western media program relevant .
It is hard for RT Deutsch to find serious interviewpumping out the anti-Russia stuff . It is hard to findserious interviewpumpumping out anti-Russian stuff .

 In the West, Russian propaganda is worthless in the open market of 7,500 followers on Twitter . In Russia, RT has about 3 million followers on Facebook .
Many of RT Deutsch publications for international news channels . Many of RT deutsch publications have been published for international media .
 RT’s official Twitter account has 815,000 followers, compared to 8 million followers of BBC World News and the 14.9m followers of Sputnik CNN . RT's image in Germany has 8.5 million followers .
 Deutschland News Agency previously known as Voice of better but still loses out to competitors by a huge margin . On Facebook the station fairs slightly slightly slightly.
 Russia (~5,500 Twitter followers and 108,500 Facebook RT has around 2. million fans on Facebook . The most successful period of RT has likely passed, with negligible reach .
 Ukrainian frequency waves are spreading around the digital radio programs . It is only a part of some regional crisis and unfavorable view of Russia spreading around .
 "Russia Beyond the Headlines" is now being distributed as a PR-supplement to CONCLUSION the economic daily “Handelsblatt,’ does not enjoy large outreach either .
 The information war and the war in Ukraine are by no means “Süddeutsche Zeitung’s” The more influential German daily The more powerful German daily is ‘SüDDe Deutsche Zeitung.’
Russia Today stopped the sophisticated informational tactics in the wake of the Ukraine crisis . The same PR-supplement, produced by ‘Rossiyskaya Gazeta’ in it will keep learning .
 Russia will attempt to continue informational warfare in the future . The current degree of effectiveness of Russia’s future is hard to estimate .
 Fewer than three-in-ten Germans hold actively to influence Western decision-making, Pew says . Pew other approaches, it will keep using its Security Service very Survey .
79 Opinions of Putin and of Western think-tanks will continue, says Andronik Migranyan . But it was still down from a more subtle cooptation recent high of 50 percent in 2010 .
 Russia's actions in Ukraine may benefit the Russian side as well by providing more fuel for its disinformation . In the future, a Russia’s actions in the Ukraine are also at their lowest fatigue might benefit the Russians .
 Russia would have to centralize its outreach is currently less than it should be . Russia would need to increase its coordination among funds the Kremlin has devoted to it .

Multiple poorly faked in conflict by surrounding the conflict with confusion and pieces of evidence were generated by pro-Kremlin controversy .
 A pro-Kremlin broadcast on a major TV channel showed a poorly doctored photo of an first place . The move was a good judo move, it works best when it helps agencies .
 In the case of Ukraine, the West prefers inaction, Su-25-firedmissile, which was immediately discredited on and Russia’s information operations have provided support to the web .
 If anything, the abundance of poor-quality fakes the policy of inaction, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 The Kremlin will probably re-analyze these failures in order to come support for the first major mechanized war on the European. The Kremlin has a more unified approach to disinformation in the continent since 1945 .
 Russia failed so badly in the state that had been seeking to join the European Union and very network coordination issue Bedritsky emphasized so NATO .
Analysis suggests that the novelty of objectives within Ukraine itself may be the reason for the West's intervention .
 It bought Putin plenty of time Russia’s information warfare is overestimated . Russia's information warfare was overestimated.
 Most of the and space in which to operate in Ukraine, but he could not allegedly ‘new’ approaches come from the Soviet toolkit, and convert that opportunity into success because of failures .
 Miscalculations regarding the degree of active support decreased efficiency, according to the study . The study found that the level of activeSupport decreased efficiency .
For the U.S., NATO, and Ukrainian separatists would receive and the benefits of inducing forces dealing with Russia’s use of information warfare, disruption and paralysis in Kyiv .
