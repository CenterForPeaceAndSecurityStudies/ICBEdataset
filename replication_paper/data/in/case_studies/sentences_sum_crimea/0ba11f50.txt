 Russian-backed rebels entrenched themselves in a newly captured town in southeast Ukraine . President Vladimir Putin bluntly strengthened Moscow's hard-line position that the government in Kiev must be compelled to negotiate regional autonomy .
 Analysts saw several Kremlin goals. Behind the message, and the wider military operation, analysts saw several goals .
 Putin wants to force terms, first laid down in March, built around political changes in Ukraine that would weaken central government authority . The country cannot escape Moscow's orbit and certainly never join NATO or other important Western alliances .
 Russia wanted to take the pressure off the increasingly beleaguered rebel forces in Luhansk and Donetsk, which were at risk of capture by government forces, hence robbing Moscow of important leverage .
 Third, there was possibility that Russia was trying to establish a land route to Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula seized in March .
 Analysts noted that such a change in policy would mean a notable shift in policy . Such a change would be a notable change, though, they said .
 The Kremlin raised the pressure by increasing its support for the breakaway republics in southeastern Ukraine . Ukraine has shown no willingness to negotiate, the Kremlin says .
 Putin accused Ukraine of stalling for time, hoping to control rebels rather than talk to them . Putin in separate remarks at a nationally televised question-and-answer session with student supporters .
 Russian troops and weaponry are creating momentum for a counteroffensive along a significant new front . Mariupol, a key southeastern seaport, is one of the region's biggest cities with nearly half a million residents .
Evidence of Russian presence was abundant, including unmarked Russian military vehicles without license plates . But evidence of a Russian presence is abundant.
 A cashier at a Novoazovsk grocery store said Russian soldiers had purchased sausages and cigarettes . The store said soldiers had bought sausage and cigarettes.
 The military commandant of the town, Svet, said the soldiers there were with the Army of Novorossiya . He offered only his nickname. The soldiers were not with the main separatist groups, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics .
 The militiamen flew the flag of "Novorossiya" or New Russia . The flag is a reference to Russia's historical claims over the area in southeast Ukraine that encompasses the Donetsk and Luhansk regions .
 Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of increasingly brazen military aggression . Russia has sent troops, tanks, tanks and other weapons across the border to support the Ukraine rebels .
 The Kremlin has denied the accusations and a top rebel leader asserted that any Russian active duty soldiers fighting in Ukraine are volunteers on vacation . The Kremlin denies the accusations .
 A takeover of Mariupol would go a long way toward helping the separatists gain control over land that would connect Russia to Crimea . A takeover would go far toward helping them gain control.
 Russia lacks a land link to the peninsula, and the ferry route farther south has become a major bottleneck . The ferry route further south has also become a big bottleneck .
 Analysts say that would mean occupying a lot of Ukrainian territory where there is little pro-Russian sentiment . But they say it could be a costly, bloody occupation of the type Putin has thus far sought to avoid .
 The specter of a wider war might help President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine convince citizens that some compromise with Russia is necessary .
 Ukraine tried to align the country more with the West on Friday . But the initial reaction from Ukraine on Friday was to try to align it more with West .
 The Ukrainian prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, announced a new bill to cancel Ukraine's status as a nonaligned country . The bill would also cancel the country's aspirations to become a NATO member .
 The proposal was considered unlikely to advance, as NATO cannot accept new members with disputed borders . The proposal is considered unlikely.
