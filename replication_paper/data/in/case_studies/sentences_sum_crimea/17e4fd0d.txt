 In both political and acaKEYWORDS demic discourses, Ukraine is often characterized as a country Ukraine’s East-West divide . The country is divided between Western and Eastern regional and societal parts .
 Ukraine as a “failed state’s’ state structure on the brink of disintegration and collapse, says CNN's John Sutter . Ukraine is a feeble state structure, Sutter says . Ukraine's recent upheavals in the life of the country,
 The ﬁndings in this study challenge both of these claims and it is argued that Ukraine is not a deeply divided or failed state .
 The East-West political polarization line has been moving from west to east since the early 1990s . In practice, the line is not clearly deﬁned, but to the extent that it does surface in the political and electoral contests .
 The shifting of the polarization line implies that political and cultural identities in Ukraine are not ﬁxed and at the same time, reﬂects a strengthening cohesion of Ukraine’s political andcultural space .
 The Euromaidan and Russian military aggression has led to an everincreasing convergence of Ukrainian society following the Ukraine-Russia conflict .
 Russia's recent military aggression against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity has been at the core of Russia’s recent aggression . Russian leadership's subsequent actions and statements have been a key part of the Russian military aggression .
 In this speech Putin referred to the entire Southern and Eastern part of Ukraine as the “territory of the historic South of Russia’s historic South.’ In the speech Putin called the whole of Ukraine an ‘arbitic’
Military incursion and active steps aimed at dismembering the country. It is not surprising that these ideas eventually culminated in the military incursion .
 Putin’s orders to occupy and annex Crimea as well as instigate and fuel the conﬂict in Donbas by arming, staﬃng and supervising the Russian proxies .
 Russian intellectuals are retranslated through the writings of illiberal but inﬂuential Russian intellectuals . Nowadays, these ideas are re-translated, among other means, through writings of the illiberal .
 In a chapter of the book with the telling name “Geopolitical decomposition of Ukraine,” Dugin maintained that Ukraine was an artiﬁcial formation, composed by some Russian and Western cultural strata .
 Since the 1994 presidential election (and particularly the Orange Revolution in 2004), this idea has been widely circulating in Western political and scholarly discourses . Since the 2004 Orange Revolution, this idea is widely circulated in the West .
Historical dominance of the cultural and religious entities in Ukraine determined two opposing political identities today, according to Huntington .
 Dugin's and Huntington’s accounts of the Ukrainian divide cannot diﬀer more in their contexts, methodology and scientiﬁc relevance .
 Putin claims Ukraine is split between Eastern and Western cultural and political entities making it a feeble state structure with a signiﬁcant risk of disintegration .
 Such a stereotypic view of Ukraine has not been conﬁned to the works of the Kremlin’s propagandists at home and abroad . Neither has it become history in Western writing on Ukraine.
 The Huntington-type account of Ukraine, evoking the two claims, continues capturing the imagination of many analysts and scholars .
 It attempts to demonstrate that each of these ideas has signiﬁcant problems when they are applied to present-day Ukraine .
 The analysis in this paper starts from identifying a politically meaningful division line that can potentially have the qualities and consequences for Ukraine mentioned above . The analysis begins from identifying the political implications for Ukraine .
 The consistency of accounts akin to Huntington and Dugin requires that an objective cultural and regional fault line, splitting Ukraine into some Eastern and Western parts, is suﬃciently entrenched and stable .
 The line’s salience should be signiﬁcant to the extent that it reduces the potential of the Ukrainian political society to a grossly ineﬃcient or even failed state . The line's salience is also signi �
 The analysis will consider the spatial representation of political polarization in independent Ukraine’s electoral geography . The dividing line along the East-West axis should be easy to spot .
 More speciﬁcally, it will focus on the patterns of regional distribution of support for the political forces categorized as mainly pro-Western or pro-Russian .
 The study examines the quality of the societal cohesion in contemporary Ukraine . Then, in the second part of the article, the study proceeds to assess thequality of the country's social cohesion .
 In the latter case, the acute political crisis and subsequent external military aggression would likely put such a state on the verge of disintegration and collapse .
 It will be argued that in Ukraine these challenges failed to trigger an outcome even remotely resembling the condition of a failed state . In Ukraine, the challenges have not been able to trigger a successful state, says the author .
 The allegation about an artiﬁcial and fragile structure of the Ukrainian political community altogether. Together with the anticipated ﬁndings in the other sections of the paper, this shall question the allegation .
 The ﬁrst national poll saw a two-side political polarization of the country along the East-West axis . The election was conducted in independent Ukraine . It was the very   election conducted inIndependent Ukraine .
 Leonid Kravchuk faced Viacheslav Chornovil in the presidential election of 1 December 1991 . The former highranking Communist apparatchik faced his main rival in the election .
 The latter was a key ﬁgure of the Soviet-era dissident movement . He represented the center-right national-democratic camp of the evolving Ukrainian political spectrum .
 This political faction was the key anti-Soviet force that propelled Ukraine to national sovereignty . This political group was the main anti- Soviet force that helped Ukraine to sovereignty .
 The national democrats suﬀered a crushing defeat in the ﬁrst round of the vote . Yet, the national democrat su ﬀers a crushing victory in the  vote .
 Galicia was the only region apart from the capital, Kyiv, where he failed to win .
Political projects that with some reservations could be regarded as pro-European, began gaining in popular support . Nevertheless, soon political projects were gaining support .
 This time the political and electoral dividing line moved eastwards quite considerably . This time, this time, it moved eastward quite considerably.
 This election turned into a tight race between the incumbent Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma . The incumbent is a center-leaning former ‘red director’ and a native of the industrial East .
 In this election, Kravchuk positioned himself as a guarantor of independent Ukrainian statehood . He was closely associated with the prodemocratic part of the political elite .
 Kravchuk was a clear winner in the West and large parts of the Center . Kuchma dominated all Eastern and Southern regions, while Kuchman dominated all eastern and Southern areas .
 The regional polarization of the vote was most acutely felt between the most Western part and the most Eastern and Southern regions of Ukraine . The region's regional polarization was most acute felt between Western and Eastern regions .
 The period that followed was characterized by a quite mixed picture with no clear-cut East-West line appearing out of the spatial representation of political struggle .
 Kuchma's election was a radical reverse of his initial proRussian and anti-reform rhetoric following his election to the oﬃce .
 A major restructuring of the political landscape of Ukraine took place at that time . However, a more important factor was the political restructuring of Ukraine .
 This was mainly connected with a generational change in the leadership of the center-right and centrist camps . The reshuﬄing of their respective projects, as well as with a gradual decline of a once inﬂuential non-reformed left .
 The two-side regional polarization began to resurface in the early 2000s and eventually fully materialized during the presidential elections of 2004 . The two sides began to re-emerge during the 2004 presidential elections .
 The sharp polarization of the regional votes during this election was all the more signiﬁcant . It developed into a political duel between a pro-Russian and a resolutely pro-Western candidate .
 This crisis, which came to be known as Orange Revolution, was provoked by vote rigging by pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovych .
 The Orange Revolution involved a massive and peaceful civic action of the supporters of the main opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko . It was resolved by a rerun of the second round of the election that he won .
 Ukraine appeared bitterly divided between the West and Center, on the one hand, and the East and South on the other hand . During these events, Ukraine appeared bitter divided between West and center .
 Yushchenko received 89% of votes in the West and 76% in the Center . In the rerun second round of the presidential election, Yushchen received 89%.
 He lost both the East and South to his rival, securing just 17% and 25% of the votes there . Nonetheless, he lost both East and the South to him .
 Yushchenko wins on aggregate. On aggregate, this distribution of votes brought victory to Yushenko .
 This election marked a further consolidation of the pro-European electorate in Ukraine . It also conﬁrmed the shifting of the polarization line from west to east compared to 1994 election results .
 Kuchma won the east and center in 1994, while Yushchenko won the west and the center . In 1994, Kuchm won the East and center, while in 1994 Kuchman won the West and center .
Almost an identical regional cleavage reappeared in the subsequent elections . Almost an identical Regional cleavage appeared in the next elections .
 The results of the parliamentary election of 2006 (as well as pre-term 2007 election) followed a very similar pattern . Both in terms of balance of power between the two rival camps and regional concentration of their support .
 Yuliia Tymoshenko confronted her old rival, Yanukovych, in the presidential election in January– February 2010 .
 The vote divided the country into two parts along the same line registered in the previous elections once again . The vote was divided into two part of the country in a separate vote .
 Majority of voters in all Western and Central regions preferred Tymoshenko . East and South traditionally supported Yanukovych .
 Yanukovych only won 10 of Ukraine’s regions and only over 3% more votes . The 2008 global crisis hurt Tymoshenko's electoral chances .
 The early presidential and parliamentary elections in 2014 marked a notable change in Ukraine’s electoral geography .
Pro-European forces expanded the geography of their political support to include Eastern and Southern oblasts for the ﬁrst time .
 The pre-term parliamentary election in October produced a more mixed picture while at the same time the new pattern of a shifting dividing line further to the East and South . The election was the same year as the pre-election in October .
 The Euromaidan protest and a hasty escape of Yanukovych was a key political representative of the East . Their considerable regional gains happened following the victory of the protest .
 Southern and Eastern constituencies contracted, losing a substantial share of voters . In addition, as a result of Russian occupation of Crimea and parts of Donbas, the Southern andEastern constituencies contracted .
 The former East-West line has been eroded in recent years . The favorable political context alone does not explain an apparent erosion of the line .
 The rationale of the claim about a sharply divided Ukraine encounters another serious inconsistency in the case of the country's political and electoral geography .
 Over the last 27 years, the noted East–West fault line was not only moving but at times simply undetectable .
 The analyses of Ukraine’s political and social divisions showed that a number of Ukrainian national polls never displayed the kind of stereotypic twofold polarization .
Such circumstances would have been unimaginable in a hopelessly divided society . Such circumstances would be unimaginable in the case of direct and competitive presidential elections .
 Both elections took place at certain focal moments when the course of the country’s development at least for the next 5 years was decided . Both of these elections were held in the past five years .
 The returns of these elections did not reveal a distribution of political preferences along an East-West fault line .
 In 1999 this was a clash between incumbent Kuchma and his bitter critics representing mainly the left-wing opposition . In 1999, this was the first clash between the incumbent and his critics .
Despite the high political tension, it did not follow the familiar regional polarization pattern . The political contest was generated by the political contest .
 The winning presidential incumbent secured a fairly balanced regional support of his candidacy . He beat his Communist rival in both West and East in the second round . The winning incumbent secured the regional support.
 The 2014 presidential election stands out in this context in particular in particular . The 2014 election is the first time the presidential election has been held in the same context .
 This election took place in May 2014, in the turbulent post-Euromaidan political milieu aggravated by Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its support for the bloody conﬂict in Donbas .
 It is noteworthy that while held in such extreme political and martial conditions the election did not bring about domestic confrontation or provoke tensions between diﬀerent parts of the country .
 Russian military aggression led to an abrupt regime change and the political repercussions brought about by Russia's military aggression . Such electoral success was facilitated by a regime change.
 Poroshenko's strong performance in 2014 would have been impossible without Ukrainian society's capacity to put aside any diﬀerences and unite in the face of foreign and domestic threats .
 The outcomes of the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections support the argument about the highly ambiguous East-West line yet from another perspective .
 Pluralism in post-2014 Eastern Ukraine means a growing divide between the two Donbas and the other six Russian-speaking oblasts .
 Donbas and Dnipro again have diﬀerent election results as they experienced prior to 2014 . Donbas have won two elections in a row .
 The pre-term election in July of the same year resulted in a remarkable triumph of Zelenskyy’s party .
 No candidate or political party representing a pro-Russian stance could enter the second round of presidential elections let alone win the elections .
 The elections did not follow the East-West pattern of the political contest for a diﬀerent reason . However, these elections didn't follow the pattern of political contest .
 Zelenskyy and his team succeeded in redirecting the political discourse away from the traditional ideological framework . While supporting Ukraine’s integration into EuroAtlantic structures, they also accepted Poroshenko's line on Russian aggression .
 The impressive support from Ukrainian society, in fact, may point to declining intensity of the divisive issues associated with the East–West polarization .
 The identiﬁed patterns of political and electoral polarization in Ukraine since its independence do not con ﬁrm a deep-rooted split of the country .
 The dividing line running across the territory of the country was ﬂexible and mainly moving Eastwards and hence changing it over time .
 The identiﬁcation of this trend does not mean that the political polarization line will continue shifting in the same direction or that this line will never resurface in that or another form in the future .
 The disappearance of the East-West political axis during the recent elections may well represent a temporary trend facilitated by the foreign attack and existing domestic political framing alike .
Ukrainian artiﬁndings do seem to undermine the claim about a fragmented Ukrainian landscape . However, on the one hand, these ﬁnings do appear to undermined the claim .
 The vague and moving ‘fault line’ simply does not ﬁt the idea of a deep split between some incongruent parts of the country .
 Several crucial national polls did not exhibit the stereotypic East-vs-West polarization questions . The recent 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections also did not show the polarization question .
 The next part of the article will further operationalize the dynamics of the political and cultural landscape of Ukraine . The article will consider the issue of evolution of national unity and cohesion following the Euromaidan and foreign military aggression .
 Ukraine has never represented a fragmented political, social or cultural entity . Despite its regional and cultural diﬀerences, Ukraine has not represented an artiﬁcial entity .
 A growing enhancement of the cohesion of Ukraine's society showed a marked trend over the entire post-independence period . The development is often overlooked in the writing on Ukraine's regionalism and cultural cleavages .
After more than a quarter of a century Ukraine has gone through a major and largely successful nation-building process . The dramatic events of 2013–2014 played their special role .
 The regional and cultural diﬀerences, rooted in divergent historic experiences of the country’s parts, complicated the process of forging a civic nation .
 Diﬀerences among regional political cultures, above all, were of even greater importance in this regard . Di ﬀference among regionalpolitical cultures was of a greater importance .
 Shaping of such an identity in the broader context of democratization of the nation’s political culture was a hard task . Shaping such an Identity in the wider context of democracy was a difficult task .
 It depended on the development of a strong allegiance to the evolving national community on the part of its citizens as well as socialization of new national myths and civic values .
 This was a protracted process perhaps also requiring a generation change . This was perhaps also required ageneration change .
 The acquisition of independence and construction of a Ukrainian nation-state coincided with an all-embracing systemic transformation . The acquisition. of independence.
 Under such conditions, the government and society alike were more preoccupied with introducing to and adopting to the new institutions . The government was more preoccupy with introducing and adopting new institutions than ever .
 Ukraine's economic hardships and social tensions were hardly helpful for facilitating the integration of its political and cultural space, let alone boosting of Ukraine’s national pride .
 The nation-building was overshadowed by the other constituents of the postcommunist transformation which was taking place rather unnoticed .
 Ukraine's political elites were in a position to direct and assist the democratization and nation-building processes . Ukraine has suffered a considerable disadvantage for its political elites, says the writer .
 These elites were often reluctant to push for profound change mainly due to their tactical or rent-seeking motivations . These elites are often reluctant.
 The state's leadership allegedly promoted the state’s values and interests which they allegedly promoted .
 Kravchuk was born in the West; Kuchma and Yanukovych represented the East . Yushchenko came from the North-east, while Poroshenko – wasborn in the South .
 The process of nation-building involved competition of national and political as well as cultural identities and values . It eventually resulted in developing a more cohesive Ukrainian political community .
 The evolving Ukrainian political and cultural structures are gradually winning the competition over the legacy of the former regimes . The evolving political andcultural structures were gradually winning over former regimes.
This concerned the structures inherited from Soviet times in the ﬁrst place . This concerned the structure inherited from the Soviet times .
 The more Ukraine is moving away from its Soviet past, the more the values and identities Ukraine inherited from this epoch are losing their grip on Ukrainian society . The more that Ukraine was moving away over time from itsSoviet past, it is losing its grip on Ukraine .
 In the past, Galicia was integrated into the Central-European political and social environment . Also, the region of Galicia has been integrated into Central- European political andsocial environment .
 This region enjoyed relatively better conditions for developing both Ukrainian national consciousness and pro-democratic cultural patterns . This region has a better reputation for its pro- democratic cultural patterns.
 In the 1980s and early 1990s Galicia, together with the capital city of Kyiv, served as a power base for the anti-Communist and pro-independence Ukrainian movement . In the late 1980s, Galicia and Kyiv served as the power base
 Galicia was a stronghold of the pro-European and pro-democratic, but also conservative and nationalistic, political forces . Ever since, Galicia has been a bastion of pro-Europe, pro- democratic, political force .
 The multifaceted political subculture of the region constituted a rather incongruous blend of political subcultures . The region's political sub culture was a more complex and more complex than the region's.
 In this way, the shifting East-West polarization line reﬂected the cultural and ideological proliferation of the political and electoral contest .
 In the early 1990s, political polarization involved a good deal of ideological competition between the political forces mainly associated with Western Ukraine and Kyiv, on the one hand, and the rest of the country .
 The situation started to change since then, eventually leading to the evolution of a more vibrant and cohesive civic society .
 This trend has been reﬂected in the public opinion on some controversial political and ideological issues stemming from the country's complex history and culture .
 Attitudes toward Soviet past, World War II and oﬃcial language policy have traditionally had a tangible regional dimension in Ukraine .
 Previously, positions condemning the Soviet regime and discarding its heritage were mostly associated with the political elites and Western Ukraine .
 Such questions for the most part continue to divide the Ukrainian society today today .
Over time attitudes to West have turned out to be less divisive, with their appeal gradually spreading from West to East . But over time, their appeal has been less divisive.
 recognition of the Holodomor as a genocide against the Ukrainian people has become a by far dominant position in the whole of Ukraine . The Ukrainian people have become a dominant position.
 The question of granting the Russian language an oﬃcial status has remained one of the most divisive in Ukraine . In contrast, the question of giving the Russian Language an o ﬃful status remains one of Ukraine's most divisive .
 OUN-UPA has demonstrated positive dynamics for years. Even the question of recognition of the combatant status of the U.N.PA has shown positive dynamics .
 The registered shifting of the political and ideological polarization line was also linked to the changes in the ethnic and linguistic structures of Ukrainian society . The registered shift of political, ideological polarization is linked to changes in Ukrainian society.
 As many as 92% of people declare their ethnic Ukrainian identity. Now, especially after the occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory since 2014, as many as 90% declare their identity .
 Ukraine is relatively mono-ethnic compared to many other European nations . In fact, in contrast to a wide-spread belief, Ukraine is largely mono- ethnic .
 Claims about Ukraine as a cleft polity have been most eﬀectively questioned by the dramatic events of 2013–2014 .
 The Euromaidan and, above all, ongoing Russian military aggression and annexation of Crimea put the unity and sustainability of the entire Ukrainian political society to a severe test .
 It can be argued that the country has emerged from the acute political crisis and the military attack on its sovereignty and territorial integrity more consolidated .
 A clear sign of the strengthening vibrancy of the Ukrainian political community has been its consolidating civil society . The Ukrainian government has been consolidating its civil society.
 It was the latest in a row of powerful popular actions that had broken out at critical moments of Ukraine’s development . It is the latest of a series of powerful actions that have broken out.
 The Euromaidan Revolution remained a contentious issue for people living in Eastern and Southern Ukraine . The Euromsaidan revolution was a controversial issue for many people living there .
 A by-oblast analysis of the attitudes toward the Euromaidan shortly after its culmination exposed a tangible reconﬁguration of public opinion taking place in these parts of the country .
 At the same time, the Euromaidan spread to other regions inciting protests and civic activism outside the Kyiv Maidan .
 The process of demolishing of Vladimir Lenin monuments and other communist leaders followed a similar pattern . The process was initiated in Kyiv in December 2013 .
 The participation of the South and East in the revolutionary developments did not occur during the Revolution on Granite in 1990 or the Orange Revolution in 2004 . The South and West did not participate in the revolution .
 The former was a sitting protest of students against an ailing Soviet regime . The popular backing for the Orange Revolution was largely limited to the Western and Central regions .
 The energy of the vigorous and enduring civic protest was redirected toward other urgent problems confronted by the country . Later, the energy was redirected to other urgent issues confronting the country.
 Following the annexation of Crimea and the Russian-Ukrainian war in Donbas, numerous civic projects and undertakings were initiated throughout Ukraine .
 Ukrainian military in the early stage of the war. In the ﬁrst place, this concerned the moral and human resources the country was able to put up to confront the Russian adversary .
Ukrainian army was comprised of soldiers from all parts of the country .
 The origins of the deceased are fairly evenly distributed among the Western, Central, Eastern, Eastern and Southern regions . The origin of the dead is not known as the first person to die .
 Dnipro, Ukraine, has a large military cemetery festooned with Ukrainian national and red and black nationalist ﬂags . The cemetery has become a place of pilgrimage for Ukrainian patriots .
 Kuzio points out that “Putin’s military aggression is creating large numbers of military plots in cemeteries throughout eastern and southern Ukraine . Other graves of Ukrainian soldiers who have died in earlier wars.
 The high degree of correlation between the usage of the Russian language and the Eastern and Southern regions of residence in contemporary Ukraine is also indicative of the broad regional base of support for the Ukrainian army .
 The Azov Regiment of the national guard is known for the ultra-right views of its commanders and rank and ﬁle . Such active involvement of the Russian-speakers equally relates to the units entirely comprising of volunteer �akhters .
 Ukrainian troops in Donbas have been fighting in Ukraine since April 2014 . The Ukrainian army has been fighting the Ukrainian government for more than a decade .
 The patriotic allegiance of the residents of the Eastern and Southern regions to the Ukrainian state was one of the decisive factors, which helped Ukraine withstand the Russian pressure in 2014 and since since . The Ukrainian state has been under pressure since 2014 .
 The military conﬂict was localized to the Eastern regions of the Donbas . Eventually, the military Con�ctict was localized to the eastern regions .
 Russian military aggression, on the contrary, became a factor facilitating the uniﬁcation of Ukrainian political society . Russia's military aggression has been a factor in the Ukrainian political unrest .
 In the wake of Russia’s military invasions in 2014–2015 loyalty to the Ukrainian state overwhelmingly prevailed among its citizens in all parts of the country .
 In August 2015 support for Ukrainian independence reached its highest peak since 1991 . Support for Ukraine's independence reached a record high in August 2015 .
 For years the question of following either a pro-Western or pro-Russian course was considered to be an essential representation of the societal divide in Ukraine .
 The pro-Russian East contesting the pro-European West was regarded as a fundamental feature of the country . The idea of the Pro-Russian West is regarded as an important part of the nation .
Since 2014, this stereotypic picture of Ukraine has become misleading . At least since 2014, it has become more common since 2014 .
 The choice of integrating into key Western political and security organizations has become a dominant standpoint in Ukrainian society . Ukraine's choice of integration into Western political, security organizations is a dominant viewpoint in Ukraine's society .
Popular support for joining Euro-Atlantic structures and the European Union in particular . This concerns a tangible increase of popular support for the EU in particular.
 The levels of support for the pro-Russian and pro-CIS trajectory, on the contrary, have plummeted . They now receive meager backings, according to analysts .
 In the Eastern and Southern parts of the country, the support for the Western vector has been traditionally lower than in the rest of the nation .
 A similar countrywide trend has recently developed regarding the issue of integrating into international security structures . A similar trend has also been developed in the United States .
 A direct result of the Russian aggression has been plummeting support for the idea of joining the Russiadominated security union .
This reﬂects an emerged broad consensus on the impossibility of cooperating with Ukraine’s Russian neighbor on security issues . This re� conclusion is an emerging broad consensus.
 These changes have failed to erase the regional attitudinal diﬀerences in the area of foreign orientations altogether . The changes have also failed to eradicate the regional attitudes in the region .
 The collapse of the Russian-oriented foreign and security vector in the once pro-Russian Southern and Eastern regions has been a salient shift of considerable importance .
 The East and South have deﬁnitely ceased to be plainly pro-Russian . Ukraine has not become as proEuropean and pro-NATO as the rest of the country .
 This is a major development for Ukraine’s societal cohesion and domestic politics, which will also have far-reaching geopolitical consequences . This is the first time Ukraine has seen a major change in its political and social cohesion .
 The claim about Ukraine as an example of a cleft country and failed state is an exaggeration. In view of the discussion and data presented above, it can be concluded that the claim is not true .
 The eﬀects of the recent dramatic developments in Ukraine testify to the opposite. This assertion does not match the reality “on the ground,’s. It doesn’t match the truth, says the author .
 It should be obvious that no failed state can withstand a military attack on its sovereignty and integrity by a powerful international actor such as Russia .
 Ukrainian society is not free of regional diversity, which has become a target of political manipulation . Ukraine's military attack on Ukraine could have been possible, says the author .
 The most signiﬁcant consequence of the Russian military aggression in Ukraine will be the growth of national unity and solidarity . However, potentially the most signs of the military aggression will be national unity .
 The analysis has focused on an often-cited “East–West’s political and cultural polarization of Ukraine . The analysis focused on the problem of national integration of its political community .
 A group of Western scholars and commentators have focused on Ukraine’s fragile and regionally divided state since the mid-1990s . They continue to do so.
 Ukraine is a bitterly divided, artiﬁcial and even failed state . It is surprisingly similar to the views of Russian writers and politicians who also believe that Ukraine is bitterly divided .
 The ﬁndings in this article suggest that none of the two claims are factually correct . The � inventions in this article were made in the article .
 Ukraine's East-West cleavage is not as clear-cut and entrenched as is commonly assumed . It has been demonstrated that Ukraine’s East- West cleavage isn't as clear cut and entrenched .
 The East-West axis of political polarization, surfacing in Ukraine’s political and electoral geography, is unstable and has no boundaries .
 Ukrainian elections do not ﬁt this stereotype of a West versus East cleavage . Several crucial Ukrainian elections are crucial .
 Ukraine has experienced a steady improvement of its societal cohesion since the acquisition of independence . The country's political and social space has increased in recent years .
 Euromaidan, annexation of Crimea and the Russian-Ukrainian war in Donbas are all under way . The two sides are involved in both Crimea and Donbas .
 The Ukrainian political community has shown a noteworthy solidarity and perseverance, refuting the “failed state’s allegation as evidently invalid. In the case of the Russian military aggression, the Ukrainian politicalcommunity has shown solidarity and resilience .
 Ukrainian political space has been manifested by a strong deﬁance against Russian military aggression, particularly by Russian-speaking Ukrainians . Ukraine’s independence as well as growing endorsement of the pro-Western trajectory of the country .
 In either case, it refers to a condition of institutional disorganization and societal disloyalty with a possibility of ultimately state collapse .
 A study by Oxana Shevel implies that Ukraine’s case of societal diﬀerences, inherited from the Soviet past, is not unique but quite comparable with other nations .
