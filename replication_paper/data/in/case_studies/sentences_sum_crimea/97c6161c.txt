 Introduction War does not end with the last bullet unloaded or papers signed . The last bullet is unloaded or signed .
 The longer a conflict goes on, the harder it is to achieve peace, the longer it goes on . The longer the longer a war goes on.
 Conflicts fragment societies by aggravating existing tensions among social groups and creating new ones . Conflict societies fragment societies and create new ones, says one social group .
 Understanding these harmful consequences is a prerequisite for a realistic strategy of conflict resolution. Understanding these consequences is, therefore, a prerequisite.
 This report provides an overview of the consequences of the war in Donbas, Ukraine .
 It offers a concise overview of the key historical and economic developments surrounding the war . It also offers a brief overview of what happened in the war.
 At times, the report sacrifices some depth of analysis, but only to achieve clarity of the main message, which has two points . The report is published at the end of the year .
 The main costs in the region arise because of a policy driven humanitarian crisis. First, the main costs are the region's main costs .
 Despite being a highly militarized area, Donbas is no longer an area of active, large-scale military engagement . The area is now a less militarized region.
 Donbas is an area of a large-scale protracted humanitarian crisis affecting five million people . Donbas today is an areas of a huge humanitarian crisis .
 The crisis is a consequence of restrictive state policies imposed onto separatist areas . This crisis is by far and large, but it is a result of restrictive policies imposed on separatist regions .
 Ukrainian citizens from separatist-controlled areas to mainland Ukraine have been forced to move back . The policies were designed in the early days of the conflict to undermine pro-Russian sentiment in the region .
 Both points give only limited space for optimism for a future peace deal . Both points are not enough to make a peace deal.
 The Ukrainian government will be constrained in addressing the consequences of the humanitarian crisis . With public opinion divided, the Ukrainian government is constrained in dealing with the crisis .
 Any change to policies concerning the breakaway region is likely to face severe opposition . The region's population and political contenders are likely to oppose any change .
 This, in turn, makes chances of unification and restoration highly dependent on idiosyncratic political events . This is the case of unification, which is often dependent on political events. This is not the case for unification .
Until then, the war in minds is likely to continue and its scars to deepen . Until then, it will be a war in mind for years .
 The Cost of Conflict in Ukraine caught the Ukrainian government, and indeed global leaders, by surprise . Russia's military operation in Crimea caught the world leaders by surprise.
 Heated negotiations surrounding the destruction of Ukraine’s nuclear arsenal prior to 1994 involved speculation of nuclear war . Ukraine's national security was a critical issue even before 2014, according to the report .
 Pre-War Development Ukraine was ill-prepared to combat internal or external threats for two main reasons . Pre-war Development Ukraine is not prepared to combat external or internal threats .
 Ukraine's economy was underperforming compared to its neighbors, resulting in limited capacity to modernize its armed forces . Second, Ukraine’s economy was in poor condition compared to neighboring countries .
 Ukraine’s GDP per capita was 30 percent below the average of post-Soviet states in 2010 . It was slightly above average in 1990, although it was slightly higher in 1990 .
 Economics literature typically attributes poor economic performance to pitfalls in the implementation of market reforms and progress of state governance institutions at the early stage of Ukraine's economic and political transition .
 Powerful industrial lobbies and oligarchs used parliamentary parties to establish control over state subsidies, preserve market barriers to entry, and block implementation of equitable policies .
Political polarization was most pronounced at the extreme geographical ends of the country . It provided ground for tight political competition that resulted in a tug-of-war .
 Yulia Tymoshenko led the party with the largest number of seats in the Parliament . For example, the victory of pro-western leaders in 2004 did not result in greater EU integration .
 Ukrainian leaders are unable to establish transparent market and governmental institutions, leading to poor state governance, high levels of perceived corruption, and lack of public trust in state institutions . Ukrainian leaders were therefore unable to set up transparent markets and government institutions .
 Most of the military infrastructure inherited from the Soviet Union was not properly maintained or modernized . Ukraine’s poor economic performance in the post-transition period, as well as poor governance, was blamed .
 The Ukrainian conflict became so costly and long-lasting, it has become so costly. This, together with an unexpected military incursion from Russia, partly explains why the Ukrainian conflict was so costly . This, along with the Russian incursion, partly explain why the conflict became more costly and
 Ukraine-Russia conflict encompasses Crimea and armed insurgency in Donbas . Most of Ukraine's attention has been devoted to the latter .
 Crimea takeover did not result in large-scale fatalities and destruction of capital assets . This is because the takeover of Crimea did not cause large- scale fatalities and destroyed capital assets. This is due to the Crimea takeover.
 Russian incursion into Crimea caused two fatalities, according to available estimates . War in Donbas is estimated to have taken 13,000 lives .
 The highest spikes in casualties were in August 2014 and February 2015, shortly before negotiations in Minsk .
 Economic challenges and costs of reintegrating the Donbas region in Ukraine . wiiw Research Report. Wiiw research Report.
 The Donbas War took place in densely populated urban areas with opposing sides actively employing heavy arms to expand territorial control .
 Many cities, including the major urban area of Donetsk, were taken over by opposing forces multiple times . Many cities in the Donetsk area have been taken over.
 This caused collateral damage for civilian property and mass displacement of the local population . Unsurprisingly, this caused damage to civilian property .
 The economies of the conflict-affected regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have not improved with declining levels of violence . Ukraine’s economic downturn is the first place in the region .
 negative expectations, lack of state capacity, and a humanitarian crisis have not been addressed . This is largely because the roots of the crisis are negative expectations and state capacity .
 The Donbas region’s once highly integrated economy is now divided along the line of contact between government and separatist controlled areas . The region is now subject to severe economic restrictions .
Self-proclaimed separatists’ polities are not formally recognized by any UN member state . The self-proclaimed separatist polities have not been formally recognized.
 Any economic contract inside separatist controlled areas will bear no legal force according to both Ukrainian and international law . This implies that any economic contract in separatist areas will not bear any legal force . This is according to Ukrainian and International law .
 Five million people were affected by a humanitarian crisis that affected five million people . This resulted in a rapid contraction of the local economy and a large-scale humanitarian crisis .
 There are several key considerations in understanding the war's impact on Ukraine’s economy . Direct economic costs and the role of trade are key considerations .
 The size and structure of the Donbas economy determined the impact of local economic disruption on Ukraine’s aggregate economy .
 Donetsk and Luhansk regions accounted for around 16 percent of Ukraine's total GDP prior to the war in 2014 . Crimea’s contribution of 3.8 percent of GDP at the end of 2012, compared to 3.7 percent of the Ukraine's GDP .
 The local economy was built on mining, metal, machine-building, and energy industries, which were interconnected through a dense network of railways .
 These likely had negative spillover effects on Ukraine’s bilateral trade, say experts .
 When combined with the conflict, the region’s structure and connectedness to the Ukrainian economy caused significant economic effects . The region's structure and connection to the Ukraine economy caused economic effects.
 The conflict had a severe impact on output and productivity measured by both conventional and non-conventional measures of economic activity .
 The impact of war on Ukraine’s economy is recognized as significant in magnitude . It is estimated the average decline of GDP per capita between 2014 to 2017 by 17. percent 16 – economic contraction in the Donbas region was much stronger .
 The conflict severely disrupted regional and international trade . Second, the conflict severely disrupts international and regional trade .
 Many enterprises in the government-controlled areas were suddenly cut off from suppliers and purchasers . The measures had a significant impact on the separatist economies .
 Ukrainian energy plants no longer had access to sufficient anthracite coal to continue electricity production . Ukraine's energy plants have no access to enough anthracites to continue power production .
 Indirect estimates suggest that trade restrictions could account for at least a half of the observed economic downturn in separatist controlled areas .
 The economic effects of the conflict were severe, but the overall impact extends well beyond the economy . Humanitarian and environmental effects are severe, according to the report .
 3 million people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions struggle to secure access to food, sanitation, shelter, legal assistance, and basic public services such as healthcare and education .
 Much of that is caused by recurrent damage to critical infrastructure that provides electricity, water, sanitation, and heating . The damage to the infrastructure is often caused by repeated damage to infrastructure .
 Restrictions on movement of people and goods across the line of contact are equally important . Restrictions are also important for people and people to be in contact .
 Most public services were concentrated in Donetsk and Luhansk . Prior to the war, most public services had been in Donetsk.
 Many households from nearby locations and rural areas are now forced to commute to other cities to receive critical services such as healthcare and education . With these cities falling under control of the separatists, many households from these cities are now struggling to commute .
 The Impact of War, Politics, and International Credit on Reforms in Ukraine. The impact of war, politics, and international credit on reforms .
 In 2015, at the peak of the economic crisis in Donbas, data accounted for 2. million displaced people, 40 percent of the region’s total . In 2014, the region's economic crisis was at its peak .
The majority of this group were IDPs, with 36 percent seeking legal status in Russia . The majority of the group are IDPs .
 The integration of 1. million IDPs into the rest of the country has been a long-term issue for Ukrainian authorities .
 91 percent of IDPs face difficulties in finding employment, the average income is 40 percent below the national average . Many are unable to fully integrate into local communities (51 percent reported full integration)
 separatist areas frequently request IDP status to gain access to public services and collect pensions in government-controlled areas . This means populations of separatist controlled areas often request the status to collect pensions .
 There are concerns around technological and natural disasters . While measurable environmental damage has so far been relatively limited, there are concerns .
 Heavy metals and chemical substances could cause mass poisoning of densely populated urban areas of Donetsk and Luhansk . These enterprises could emit significant levels of heavy metals.
 At the same time, the region faces a double risk with the dense coal mining system.
 The majority of the coal mines located in separatist-controlled areas are currently idle, benefiting from no proper maintenance . The most of the mines are in separatist areas .
 If coal mines are not properly closed, the region may face irreversible environmental damage . The region may be affected by increased geological instability and contamination of ground waters .
 The political implications of the conflict is another widely discussed topic with multiple considerations . Political implications are also a major topic of discussion .
 The conflict itself is in part a result of EU-Russian tensions over Ukraine, according to the EU .
 The agreement would have guaranteed reduced tariff rates and a framework for political integration . It would have also guaranteed reduced tariffs .
 Ukrainian media says Russia's military operation in Crimea was conducted to secure the naval base in Sevastopol . separatists were supported as a way to increase polarization and undermine the process of Euro-integration .
Public support for economic integration with Russia fell sharply, with the share of respondents opposing integration rising from 28 to 60 percent . In 2014, post-2014 governments have had mixed success in integrating Ukraine with the EU .
 The unexpected landslide election of President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 did not deviate Ukraine from this path . The current government continues to promote a reformist and pro-European agenda .
Euro-integration has remained a unifying point between the two . Zelensky used the election campaign to highlight his points of difference with predecessor Petro Poroshenko .
 The impact of conflict on Ukraine’s EU foreign policy was also significant . The impact on Ukraine's foreign policy on the EU was significant .
 Ukraine became a symbol for the EU to demonstrate its commitment to support integration initiatives . Ukraine was considered to be one of the many “association countries’s many ‘association country’ for the European Union .
 The post2014 surveys most likely did not cover Crimea, the Donbas and Luhansk regions in full . The regions were strongest supporters of integration with Russia in pre-war surveys .
 In a similar vein, one can hardly find support for the negative impact of war on Ukraine’s reform progress .
Kochnev finds little to no correlation between conflict intensity and reform progress in Ukraine .
 If anything, reform progress appears to be more closely linked with the electoral cycle, and popular support of the ruling party . The reform appears to have been linked to changes in income levels, and support for the ruling Party .
 The effect of the war on political polarization in Ukraine is mostly evident in terms of preferences regarding a future peace deal . The impact of the conflict is largely evident in the preferences of Ukraine's political leaders .
 Survey results suggest residents of separatist controlled areas demonstrate positive attitudes toward Russian integration . Residents are critical of western institutions and the ruling Ukrainian elites .
 This is largely at odds with nation-wide views, which indicate no clear majority regarding future reintegration of the region . This is mostly at odds.
 A survey conducted prior to last year’s local elections indicated that 45 percent of respondents do not support the idea of a ‘free economic zone’ in Donbas .
Such differences in political preferences pose a threat to a sustainable peace deal and economic and political integration . Such differences in politics pose a risk to the peace deal, says author .
Internal Ukrainian politics is one of the most intriguing and pressing issues of internal Ukrainian politics . Whether or not it will manage to do so is a key issue for the country's future .
 It is critical to understand the most pressing issues of the war in Ukraine, says the author . The author says it is important to understand what is happening in Ukraine .
 The local Donbas population has experienced a decline in living standards by three to four times within a year, far outpacing that of the post-Soviet transition .
 This is considered to be amongst the steepest economic downturns in the 20th century . This is thought to be one of the most severe downturns ever seen .
 The immediate challenge for Ukraine in recovering physical infrastructure, markets, and state capacity is critical for mitigating the negative impact . Ukraine's economic recovery is a key part of the recovery of Ukraine's economy .
 At the same time, the conflict has prompted – even if indirectly – some positive political change in Ukraine .
 The implementation process is considered one of the major obstacles in implementing Ukraine’s long-term development policies .
 The gap in political preferences between Donbas and non-Donbas has widened, making any attempts of conflict resolution more difficult .
