 Spain battles with a growing political crisis at home . Some have pointed to Russia’s hand in it .
 The affluent region in northern Spain declared independence in late October, sending shock waves across the country and the continent .
 Some analysts have mused and others even pointed to Russia's hand in pushing Catalonia over the edge .
 Russian President Vladimir Putin told foreign policy experts in Sochi that Catalonia's breakaway bid amounted to a domestic issue . Catalonia held a controversial independence referendum on October 1 .
 Violence during the referendum provided Russian officials with ample ammunition to criticize the European Union . Pro-Kremlin allies often take a position to showcase the bloc's fault lines .
Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Catalonia's bid was an 'internal matter' of Spain .
 In 2014, Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula in an internationally-condemned referendumafter pro-European protests led to the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych .
 Madrid's violent actions against voters who took part in the independence referendum resembled Yanukovych’s deadly crackdown on the pro-European protests of 2013 and 2014 .
 EU representatives slammed Yanukovych for using the same brutal methods the Spanish police used against voters in Catalonia . Political commentator Alexey Martinov called it a 'paradox'
 The Kremlin does not openly support Catalonia’s independence bid . The region's political upheaval offers Moscow an opportunity to illustrate ‘double standards’ within the EU.
 Spain refused to recognize Kosovo as an independent state . The majority of the EU's 28 member states followed suit .
 Moscow says Catalonia is not an isolated political issue but forms part of a fate the EU sealed over a decade ago . The EU sealed the region's fate over a year ago – and one that serves its interest only insomuch .
