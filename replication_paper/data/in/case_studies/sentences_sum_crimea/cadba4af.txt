 A “CRIMEAN ANSCHLUSS’s” is a ‘HITLER ANALOGY’ The ‘RUSSia’ is a  ‘WEIMAR RUSSIA’ and a � �
 Revanchism, Irredentism, and Pan-Nationalism are among the most popular .
 The main difficulty with the Weimar Russia analogy is that there are only two cases from which to develop the correlation and hypotheses as to trends and causation . Many contemporaries viewed the comparison as strikingly apt, some held that the social and political characteristics of post-Soviet Russia would not allow a transition
 The Moscow Times ran an article calling the annexation ‘Putin’s Crimean Anschluss’ in 2014 . Hillary Clinton, Wolfgang Schäuble, Prince Charles, and several other notable figures publicly compared Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler .
 The nationalistic pan-Slavism rhetoric in modern Russian politics may resemble Hitler’s acquisition of Austria and the Czech Sudetenland prior to his invasion of Poland .
Central Europe became nation states after 1648 in the early modern period to the modern order of nation states in central Europe . These phenomena were especially fateful in Central Europe .

 The Klein Deutschland concept emerged as an option for German unity with the advent of Bismarck’s chancellery in 1862 . The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and subsequent unification of Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm I in 1871 meant that the Deutsch
 Pan-Nationalist displays were surreptitiously celebrated with the adornment of cornflowers . The singing of “Deutschland Über Alles’ instead of the imperial anthem, and the display of red, black, and gold colors .
 Georg Ritter von Schönerer was the most influential personality in the Pan-German movement of the fin de siècle . He was a leading figure in the movement of fin deSiècle.
 Schönerer notably joined anti-Semitic dogma with Pan-German rhetoric in Habsburg Austria after 1890 . Schöner notably joined the anti-Semitism dogma in the Austrian capital .
 Schönerer’s use of ethnic hatred as an explanation for the social and political tribulations of a multi-ethnic empire made anti-Semitic and xenophobic attitudes central to the Pan-German movement .
 Hitler was witness to the demagogue’s cult of personality in Vienna of the turn of the century . Schönerer lost his parliamentary seat in 1907 and likely never met the future dictator .
 Schönerer’s influence persisted as his young disciples went on to dominate municipal life in multiple provinces as civic figures,36 .
 Wolf was a journalist-turned-politician whose successes and view of Czechs as “the main enemy’s.41 would eventually distance him from his original patron in Schönerer . Wolf was also a journalist and politician .
 Stein was known for blatant attacks on the Habsburgs in favor of the annexation of peripheral provinces by the German empire . Stein was a fierce advocate of German workers and founder of the “German National Workers Association’s”43 .
59 France's stipulation that Austria surrender domestic control of its financial system was politically infeasible . Austria’s “inability to be self-sufficient’ was reflected in its loan request from the League of Nations .
 France withdrew all its assets from the Austrian Creditanstalt and precipitated a ruinous economic crisis . The Austrian banking sector, a dramatic slowdown of the Austrian industrial sector, and 30 percent unemployment .
 With the rise of railroads and modern transportation, the migrant flow of “unskilled Czechs’s” has increased sharply .
Austrians saw the National Socialist system across the border after 1933 generating jobs and creating an increasingly classless society . The withdrawal of French assets from the Creditanstalt mentioned earlier plunged the banking sector toward collapse in 1931 .
 In response, massive Socialist demonstrations and protests set fire to the Vienna Palace of Justice . Police opened fire on the crowds, killing 73 Steven Beller, Concise History of Austria .
 Nazism was markedly too radical for most right-wing Austrian politicians . It started to gain electoral victories in Vienna, Lower Austria, Salzburg and Styria by 1930 .
80 Englebert Dollfuss became Chancellor in 1932 in the wake of the financial crisis following the 1931 failed customs union . The threat from Nazism and the schism it created among conservatives served to accelerate the transition.
 The brief civil war resulted in the disbandment of the Social Democrats, the filling of concentration camps, and the drafting of a constitution that codified a fascist state in the Ständestaat .
 The consolidation of power by Hitler's Nazis in Berlin and the rise of the Austrian Nazi party in Vienna made Dollfuss suspicious of an impending Nazi takeover .
 The Führer could not control the actions of his Austrian compatriots, nor the plotting of his armed formations and a putsch was attempted by Austrian SA and SS in July . Still, the FüHrer was not able to control his compatriots' actions .
 The Ständestaat under both Dollfuss and Schuschnigg exhibited anti-Semitic undercurrents, albeit not radical measures prescribed by Schönerer and his disciples .
Much of the Austrian right advocated an anti-Republican, authoritarian, and anti-Semitic regime . But they were not satisfied with the Ständestaat .
 The Italian dictator's support gave Schuschnigg’s Ständestaat resilience against increased pressure from Nazi Germany .
 Chancellor Seyss-Inquart held his office for only two days before signing the ‘Reunification of Austria with the German Reich’ into law on the 13.105 . The cheering crowds of people adorned in Swastikas and lining the streets of Innsbruck
 More than two thirds of Austrians were in favor of independence after the invasion, according to Schuschnigg . The following month would turn that tide .
 The controversy as to whether there is a unique Ukrainian nation or whether Ukraine belongs in the Russian nation has led to a political and cultural rift in modern Ukraine and Russia .
Ukrainian identities are developing asymmetrically, tangentially, or not at all, depending on the region . Various empires ruled the territory of modern Ukraine .
 The Rus covered western and central Ukraine, most of modern Belarus, and western Russia . The area ruled by the Rus covered west and central Russia .
 It was between 1240 and the 1600s that truly separate Ukrainian and Russian identities developed,122 and diverse narratives took shape .
 Ukrainian elites became more integrated into Russian society due to relatively similar cultures . The result was an extremely Russified elite caste among Ukrainian Cossacks and an impoverished peasantry .
 The Decembrist uprising in 1825 and the suppression of the Polish rebellion in 1830 by Tsarist forces split the forces of Pan-Slavism into pro-Russian and anti-Russian camps . This policy was clear in the first Pan- Slavic congress in Prague in
1 Ukrainians under Russian rule experienced a deliberate and coordinated effort to undermine the development of a Ukrainian national identity . This idea portrayed the Germans and the Austrians as the eternal opponents of the Slavs and strengthened Russian nationalism .
 The Habsburg system allowed for schooling in the “Slaveno-Rusyn’s’ language . However, upward mobility was limited . The language is the predecessor of modern Ukrainian .
Polish rulers offered Polonization as only options for Ruthenians . The Ruthenian elite was quickly stratified into Polonophiles or Ruthensian nationalists . Most choosing the former.
 The Ruthenians were distinguished from the Poles by the turn of the century . But the imperial borders that created ‘two nationalities on one ethnographic base’ would crumble with their empires after World War I .
 Soviet post-World War II policies concerning Ukraine would further contribute to an already existential rift in the population . This would eventually backfire as the intelligentsia established a post-war cultural and civilizational symbol in the traditional Ukrainian capital .
 Southern and eastern Ukraine became a ‘multi-ethnic melting pot for all the peoples of the Empire’ with a distinctly Russian culture . The Western Ukrainians’ deep-seated hostility toward Russia continued to develop well into the 20th century .
 As the Soviet Union collapsed and independence referenda were held in the Soviet Socialist Republics, it quickly became evident that Boris Yeltsin’s concept of independence was not endorsed by Ukraine and other Soviet successor states . This contributed to the eventual disintegration of theSoviet Union and the
 Ukraine's history is rather that of a borderland between Eastern Europe and the Asian steppes it has spent its past shifting between . Historians have portrayed Ukraine as the progenitor of Russian civilization .
Under Ottoman rule, Crimean Tatar Khanate developed a trade economy based on the slave trade . The Crimean Khanate established its own Khanate state as the Mongol empire crumbled around it .
 The 1937 census recorded 47. percent of Crimean population as Russian, 20. percent Tatar, and 12. percent Ukrainian,179 . World War II and its aftermath at the hands of Joseph Stalin would change this population distribution .
 Crimea was the only province in the Ukrainian SSR that did not achieve an absolute majority of the populace . As Ukraine became an independent state, there was strife on the peninsula, notably when Ukrainian was deemed the official language .
 By the mid-1990s, the Crimean Tatar population had increased three-fold to more than 250,000 inhabitants . The severe downturn of the Ukrainian economy disenchanted many on the Crimean Peninsula with the Ukrainian government .
 Crimean Tatars constituted 70 percent of the unemployed populace and their financial hardships caused further marginalization . The Ukrainian Government viewed the Ukrainian Government as the “guarantor of their cultural and political rights’’s’
213 Days of protest followed, the protesters swaddled in orange clothing and waving orange banners . This created a confused situation, with an outgoing incumbent president (Leonid Kuchma) a nominal winner in the contested elections .
 The next month, under heavy international monitoring, new elections were held and Yushchenko won 52 percent of the vote . The ensuing years featured strife between Russia and Ukraine .
 Crimea declared independence from Ukraine and requested incorporation into the Russian Federation on March 11 . Within the week, irredentist efforts staged a referendum for the secession of Crimea on March 16 .
 In the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea, reports of human rights violations were abundant . Two days later, the Russian Constitutional Court ratified the treaty .
 The daily harassment of dissenters and the high rate of emigration240 are likely to ensure further Russification and waning dissent on the peninsula .
 The Russian majority and simmering separatist movements made the coup de main relatively smooth and bloodless . The coup deMain was a relatively smooth, bloodless.
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez compared Israel's actions in Lebanon with Hitler's genocide . Russian President Vladimir Putin has frequently asserted that there were neo-Nazi, Nazi, and fascist elements in Ukraine’s Orange Revolution and Euromaidan .

Study of English-, German-, and Spanish-language media showed that comparisons of Putin to Hitler started immediately after his election into the presidency in 2000 . Putin and the Kremlin have maintained a consistent counternarrative that neo-Nazis and fascists caused the Euromaidan ouster of Yanukovych
 An initially large “information gap’s” between policymakers and the public,286 coupled with a potential rally-round-the-flag appeal, produces a compelling galvanizing effect, says the author .
 People are more likely to associate negative correlations than if they had not heard the comparison at all . Even negative comparisons offer evidence that the reference is abundant in the media,290 .
 Toward a Theoretical Synthesis,’s Annual Review of Political Science 11: 41 .
 Professor Andrey Zubov was dismissed after writing an article comparing the Russian annexation of Crimea with Germany’s Anschluss with Austria in 1938 . In response, Aleksandr Dugin, the head of a Kremlin-affiliated think-tank,lambasted Professor Zubov
 The short-lived Deutsche-Österreich Republic sought parity between its German and Austrian parts . The isolation of Austria during the Great Depression plunged it deeper into economic crisis .
 The prestige associated with Crimea as one of the former crown jewels in Russia’s empire made it an icon of nostalgia for prior Russian power . No two cases of ethno-national irredentism likely to be identical .
 Austria had from the outset been a part of Hitler’s design for a greater Germany . Hitler made this clear on the first page of Mein Kampf .
311 the official line concerning Crimea was not revanchist. While Crimean independence from Ukraine was a point of contention for the ethnic Russians on the peninsula .
 In 2010, the lease on Russia’s military bases in Crimea was extended for 25 years from 2017 . As soon as a revolution in Kiev threatened those interests, the gears of war started turning .
 Russia surpassed Turkey as the most powerful Navy in the Black Sea . The Black Sea Fleet lease had been extended, full incorporation of Crimea by Russia removed restrictions .
 The Crimean referendum, in contrast, has been shrouded in more controversy . The existing pan-German attitudes, the endorsement by major public figures, and elimination and intimidation of the political opposition negated the need for any falsification of ballots .
 The vote in Crimea was a façade of being “in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms,” Putin referred to it, regardless of the U.N. General Assembly denunciation .
 The mysterious appearance in Crimea of Russian special forces without insignia in February and March 2014 initiated a sequence of events that resulted in a series of human rights violations . Such a genocidal agenda is absent from President Putin’s geopolitical endeavors .
 If modern neo-nationalism is analyzed with the model of fascist nationalism used by Hitler, then the successful conduct of foreign policy will inevitably be hampered .
