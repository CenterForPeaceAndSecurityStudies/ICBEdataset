 The experience, and the warm people I met in each country, gave me precious insights . I hope to enhance the effect of this thesis, he says .
 Its people are welcoming and friendly, as well as eager to be perceived as modern and European . The country's people are friendly and friendly .
 Another former Soviet Socialist Republic, Ukraine, also exists in a state of ethnic disharmony .
 This thesis explores the nature of Russia’s exploitation, and how in the last twenty-five years Russian ethnic policy has affected the modern Georgian and Ukrainian states .
 An Introduction focuses mainly on the roots of modern conflict of the Caucasus following the collapse of the Soviet Union . Also ties in the complicated and interconnected ethnic roots of the region .
 The author pays special focus toward the roots of conflict, both in 1991–1994 and in 2008 . The author identifies specific and consistent destabilizing Russian actions, from supplying arms to separatists to claiming acts of genocide .
 Zvi Gitelman’s ‘Nationality and Ethnicity in the Post-Soviet Republics’ offers a more specific view into ethnic conditions found in Georgia and Ukraine before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union .
 Gitelman’s analysis correctly identified the similar characteristics of both Georgian and Ukrainian identity . Russian exploitation in the region made Russian exploitation a viable foreign policy strategy .
First, Russia intends to create a regional hegemony, which would likely encompass most of the former Soviet territory . First, Russia wants to create regional hegemony .
 Mearsheimer's book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics and his article ‘Why the Ukraine Crisis is the West’s Fault’ would increase Russia's relative level of power .
 The thesis has identified six specific strategic methods Russia uses to exploit ethnicity in its “near abroad,’s ‘near abroad’ A phrase coined in the early 1990s to refer to the other 14 former Soviet Socialist Republics .
 Most 21 Allison, ‘Russian ‘Deniable’ Intervention,’s most 21, “Russian “Deniable ‘ Intervention” 1282 . The most 21 Allison is a Russian "Russian � ‘ Russian ‘ Deniable” Intervention,
 Russia often employs its own disaffected population, its Muslim minorities, unemployed veterans, and naïve ideologues, as a fighting reserve for separatist forces . Russia often uses its own Muslim minorities and unemployed veterans.
 Russia burrows itself into the treaty-making process and ensures its enemies come of at an extreme disadvantage at the negotiating table . Russia's enemies come at a extreme disadvantage in the negotiating process .
 Exporting Propaganda Modern Russia propagandists benefit from the vast trove of experience acquired during the Soviet Union .
 Russian networks, such as RT, Channel One, dominate the information space, and corrupt Russian-speaker’s understanding of both domestic and international events .
 In Georgia, the use of Russian media is most evident through the continuing prevalence of the Russian language in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia.
 The Russian government used this method with great effect in South Ossetia and Abkhazia . The method may have replicated it in Crimea and the Donbas .
 When the focus of the conflict shifted to Abkhazia, Russian support notably increased .
With new Russian weapons and bases of supply, Abkhazian militias renewed their attack on the Georgian-occupied regional capital of Sukhumi . The government forces from the region ultimately drove the government forces out .
 The formation of a three-way but Russian lead peacekeeping force following the ceasefires in 1991 and 1993 was instrumental to this strategy . The Russian lead force was formed after the end of the Soviet-Russian conflict .
 The study of each case focuses on strategic choices made by Russian leaders at various critical points in the history of Georgia and Ukraine . This format establishes Russia’s use of each strategic method as a cogent Russian policy .
 Polling data also provides a unique perspective on the degree of Russian policy success, especially in pro-Western or pro-Russian leanings .
 Soviet leaders acted in disparate and unorganized fashion to undermine the young Georgian state, laying the foundation for future conflict . During this first phase, individual Soviet leaders acting in disparate, un organized fashion .
 The end state of the fourth stage has yet to be determined, landmines and detours riddle South Ossetia and Abkhazia’s future path . Both de facto states continue their search for sovereignty, stability, prosperity, and international recognition .
 The Abkhazian population fought with fellow Circassian tribes against tsarist armies for decades . When Russian generals finally rooted out and defeated the rebellion in 1864, they deported much of the Abkhazi population .
 Russia ultimately supplied a majority of Ossetians arms, and allowed the free movement of 69 De Waal, The Caucasus, 140 .
 Russia was able to dictate terms at the ceasefire negotiations, enabling later Russian leaders to exploit the conflict . The conflict foreshadowed the looming Abkhazian conflict .
 Shevardnadze's former position as the Soviet Foreign Minister was now an albatross, garnering the Georgian leader credibility in the West . But derision in Moscow where support for the fledgling state was critically needed.
 Conservative Nationalists used “external threat’ from nonRussian republics of the former Soviet Union to try and direct debate over Russia’s national interest towards a more confrontational angle .
 The threat to Russian security was perceived to come from ethnic conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union, rather than from the old Cold War enemies .
 Aid first arrived in the form of ‘captured’ or “gifted’ Russian heavy weapons as well as the permissive use of Russian supply depots and operating bases within Abkhazia .
 Similar to the Ossetian conflict, the armistice in 1993 lead to the formation of a Russian-backed peacekeeping force . The Ossetians' conflict in 1993 led to the creation of a Russia-backed force .
 The War's Aftermath By the armistice of 1993, Georgia was on the verge of complete political and economic collapse . The War’s Aftermath of 1993 was by the end of 1993 .
 Georgian, Abkhazian, and Russian forces would create a three-way peacekeeping mission . Georgia’s sovereignty was severely undermined by Russia's presence in Georgia .
 Russia supplied South Ossetia with “Grad’s multiple-launch rocket systems, self-propelled artillery systems, and anti-aircraft weapons . In addition to tanks, on June 2–6, 2004, Russia supplied the country with ‘Grad
 The Russian military completely routed the Georgian army after just five days of fighting . The Russian propaganda machine kicked into high gear almost immediately .
 Abkhazian government receives annual financial aid packages from Russia . The government has grown dependent on Russia's financial aid .
 Disputes over territory and a new road to the North Caucasus demonstrate the Abkhaz leadership’s unwillingness to hand over all authority . Recent protests in June of 2015 show the country is continuing to experience domestic schisms .
Arming insurgents and supplying fighters along its frontiers is the most aggressive course Russia has taken in Georgia in the last quarter century . Arming insurgents has been Russia's mostaggressive course in Georgia.
 Russia possesses enough military hardware to provide South Ossetian and Abkhazian separatists with marginal military advantage over their Georgian rivals . Russia enjoys an enormous military advantage along all its western borders .
 Russian goals of hegemonic dominance, countering pro-Western sentiments, and a return to great power status were largely achieved in the Caucasus . But achievement has become harder to quantify since Putin's rise to power .
 Ukrainians of the Soviet era were torn over how to respond to Soviet rule . Despite these tragedies, Ukrainians were torn on how to cope with Soviet rule.
 Ukraine’s second glimpse of freedom in 20 years came following the Red Army’'s disastrous retreat ahead of the Wehrmacht onslaught in 1941 . The Red Army was forced to retreat in 1941.
 Ukrayins’ka Povstans'ka Armiya or Ukrainian Insurgent Army . The newly ‘liberated’ regions under German control sparked the short-lived success of the Ukrayin Army .
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were killed or deported by the Soviet army . Vestiges of this force fought the returning Soviet army for almost a decade, but their resistance failed .
 Russian leaders determined they could exert power by attacking weak points in Ukrainian identity . Russia's soft power prowess combined with belittling theories of ethnic assimilation.
 The tsars opened this sparsely populated region up to Russian settlement in the 1780s . Common usage of the term Novorossiya dwindled during the twentieth century .
 Failure of pro-Russian forces to replicate Crimea-like rebellions in central and southern Ukraine effectively ended any real possibility of creating a new Russian contiguous territory . The region would have connected another breakaway region in Moldova, Transnistria, to the Russian Federation .
 Language Map of Ukraine Clearly shows the concentration of Russian speakers in the east and south of the country . Language map of Ukraine clearly shows that the majority of speakers are Russian speakers .
 Both fall under the manipulate identity strategic method and form the foundation for Russia’s exploitation strategy in Ukraine . Both fall in the manipulation strategic method.
 Information warfare as a form of ‘soft power’ is wielded differently in Russia than it is in the West .
 Yanukovych and his allies received substantial political support from the Russian government . Russia essentially used Yanukovych to weaken and corrupt the Ukrainian government, and keep it on track .
 In Crimea, "little green men" undermined the Ukrainian Armed Forces' ability to respond decisively to protestor occupations of key administrative centers and prevent staging a separatist referendum .
 The coordination between the ‘little green men’ and pro-Russian protestors is a key component of Russia’s exploitative strategy . The tactic helped establish a consistent storyline of an organic, cohesive, and determined pro- Russian movement .
 The early pro-Russian separatists rallied around the belief that they were fighting against an illegitimate fascist government in Kyiv . The wholesale influx of Russian equipment, and later personnel, did not begin until summer 2014 .
3 recruits were promised high pay, the equivalent of hundreds of U.S. dollars a day, to fight and operate heavy weaponry that began to flow into Ukraine from border checkpoints controlled by separatist forces .
 Russian forces were persuaded or coerced to fight in Ukraine at later stage in conflict . It is important to differentiate these veterans who had left military service prior to volunteering .
 Russia was able to exploit linguistic and ethnic divides in Ukraine systematically . It was a wide-ranging information warfare campaign composed of both ideological and propaganda elements .
 The long-term consequences of Russia’s exploitative ethnic strategy in Ukraine are yet to be seen . Minsk II and Beyond and Beyond are not yet seen .
 Western failure opens the way for those using Putin's tactics to use them ever more widely . But this exploitation of ethnic divides can be, and has been, countered .
 The term "hybrid war" seems appropriate to define the ballet being performed in Ukraine today .
 The need to form a cogent and reasonable response often slows effective Western counterpoints from reputable media sources .
 Russia is able to build its own case, at least domestically, that it is working to regain its great power status . The dual-use nature of propaganda is helping Russia build its case, by the dual- use of propaganda .
Ukrainian society has a weakness to identity manipulation, says the author . Novorossiya is an example of the permeability of Ukrainian society, he says .
 Russian propagandists focused on Crimean referendum as its precedence . They used Crimean support for unification with Russia as a manipulative tool to undermine Ukrainian identity .
 Arming separatists alone has not been a successful method of achieving Russian strategic objectives . Arming Insurgents have not been successful in achieving Russian Strategic objectives .
 Russia's actions fly under the radar of Western willingness to respond to aggression . Arming separatists does provide enough cover to allow Russia to fly under radar .
 Russia has expanded its area of influence into the regions held by its proxies . Russia's status as a regional hegemon has been increased by arming insurgents . Russia is limiting Western access to the region through military force .
Russia has acted to confuse the true nature of Russian assistance by providing plausible deniability . Supplying Fighters has not substantially contributed to any direct gains in Russian strategic objectives in Georgia or Ukraine .
 Foreign fighters do help to increase Russia’s regional influence and undermine the pro-Western governments under attack, according to CNN .
 Russia failed in its attempt to decrease Western influence in Georgia and Ukraine by perpetuating frozen conflicts . Russia can also use continued economic and military superiority to back separatist armed forces .
 Russian meddling has solidified the anti-Russian and pro-Western leanings of a majority of each country’s population . Instead, Russian meddling is solidifying the pro-Russian leanings.
 Russia's great power status remains unseen. What long-term effect sustaining frozen conflicts has had on Russia’s power status is unseen .
 Russia’s divide and rule ethnic exploitation strategy has not been paying off . Russia's divided and ruleethnic exploitation strategy is not paying off, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The Baltic States, Belorussia, and Kazakhstan are all at risk of the same ethnic manipulation . It not likely the world will see similar tactics used in the near or medium term .
 The U.S. and European partners could have achieved their normative goals without unilaterally declaring Ukraine and Georgia inevitable members of Western institutions . Russia has the pretext needed to enflame ethnic conflict, according to the author .
 countries in the post-Soviet space can strengthen their sense of civic pride. This is an area where future Western aid should focus, says Peter Bergen .
 Donetsk and Luhansk Republics and their armed forces are unlikely to willingly lay down their arms . As long as Russian peacekeepers are kept off of Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian government has a chance of avoiding a status quo situation .
 With 89 Western help, this could undermine Russian efforts to appear as the guarantor of economic aid . This could undermine Russia's attempts to appear to be a guarantor.
