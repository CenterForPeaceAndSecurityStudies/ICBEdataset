 This term is often used in public forums without precise understanding of its full meaning, or of the dynamics and risks of the strategy it involves . It is often often used without understanding the full meaning of the term .
 Game theorists rarely carry it to the point of writing down a model that captures the specifics of the crisis, let alone putting any numbers into it that will give us a rough idea of how big that risk of nuclear war was . And while most game theorists have an intuitive understanding of the theory
 We offer here an analytic narrative of the crisis, leading to a model where we can get some numbers out . In the belief that theory should constantly make a better contact with reality, we offer here . We offer . an analytic . narrative .
 A threat is a response rule, and the threatened action inflicts a cost on both the player making the threat and the player whose action the threat is intended to influence . A threat can be a threat to influence a player's actions in order to influence the outcome of the threat .
 If the threat succeeds in its purpose, this action will not actually be carried out . However, if the threat is successful in its intended use, it will be illegal to take action .
 There is no apparent upper limit to the cost of the threatened action, the government says . Therefore, there are no apparent limits to the costs of threatened action .
 The risk of errors is that the threat may fail to achieve its purpose or that the threatened action may occur by accident . But the strategist must use the minimal threat that achieves its purpose .
 You create in advance a probability, but not certainty, that the mutually harmful outcome will happen if the opponent defies you . You create a probability in advance of the outcome, but it's not guaranteed .
 You must arrange in advance to lose control over the realization, while controlling the probability . Therefore, you must arrange for the realization of the realization to be controlled .
 Brinkmanship is the creation and deployment of such a probabilistic threat, it consists of a deliberate and controlled loss of control . Brinksmanship is created and deployed such a threat, the author says . The author says it is a "deliberate and controlled" loss of
 U.S. threat from the United States that compelled the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles is inadequate . Then we argue why a simple explanation is inadequate. We argue that a simple threat from a . simple explanation would be inadequate. The United States threatened to withdraw missiles .
 We build a model of brinkmanship as a dynamic or “real-time” version of chicken, or a war of attrition . Then we solve it numerically to get an idea of the rough magnitudes involved in the conflict .
 Our account draws on several books, including some that were written with the benefit of documents and statements released since the collapse of the Soviet Union . The book is based on documents, statements and statements from Soviet-era documents .
 We cannot hope to do justice to the detail of the detail, let alone the drama, of the events . We will not be able to tell the detail and drama of the event, we say .
 We urge you to read the books that tell the story in vivid detail, and watch movies like Thirteen Days for the drama .
 In late summer and early fall of 1962, the Soviet Union started to place mediumand intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba . The missiles were placed in Cuba by the Soviets in 1962 .
 MRBMs had a range of 1,100 miles and could hit Washington, D.C. IRBMs could hit most of the major U.S. cities and military installations . The IRB Ms. could hit the Pentagon, the Pentagon and most of major cities .
 The missile sites were guarded by the latest Soviet SA-2–type surface-to-air missiles . The missiles could shoot down U.S. highaltitude U-2 reconnaissance planes .
 IL-28 bombers and tactical nuclear weapons called Luna by the Soviets and FROG by the U.S. The weapons could be used against invading troops . They were also used by the Soviet Union and the United States .
 Allison remains important not only for its narrative, but also for its analysis and interpretation . Allison is important to the narrative of the book, but is also important to its interpretation .
 "Our view differs from his in some important respects, but we remain in debt to his insights," he says . "We remain in a debt to him," he adds .
 Had they been successful, it would have increased their offensive capability against the United States manyfold . Had they succeeded, they would have been able to increase their offensive capabilities .
 Their initial placement in Cuba had about 40 MRBMs and IRBMs, which was a substantial increase . They were placed in Cuba by the U.S. military in 2009 .
 The U.S. would still have vast superiority over the Soviet Union in the number of nuclear missiles capable of striking the other side . But the United States would still retain vast superiority in the nuclear arsenal .
 The relative importance of land-based missiles near the U.S. would have decreased . Also, as the Soviets built up their submarine fleet, the relative importance would have been decreased .
 The missiles had more than mere direct military value to the Soviets . But the missiles were more than just military value .
 Successful placement of missiles would have been an immense boost to Soviet prestige throughout the world, especially in Asia and Africa, where superpowers were competing for political and military influence .
 The Soviets had come to think of Cuba as a “poster child” for socialism . Finally, the Soviets had thought of the country as a model for socialism. Cuba was a model of socialism .
 The opportunity to deter a feared U.S. invasion of Cuba and to counter Chinese influence in Cuba weighed importantly in the calculations of the Soviet leader and Premier, Nikita Khrushchev .
 U.S. surveillance of Cuba and of shipping lanes in 1962 indicated some suspicious activity . Cuba had been under surveillance by the United States for months .
 The Soviets denied any intentions to place missiles in Cuba . When questioned about it by U.S. diplomats, the Soviets denied it . The Soviets did not say they had any intentions .
 Later, faced with irrefutable evidence, they said that their intention was defensive, to deter the U.S. from invading Cuba . They later said that they meant to be deterring the United States from invading .
 It is hard to believe this, although we know that an offensive weapon can serve as a defensive deterrent threat . The weapon could be used as a weapon to protect the nation from terrorism .
 U-2 "spy plane" took photographs over western Cuba on Sunday and Monday, October 14 and 15 . They showed unmistakable signs of construction on MRBM launching sites .
 He immediately convened an ad hoc group of top-level advisers, 3 later called the Executive Committee of the National Security Council , to discuss the alternatives .
 He decided to keep the matter totally secret until he was ready to act . If the Soviets knew that the Americans knew, they might speed up the installation and deployment of the missiles . spreading the news without announcing a clear response would create panic .
 To preserve secrecy, the President continued his normal schedule, including travel to speak for Democratic candidates in the midterm congressional elections .
 President Obama dodged press questions abut Cuba and persuaded one or two trusted media owners or editors to preserve the facade of business as usual .
 ExComm had widely differing assessments of the situation and supported different actions . Different members of ExComm supported different approaches to the situation .
 Kennedy pointed out that the first placement, if ignored by the United States, could grow into something much bigger . The Soviets could use the threat of missiles to force the withdrawal of the U.S. and British presence in West Berlin, Kennedy said .
 U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Adlai Stevenson, Dean Acheson and Curtis LeMay consulted with several others . They would consult with the former Secretary of State and the Chief of the United States Air Force .
 Khrushchev thought Kennedy would accept the missile placement as a fait accompli . Khrushchev had hoped Kennedy would have accepted the decision as a decision .
 In all ExComm meetings up to and including the one on the morning of Thursday, October 18, everyone appears to have assumed that the U.S. response would be military .
 The only options discussed seriously were an air strike directed exclusively at missile sites and the SAM sites nearby . A wider air strike including Soviet and Cuban aircraft parked at airfields, and a full-scale invasion of Cuba, were also discussed .
 If anything, attitudes hardened when the evidence of the presence of the longer-range IRBMs arrived . If anything .
 Between October 18 and Saturday, October 20, the majority opinion within ExComm gradually coalesced around the idea of starting with a blockade, issuing an ultimatum with a short deadline, and proceeding to military action if necessary after this deadline expired .
 Military Chiefs of Staff constantly favored a major air strike, but others shifted their views dramatically . Some people held the same positions throughout the discussions .
 President Kennedy’s own positions also shifted away from an air strike toward a blockade . President Kennedy's own positions shifted from air strikes to a blockade of land .
 A weak response would hurt the Democratic party in the imminent congressional elections, says Obama . He was fully aware that a weak response to the situation would hurt his party in Congress, he says .
 In contrast, the responsibility of starting an action that might lead to nuclear war weighed very heavily on him, he said . He said: "In contrast, he was very cautious about starting a nuclear war"
 In the second week of the crisis, his decisions seemed constantly to favor the lowest-key options discussed by ExComm . In the past week, he seemed to favor low-key decisions .
 By the end of the first week’s discussions, the choice lay between a blockade and an air strike . A blockade and air strike would be possible, but the option was not always clear .
 Kennedy made the decision to start by imposing a blockade and announced it in a television address to the nation on Monday, October 22 . Kennedy announced the blockade on October 22 in a televised address .
 He demanded a halt to the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba and a prompt withdrawal of those already there . He also demanded the withdrawal of missiles already in Cuba .
 Kennedy's speech brought the whole drama and tension into the public arena . Kennedy’s speech was the first to be made public in the U.S. and the second to be released .
 Other world leaders and the usual busybodies of international affairs offered advice and mediation . World leaders and other world leaders also offered advice .
 Khrushchev called the blockade “banditry, a folly of international imperialism” and said that his ships would ignore it . Between October 23 and October 25, the Soviets at first tried bluster and denial . The blockade began October 23 .
 The Soviets, in the United Nations and elsewhere, claimed that their intentions were purely defensive and issued statements of defiance . The Soviets claimed that they were only defending themselves .
 Khrushchev to Kennedy sent a message to Kennedy . Kennedy's message included some direct messages from Khrushchevsky to Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 .
 It also included some very indirect and lower-level approaches by the Soviets . The Soviets were also involved in some of the world's most successful anti-war efforts .
 The Soviet Presidium had decided not to let this crisis lead to war . In fact, as early as Monday, October 22, before Kennedy’s TV address, the Presidium was in fact deciding not to go war .
 The missiles in Turkey were obsolete; the United States wanted to remove them anyway . The U.S. wanted to replace them with a Polaris submarine stationed in the Mediterranean Sea .
 Turkey thought to regard presence of U.S. missiles as a matter of prestige . But it was thought it might be difficult to persuade them to accept the change . It was thought that the presence of United States missiles would be seen as prestige .
 The Soviet Presidium ordered the ships carrying the most sensitive materials to stop or turn around . The decision was made by the Presidium of the Soviet Union .
 The United States side saw only that several Soviet ships (which were actually carrying oil and other nonmilitary cargo) continued to sail toward the blockade zone . The U.S. side was only aware of the fact that several ships were carrying oil .
 A tanker was allowed to pass without being boarded; the tramp steamer Marucla carrying industrial cargo was boarded but allowed to proceed after only a cursory inspection . A cargo ship was boarded, but was not boarded .
 Neither side’s actions were as cautious as the top-level politicians on both sides would have liked . But tension was mounting, and tensions were mounting, as well as the tension .
 Khrushchev sent Kennedy a conciliatory private letter offering to withdraw missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba . On the morning of Friday, October 26, the president offered to withdraw the missiles .
 First, the U.S. Navy was not being excessively aggressive in enforcing the blockade . The United States is not being overly aggressive, CNN's John Sutter says .
 It had let through some obviously civilian freighters; they boarded only one ship, the Marucla, and let it pass after a cursory inspection . It was let through by the government .
 Khrushchev sent another letter to Kennedy on Saturday, October 26, offering this swap . This time he made the letter public, and this time it was made public .
 The new letter was presumably a part of the Presidium’s strategy of “looking around” for the best deal . The letter is part of a strategy of "looking around" for best deal.
 The hardening of the Soviet position, as shown by the public “Saturday letter, that followed the conciliatory private “Friday letter,” was another concern . Russia's hardening position is another concern, writes David Frum .
 This discovery showed the Soviet presence there to be vastly greater than thought before, but it also made invasion more dangerous to U.S. troops .
 Cuban anti-aircraft defenses fired at low-level U.S. reconnaissance planes . In addition, Cuba also fired anti-U.S.-Cuban air defenses . The Cuban military says it fired at U.N. reconnaissance aircraft .
 A tough private letter to Khrushchev from President Kennedy was drafted and handed over by Robert Kennedy to the Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin . Robert Kennedy's private letter was drafted by the President of the Soviet Union .
 The U.S. missiles in Turkey will be removed after a few months, but this offer is void if the Soviets mention it in public or link it to the Cuban deal . The offer will be void if it is linked to the deal or mentioned publicly .
 Khrushchev announced that construction of missile sites was being halted immediately and that the missiles already installed would be dismantled and shipped back to the Soviet Union . The missiles were already installed in the United States .
 Kennedy immediately sent a reply welcoming this decision, which was broadcast to Moscow by the Voice of America radio . Kennedy responded by sending a reply to Moscow's decision .
 In fact, the construction activity at the Cuban missile sites continued for a few days .
 The Russians tried to keep IL-28 bombers in Cuba out of the withdrawal . They also tried to stop the withdrawal from Cuba . The Soviet Union tried to prevent the withdrawal of Soviet-made aircraft .
 Inadequacy of Simple Game-Theoretic Explanation of the crisis looks very simple . At first sight, the game theory of this crisis looks simple, but it is not simple .
 The prospect of nuclear annihilation was equally frightening to Kennedy, but that is in the nature of a threat . Kennedy was equally frightened by the prospect of a nuclear war, but it was also frightening to him .
 All that is needed is that the threat be sufficiently costly to induce Khrushchev to act in accordance with Kennedy’s wishes . Then Kennedy doesn’t have to carry out the bad action anyway .
 But a moment’s further thought shows this interpretation to be unsatisfactory, it is unsatisfactory . It is not the first time I've seen this interpretation .
 One might start by asking why the Soviets would deploy the missiles in Cuba at all, when they could look ahead of this unfolding of the subsequent game in which they would come out of the losers .
 They must have thought it possible that the U.S. would accept the missiles as a fait accompli, just as they themselves had accepted United States missiles in Turkey . They must also have thought that the United States would accept them as a result .
 President Kennedy may have appeared weak during his meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna and during the Bay of Pigs episode in 1961 . This belief may have been bolstered by their perception that President Kennedy appeared weak .
 Members of ExComm were never sure about how the Soviets would respond to various U.S. actions . ExComm was never sure how the Soviet Union would respond .
 We have to allow asymmetric information about the other side’s payoffs into a game-theoretic analysis . Thus we have to be able to analyze asymmetric payoffs .
 Several facts about the situation and several events in the course of its unfolding do not fit into the picture of a simple threat . But even more important, several facts are not as simple as the threat, CNN says .
 The idea that a threat has only a lower limit on its size is correct only if the threatener can be absolutely sure that everything will go as planned . As we pointed out before, the idea of a threat only has a smaller limit on size .
 You cannot know your opponent’s value system for sure, and you can't be completely sure that the players’ intended actions will be accurately implemented .
 A U.S. air strike on the missiles or an invasion of Cuba to remove the missiles would have started a sequence of events that would almost surely have culminated in nuclear war between the superpowers . 10 comply, but the threatened action may occur by mistake anyway .
 When such risks exist, the cost of threatened action to oneself becomes an important consideration . The cost of threatening action to one person is important consideration when it comes to one's life .
 Neither side could be sure of the other’s payoffs from the Cold War . The costs of winning or losing the cold war and the costs of a hot war are not known .
 The procedures and details of “blockade” and “air strike” were much more complex than the simple phrases suggest . There were many weak links and random effects between an order in Washington or Moscow and its implementation in the Atlantic Ocean or in Cuba .
 Allison Allison’s excellent book brings out all of these complexities and uncertainties . Allison's excellent book, "Ally Allison's Excellent Book,” is published by Simon Cowell .
 The Cuban missile crisis cannot be explained in game-theoretic terms, he says . They led him to conclude that the missile crisis can't be explained .
 It is not that game theory is inadequate for understanding and explaining the crisis . Crisis was not a two-person game: United States versus USSR, or Kennedy versus Khrushchev . Game theory is not inadequate; rather, it is not a game theory, it says .
 Each of these two “sides” was itself a complex coalition of players with differing objectives, information, actions, and means of communication . Each of the two ‘sides' was itself itself a . complex coalition .
 The players within each side were engaged in other games, and some members were also directly interacting with their counterparts on the other side . Some members of each team were also interacting with each other .
 The crisis can be seen as a complex many-person game with alignments into two broad coalitions . In other words, the crisis can't be viewed as one of many people involved in it .
 Kennedy and Khrushchev can be regarded as the top-level players in this game . Each was subject to constraints of having to deal with others in his own coalition with divergent views . Neither had full control over the actions of these others .
 We argue that this more subtle game-theoretic perspective is not only a good way to look at the crisis, but also essential in understanding how to practice brinkmanship . We argue it is essential to understand how to use brinkmanship.
 Allison emphasizes some items of evidence that Allison emphasizes, as well as others that emerge from other writings . We begin with some of the evidence Allison emphasizes . Allison: "I'm not a believer in the Bible, I'm a believer of the Bible"
 There are several indications of divisions of opinion on each side of the debate . CNN.com's John Sutter reports on the debate in New York City .
 On the United States side, as already noted, there were wide differences between ExComm and ExComm . On the U.S. side, there are wide differences within ExComm.
 Kennedy consulted others such as former President Eisenhower and leading members of Congress . Kennedy found it necessary to consult others such a former President .
 The media and the political opposition would not give the President unquestioning support for too long either . The media would not be giving the President unassailable support too long .
 Kennedy could not have continued on a moderate course if opinion among his advisers and the public became decisively hawkish . Kennedy would have continued to be a moderate, not a hawkish president .
 Individual people also shifted positions in the course of the two weeks . Individual people shifted positions during the two week period .
 Most important, the United States military chiefs always advocated a far more aggressive response . Most important is that the U.S. military chiefs have always advocated an aggressive response.
 Even though Khrushchev was the dictator of the Soviet Union, he was not in full control of the situation . Even though he was dictator, the situation was not as secure as it was at the time .
 There were limits to how far he could count on the Presidium to rubber-stamp his decisions . The Presidium is a powerful body of power in Russia .
 Various parties on the United States side had very different information and a very different understanding of the situation . This led to actions that were inconsistent with the intentions of the leadership or even against their explicit orders .
 The concept of an ‘air strike’ to destroy missiles is a good example . The concept is an example of an air strike to destroy the missiles .
 The nonmilitary people in ExComm thought this would be very narrowly targeted and would not cause significant Cuban or Soviet casualties . But the Air Force intended a much broader attack on Cuba and the Soviet Union . The Air Force wanted a broader attack .
 The U.S. Navy had set procedures for this action, the Navy says . The United States Navy has been criticized for the blockade .
 There was similar lack of information and communication, as well as weakness of the chain of command and control, on the Soviet side . There was also a lack of communication and communication between the Soviet and Russian forces .
 The construction of missiles was left to the standard bureaucratic procedures . For example, the construction of the missiles is left to standard procedures .
 The Soviets used to construction of ICBM sites in their own country where they did not face significant risk of air attack . The Soviets laid out the sites in Cuba in a similar way, where they would have been much more vulnerable to attack .
 The outcome of any decision by the top-level leaders on each side is somewhat unpredictable . All these factors made the outcome of the decision unpredictable .
 A dire threat of waging nuclear war would be too large for Kennedy to tolerate and therefore not credible to compel Khrushchev . The uncertainty can be used to make the threat probabilistic and credible, writes David Perry .
 The risk should be high enough that Khrushchev will comply, but low enough that Kennedy can tolerate it . The risk is not high enough to be a violation of U.S. law, but the risk is low enough to allow it to happen .
 The difficulty in practicing brinkmanship is to control the probability that the threat goes off if the opponent does not comply, experts say . The difficulty is to keep within these lower and upper bounds, the expert says .
 The risks were rapidly rising out of the control of the top leaders on both sides . And in the Cuban missile crisis, the risks were growing out of control .
 Ellsberg was astounded to hear much higher estimates of the probability of war offered by more senior people in ExComm, but later realized that they were correct . Ellsberger: "I'm glad to have been able to get the information out of the system"
 He and other relatively junior participants had not known what extent the top people were losing control of the situation . He said he and others did not know what was happening .
 At numerous points, the people involved might have set off an incident with alarming consequences by taking some action in fear of their own lives . The Navy was trying to get the freighter Marucla to stop and be boarded when it was stopped .
 The firing rule required approval of three officers, only two of whom agreed . Only two of the officers agreed to the rule .
 Third officer may have single-handedly prevented all-out nuclear war . So far, he has saved the lives of millions of people .
 A U-2 plane drifted ‘accidentally’ into Soviet air space and almost caused a serious setback . The plane drifted into Soviet airspace and almost ended up crashing into the Soviet Union .
 General Curtis LeMay ordered the Strategic Air Command’s nuclear bombers to fly past their “turnaround” points and some distance toward Soviet air space . This story became public in a conference held in Havana, Cuba, in October 2002, to mark the 40th anniversary of
 The officer who refused to fire the torpedo was Vasili Arkhipov, who died in 1999 . He was a member of the Soviet submarine crew . The torpedo was fired from a Soviet submarine .
 On the same day an overflying U.S. U-2 plane was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile; a lower-level local commander interpreted his orders more broadly than Moscow had intended 1997, 682).
 Real-time chicken is a game of dynamic or dynamic chicken, also called the war of attrition in game theory literature . Combine this rising risk of disaster with uncertainty about the other’s payoffs, we have a game .
 Instead of the two teenagers of the Chicken "story" driving their cars toward each other while the risk of a collision increases, we have leaders of two major powers testing each other’s resolve . The risk of armageddon increases .
 "The risk of catastrophe increases over time, and cannot be controlled by either party except by conceding" The risk of catastrophes "increase over time," says the author .
 The war of attrition is usually modeled as a game in continuous time (e.g. a game of attrition) Brinkmanship – A Game Of Real-Time Chicken – is a real-time chicken game .
 LeMay is supposed to be the original inspiration, in the 1963 movie Dr. Dr. LeMay . We develop a discrete-time 7 LeMay cigar .
 General Jack D Ripper orders his bomber wing to launch an unprovoked attack on the Soviet Union . Strangelove is for General Jack Ripper, who orders his bombers to attack the USSR .
 The game has thirteen steps, one for each day of the crisis . For overviews and critiques of these, see O’Neill and Zagare .
 With probability the game goes on to step   𝒏 + 𝟏 .11 . In conformity with the evidence, detailed in Section 2, that the players had very poor control over the level of risk at any point, we take these probabilities to be exogenous
 The only endogeneity is whether the players will choose to continue the game to the next higher level of risk . The only other endogeneity in the game is whether it will continue to be played to the highest risk .
 Some control over the probabilities themselves may be worth exploring in future work . But some control of the probabilities may be needed to control the probabilities .
 We assume that the value of winning   𝑾 and the cost of losing   are fixed and common knowledge . We assume   that the value  of winning  and  the cost   is fixed and shared .
 The implied probability that each side is so hard-line is now 𝑳/𝑪max . This will guide our choice of numbers in the numerical solution .
 A player at the soft extreme of the distribution (with a high cost of catastrophe  𝑪 close to 𝚪max ) would concede quickly . A player    near the soft extreme of the distribution would be at the soft extreme . A
 Only those players with 𝑪 in the interval remain, among whom those in the intervals concede . Then at this step only those players who 𝚪 in 𝁪 remain .
 As written, gives a form more useful for the backward iteration needed in our numerical solution . The form is more useful to the reverse iteration needed to solve the problem .
 Given , in the present case is also true, and there is no need to impose it separately . Therefore given , in . the present . case is . also true , and there was no need for imposing it separately. Therefore given, in the . present case was also true .
 Numerical solution of the Cuban missile crisis “game” We solve the above model numerically, using parameter values in the context of the missile crisis .
 This is just a guess, but perhaps reasonable given the magnitude of the catastrophe . It's not just a guessing, but it's a reasonable guess given the severity of the disaster .
 We tried values of 𝑪max ranging from 5 to 20 and the results do not change substantially . The results of  𝎪max range range from 5-20 and    receive a value of  5 to 20 .
 On Sunday October 28, the risk rises to 1,000 because if Khrushchev had not conceded that day, the US invasion plans would have gone into effect . Khruschev's refusal to concede that day would have allowed the invasion to take place .
 For easy reference, we include a brief summary of major events of each day in the second column . The following day's Daily Mail takes a look at the most recent events in the world .
 We experimented with a range of values of Cmax and the other parameters, and found broadly similar results . The third column shows the rising 15 per cent increase in Cmax .
 Readers may wish to conduct their own experiments; that is easy to do using a spreadsheet . Readers may also wish to use a spreadsheet to create their own experiment .
 In column 4 we have the threshold levels of C such that a player with C above it would concede at that stage . The threshold levels are C and C is C, C, or C, and C .
 We emphasize that the numbers we put into the model are guesses, albeit informed by the narration of events . The model is based on the narration, rather than the actual numbers .
 The numbers that emerge in the solution must be regarded as only rough indicators of the reality of the situation, and subject to much discussion and correction . Therefore the numbers that emerged must be considered to be a rough indicator of the real situation .
 First, we see why Khrushchev may have embarked on this adventure at all . We also see why he may not have embarked upon this adventure .
 He clearly put significant value on the prestige that a victory in this confrontation would yield to the USSR (and to him as its leader) in other communist countries, and in many countries of the Western bloc as well .
 It would strengthen his position in other confrontations with the US, especially over Berlin . It would also strengthen his . position .
 He may have had a low C relative to L . Combine this with the likelihood that he thought Kennedy to be weak based on his assessment formed during their meeting in Vienna in 1961 .
 Both sides must have been very hard-line to have lasted as long as they did without conceding . Both sides in fact must have had to be hard-liners to last as long a long as long they did .
 It is possible that both sides underestimated the risk of war for quite a while . However, only the near-collisions that occurred in the last two days of the crisis brought home to them the facts of how far they had lost control of the situation .
 McNamara’s fear as he left the White House that beautiful Fall evening “that might be the last sunset I saw” is understandable . In Column 6, the conditional probability of disaster on the Saturday is high enough that McNamara's fear of disaster was understandable .
 In Column 7, the cumulative probability of disaster over the whole duration of the crisis becomes high enough that we should indeed be thankful that it did not end in a nuclear disaster . And in Column 7 we should be thankful we did not have a nuclear meltdown .
 In the Cuban missile crisis, the very features that make it inaccurate to regard it as a twoperson game make it easier to practice brinkmanship . Brinkmanship is a form of diplomacy in the U.S.
 The blockade was a relatively small action, unlikely to start a nuclear war at once . It is unlikely to be a nuclear bomb at once, but the blockade was unlikely to cause a major nuclear war .
 Kennedy set the blockade in motion, but its operation, escalation, and other features were not totally under his control . "Once Kennedy set it motion, the blockade was not totally controlled," he says .
 He was implicitly saying, “The wheels of the blockade have started to turn and are gathering their own momentum.” ‘The wheels are turning,’ he said. ‘I’m not saying that, but that the wheels have started turning and gathering momentum
 "The longer you defy me, the more likely it is that some operating procedure will slip up," Obama says . "The domestic political pressure will rise to a point where I must give in to the hawks, or some military guy will run amok," he says .
 I may be unable to prevent nuclear war, no matter how much I may regret it at that point . I may not be able to prevent it, even if I regret it, I don't know if I can .
 Khrushchev was making similar implicit statements to Kennedy until he did concede . Kennedy was making such implicit statements before he did admit to defeat .
 We believe that this perspective gives a much better and deeper understanding of the crisis than can most analyses based on simple threats . We believe it gives us a better understanding of what is happening in Syria and beyond .
 It tells us why the risk of war played such an important role in all discussions . The risk of a war is so important that it is important to discuss the risks of war, says David Cameron .
 If you are increasing the level of risk, your opponent does comply, you must be able to “go into reverse” very fast . Begin reducing the risk immediately and quite quickly remove it from the picture .
 If the Soviets feared that Kennedy could not control hawks such as LeMay, they would gain nothing by giving in . The Soviets feared they would lose nothing by refusing to give in .
 To reemphasize and sum up, brinkmanship is the strategy of exposing your rival and yourself to a gradually increasing risk of mutual harm .
 The actual occurrence of the harmful outcome is not totally within the threatener’s control . "The actual occurrence ... not totally ... within the ... control"
 The probability of disaster should remain within certain bounds that make the risk acceptable to the threatener . However, the loss of control must itself be controlled, the risk of disaster must be controlled .
 Cuban missile crisis came close to becoming totally uncontrolled for the two principals . This is difficult to achieve, and in the last couple of days of Cuban crisis the situation was close to being uncontrolled .
 As this process continues, update your estimates of the opponent's payoffs . Update your estimates .
 It appears that in the Cuban missile crisis both sides initially greatly underestimated the opponent’s toughness, and updated their estimates in the light of continued defiance but almost too late .
 Retain enough control over the situation to control the risk of catastrophe – high enough to gain the opponent’s compliance and low enough to be tolerable to you . Retain control of the situation so that it is tolerable .
 Remain alert for signs that the situation is getting out of control, and be ready to reassert control and de-escalate . Be ready for signs of a breakdown .
 In the Cuban crisis Khrushchev’s realization of this came almost too late . It is not clear whether the U.S. leadership ever fully realized it .
