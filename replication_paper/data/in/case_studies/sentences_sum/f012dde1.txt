 Alexandre Debs’ October 6, 2021, will be the first anniversary of the World War II bombing . It will take place in Paris, France, on October 31, 2021 .
 Greater resolve, not greater military capabilities, determines the outcome of crises, says President Obama . "Greater resolve" not greater capabilities, says Obama .
 Critics argue that Washington’s pursuit of nuclear superiority is rational . In fact, critics argue, it is rational to pursue nuclear superiority .
 Despite their spirited attack, these critiques are very narrow- scope . Yet despite their . narrow-reaching attacks, these . critiques are . very narrow . scope .
 Most concede that nuclear weapons have been a force for peace and that they are the ultimate tools of deterrence . Most say nuclear weapons are a tool for peace .
 They do not explain how nuclear compellence could succeed, and how greater nuclear capabilities bolsters it . It does not explain why it would succeed, but how it could succeed .
 TNR scholars themselves were tentative in arguing for the superiority of deterrence . TNR scholar: "Deterrence is the key to deterring"
 For Thomas Schelling, deterrence is easier than compellence if countries know each other's resolve . Schelling: 'Deterrence is easier if countries are aware of each other’s resolve' Schelling says deterrence is better if nations know each others’ resolve .
 But in the real world, uncertainty abounds, and countries do not know each other’s resolve, says CNN.com's John Defterios .
 In that world, Schelling hesitated to proclaim the superiority of deterrence . Schelling: "In that world of deterrence, it would have been impossible to say that."
 Thirty years later, we still have much to learn in understanding how compellence could overcome deterrence . Thirty years after the war, the U.S. still has a lot to learn from the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
 States exchange compellent and deterrent threats, bargain over an issue in dispute, and enter a preemption game . I address this problem in a game-theoretic model where states exchange .
 I show that compellence fails because the coercer would never trigger a nuclear disaster . I show in a baseline set-up that, consistent with TNR, compellences fails . The coercer is never triggered by a nuclear accident .
 I show that compellence may then indeed succeed, and that its success is bolstered by greater military capabilities . I also show that the success is boosted by increased military capabilities, he says .
 "Greater capabilities provide coercive leverage by increasing the risk of disaster," author says . "First-strike capabilities are especially destabilizing," he says .
 TNR was correct to highlight the dangers of pursuing nuclear superiority . TNR has been critical of the U.S. nuclear program .
 Proof of the formal results and discussion of coding rules are contained in the Appendices . The results of the coding experiment are published in this article .
 They are the ultimate instruments of deterrence, the weapon of the weak, says President Obama . They are also the ultimate weapons of deterrence .
 In the pre-nuclear age, conventional superiority could produce military victory . But conventional superiority was not always possible in the U.S.
 In the nuclear age, the prospect of a nuclear attack acts as a powerful deterrent . The prospect of an attack on the U.S. is an important part of the nuclear arsenal .
 A critique of TNR could question whether its implications are correct and whether it outlines the right mechanism generating the predictions .
 Recent critiques accept that nuclear weapons have encouraged peace between great powers . Most recent critiques accept nuclear weapons encourage peace between nations .
 The prediction of peace is “difficult to evaluate” because there could be alternative explanations, Green says . Green is more skeptical, but he only goes so far as saying that “the prediction . of peace” is ‘difficult” to evaluate .
 Recent critiques do little to challenge TNR’s prediction that nuclear weapons are the ultimate tools of deterrence and help enforce the status quo . TNR: Nuclear weapons are a tool of deterrence that helps enforce status quo in the United States .
 They “are uniquely deterring because they appear to make victory in war impossible’s ‘unprecedented’ They are ‘uniquely deterring’ because they ‘appear to make victories impossible,’ says historian John MacArthur .
 Kennedy then announced a blockade, a classic example of a probabilistic threat, and he succeeding in compelling the Soviets to withdraw from Cuba . Kennedy then followed by compelling the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba, he says .
 Sechser and Fuhrmann do not show that deterrence is easier than compellence, they say . They say deterrence is not always easy to achieve, but it is easier to do it .
 Sechser suggests 7. It is important to establish whether and how compellent threats could prevail in the world's most powerful state of power . It is also important to determine if and how the threat could prevail .
 If deterrence is stable, then TNR’s main implications, on peace between great powers and the preservation of the status quo, will endure . TNR's main implications will endure, writes Andrew Hammond .
 Once states exchange these threats, they may worry about rapid escalation . The U.S. may worry that rapid escalation may be possible .
 Recent work has made progress in understanding crisis preemption games, but debates remain . Recent work in understanding of crisis pre-emption games has been made progress .
 Powell (1990, Chapter 5) concluded that peace would prevail, if any country could end the crisis . Powell concluded in 1990 that peace will prevail if any nation could end it . Powell: Peace would prevail .
 It is not clear, though, that there is then “no “fundamental” basis for an attack by either side,” or that this set-up captures the strategic outlook of states facing a nuclear disaster .
 Peace prevails when first-strike advantages are small, Fearon says . Fearon adds that if countries receive a warning, even imperfect, of their enemy’s action, then peace prevails .
 None of these models allows that compellence may be slightly less effective than deterrence, as documented by other datasets . None of the models allow that compeelence may not be slightly more effective .
 Study finds 41.4% of Americans support strategic selection, crisis bargaining, and the exchange of compellent and deterrent threats . Yet the difference is small (41.4%) and the “conclusion is only tentative,” given concerns over selection effects and confounding factors .
 TNR’s most important prediction peace between great powers and the main mechanism generating this prediction nuclear weapons are the ultimate tools of deterrence . They concede TNR's most important peace is between the two great powers .
 Their critique really centers on Jervis (1989, Chapter 1)’s fifth implication that there is a link between the military balance and political outcomes . Their critique is that there should be a link to military balance, political outcomes.
 The fact that nuclear weapons are the ultimate tools of deterrence does not mean that strategic territory and alliances are worthless . Nuclear weapons are a tool of deterrence, not strategic territory or alliances, it is said .
 Great powers continue to have interests even if they possess nuclear weapons . Great powers still have interests, even though they have nuclear weapons, says CNN.com editor .
 Lieber and Press’s most powerful critique argues for a link between the military balance and political outcomes . Lieber argues that the balance of the military and political power can be found in the U.S.
 Lieber and Press do not offer any evidence of such a link, they say . They offer very little evidence of policymakers’ 10 strategic outlook, and offer little evidence .
 Technology analyses show that the U.S. was close to acquiring a first-strike capability, but this does not prove that policymakers intended to build such a capability, or that greater military capabilities improved coercive leverage .
 TNR actually provides valuable insights for understanding the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority . TNR offers valuable insights to understanding the United States' nuclear ambitions .
 Policymakers may choose policies that appear sensible, but are in fact inefficient, even dangerous . Trapped by previous discourse on the essential features of competent nuclear management, policymakers may choose such policies .
 Jervis did not spell out how this insight captures the evolution of U.S. nuclear strategy, it may easily be discounted, but it is actually powerful .
 The French invoked this logic to justify their own force de frappe . Soon after, the French invoked it to justify themselves .
 The problem for Washington is that it risked entrapment by a small, autonomous nuclear arsenal, as Moscow developed its ICBM capabilities . Moscow has developed its own ICBM capability . The problem is that Washington is not ready to deal with Russia's small nuclear arsenal .
 Flexible response could reduce the risk of entrapment, pressing for the centralization of nuclear decisions . It could shift some of the burden for conventional defense onto U.S. allies .
 Kennedy campaigned on the dangers of a missile gap, believing at the time that the Soviets were ahead . Kennedy had campaigned for the safety of missile gaps .
 The administration learned that the reverse was true, and could now boast of its superiority . After learning that, the administration could . now boast that, it could .
 U.S. nuclear superiority could again trap United States officials . Yet discussions of nuclear superiority are still a problem .
 United States officials continued to speak of nuclear superiority, but downplayed its importance . They devised a criterion for effective deterrence assured destruction which did not rely on the nuclear balance .
 Each side has enough nuclear forces virtually to eliminate the other’s urban society in a second strike . The utility of extra nuclear forces is dubious at best at best, the author says .
 By the time Nixon took office, the end of United States nuclear superiority appeared imminent . The end of U.S. nuclear superiority was imminent .
 This objective was vague, seemingly consistent with assured destruction while allowing future flexibility . This objective is seemingly consistent, seemingly . While vague, it seems consistent, it allows future flexibility and flexibility . The objective is vague and seemingly consistent .
 In the short run, Washington’s policies would be measured against previous standards . But in the long run, they would have to be measured by previous standards, he says .
 The SALT accords enshrined Soviet quantitative superiority . Ultimately, the accords were enshrined by the SALT Protocol .
 We haven't developed a new missile for 15 years and they have three new ones. We haven’t developed new missile since 2002, says President Obama .
 The elusive evaluation of nuclear strategy also complicated U.S. relations with the Soviet Union . The Soviets were also involved in the development of nuclear weapons .
 Washington’s subsequent move to counterforce didn’t square with a commitment to sufficiency . In this context, the move didn't square with the commitment of sufficiency, says John Avlon .
 In early 1983, Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov warned Warsaw Pact leaders that “the new round of the arms race, imposed by the USA, has major, qualitative differences ... in creating modified missile systems, do not hide the that they are really intended for a future war .
 In sum, TNR offers a compelling logic for understanding the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority .
 Nuclear superiority does not necessarily advance U.S. security, even if it does not advance United States security . But policymakers may be trapped by previous discourse and changing circumstances .
 According to the standard narrative, the logic of TNR dominated U.S. policymaking until the turn to counterforce in the mid-1970s . The standard narrative is that TNR's logic of the 1970s dominated policymaking .
 President Nixon adopted the logic of TNR in pursuing arms control agreements with the Soviet Union . President Nixon had adopted the same logic in pursuing such agreements .
 Throughout the 1969-1979 period, U.S. policymakers did not believe in TNR, and competed aggressively with the Soviet Union in nuclear acquisition, employment, and arms control policy .
 Whether and how it does so depends on its “comparative constitutional fitness” on competitive and cooperative dimensions . The U.S. should be able to compete with other nations in the world, the president says .
 The competitive dimensions are resource production, which favors intense competition, resource extraction, and resource direction, which permits technological innovation . Resource extraction favors high quantitative targets; resource direction allows technological innovation.
 The cooperative dimensions are efficiency at distributional bargaining, which bolsters diplomatic negotiations . Enforcement, which helps ensure the enemy’s compliance, is the other dimension of cooperation .
 When a state has an advantage in all competitive tasks, it does not pursue an arms control agreement . State does not want arms control agreements when it has a strong advantage in competitive tasks . Arms control agreement is not a solution for arms control .
 When it has an advantage in all cooperative tasks, it pursues an arms control agreement favoring qualitative stability . The U.S. pursues arms control agreements favoring " qualitative stability" in Syria .
 This general theory explains U.S. nuclear policy between 1969 and 1979, Green contends . Green contends, when it agreed to quantitative limitations while pursuing qualitative advantages, it was the case .
 Its great potential, innovative industries, and productive civil-military relations supported resource production and direction . Its great economic potential and innovative industries provided resource production, direction .
 Its political institutions and ideology undermined distribution of bargaining and enforcement, it says . The government's political institutions undermined distributional bargaining, enforcement .
 Liberal ideology 17 bound the country to international agreements, irrespective of its terms or the enemy’s compliance . Liberal ideology binds the U.S. to the terms of an international agreement .
 Green’s theory is complex and the evidence is very rich, analyzing well over 20,000 pages of declassified documents . Green: The evidence is rich and complex .
 This close engagement with the qualitative evidence generates two important contributions to the study . The study was published by the University of Cambridge, England .
 TNR, as I argue above, can explain how policymakers may feel trapped by previous discourse on competent nuclear management .
 It's helpful to document how they justified their policy privately . Still, it's helpful that they justified it privately, says CNN.com .
 Second, Green highlights the fluidity of policymakers’ assessment of the nuclear balance . Green: “The balance is fluid’s fluidity,” says Green. “It is fluidity that policymakers are able to make a decision on nuclear power .
 Even with large nuclear arsenals, states may worry about losing their retaliatory capabilities . States may worry that they may be losing their capabilities .
 Between 1969 and 1974, Washington went from confidence that neither side could obtain a first strike, to confidence that it was alone in possessing it . Washington was concerned that Moscow may have such a capability .
 Packard thus explained in March 1970, “we must then rely increasingly on the Polaris.”
 Despite these important contributions, the book fares better in explaining how nuclear power would compete than whether and why it does . The book also fails to explain how and why nuclear power can compete, rather than how it does.
 If they correctly predict the arms control agreements of 1969-1979, they fail to predict the absence of such agreements in 1959-1969 . The U.S. arsenal more than doubled in the years before the agreement was reached .
 Green 19 ’s theory does not spell out how state preferences aggregate into arms control agreements . Moreover, Green . 19 ‘s theory doesn’t explain how state . preferences aggregate . into arms . control agreements, Green 19 says .
 A state may also need to trade restrictions in areas of strength to obtain restrictions on areas of weakness . State may also trade restrictions for restrictions in weakness to get restrictions on weakness .
 U.S. policymakers had the advantage in ABM technology and cruise missiles, the author says . The United States also had a big advantage in the ABM and cruise missile technology .
 They traded concessions on ABM technology for limits on quantitative competition . But they pressed unsuccessfully for an agreement condoning competition on cruise missiles . The U.S. and Russia are the only two countries in the world to have agreed a deal .
 TNR offers a more compelling explanation of the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority .
 Green downplays TNR’s explanation as focused on “irrational” or “parochial” interests . Green says TNR's explanation isn't focused on irrational interests .
 TNR explains how rational policymakers would pursue superiority, even if it does not serve the U.S. national security interest .
 Whether superiority does serve U.S. national security is the crux of the matter, which Green ‘says does not elucidate .
 It's helpful to document that U.S. policymakers turned against it sooner . It's certainly helpful to . document that . United States policymakers turned . against it .
 As we argued above, TNR has a compelling explanation for the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority . Concerns for reassuring allies also play a central role .
 The fact that nuclear weapons are the ultimate tools of deterrence does not mean 8 Gavin ‘’s historiography is also confusing,’ says Gavin . ‘8 Gavin ’s history of the Cold War is confusing, he says .
 Gavin 21 says U.S. should view nuclear proliferation favorably . Gavin 21 said the United States should view nukes proliferation favorably. Gavin 21: The U.N. shouldn't be worried about nuclear proliferation . Gavin says the U.K. should be wary of nuclear weapons proliferation .
 Suggesting that nonproliferation has always been a first priority would be incorrect . Suggesting it was always a priority is incorrect, suggests the U.S. should always be first priority .
 Gavin ‘’s broad generalizations obscure the role that history would play in informing debates on nuclear politics. Gavin ’s . ‘I’m sure history would help us understand the role it has in informing our nuclear politics,’ he writes . Gavin �
 Gavin's review of the book was published some six and eight years earlier . Gavin refrains from doing so, instead copying his prior reviews, published some 6 and 8 years ago .
 When presenting MIDAR theory, Gavin does not discuss any primary evidence . Gavin calls the theory “a heuristic framework” which “does not fully capture the nuance and context of the history of U.S. nuclear statecraft .
 TNR and Gavin agree on the importance of allied considerations in the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority . In sum, TNR's Gavin agrees on the issue .
 Whether and how military capabilities truly coerce enemies, however, remains an open question . Whether or not military capabilities can be used to coerce foes is still a mystery .
 In his view, U.S. officials believed in nuclear superiority, which did offer coercive benefits, he said . In his opinion, the U.N. had a coercive advantage .
 Statistical tests show that larger arsenals are associated with more favorable crisis outcomes . The U.S. has a larger arsenal of weapons than any other nation's .
 Kroenig’s “superiority-brinkmanship” theory is based on his theory . He says it provides bargaining leverage for the U.S. to negotiate with Russia .
 The fact that larger arsenals inflict greater damage is not surprising, but it's not surprising . "Larger arsenals inflicted greater damage than smaller ones," says CNN's John Sutter .
 What remains to be shown is whether the resulting differences are politically and diplomatically meaningful . What remains is left to be seen is whether it will be politically and politically meaningful .
 With fewer U.S. nuclear weapons to destroy, Russia could hurl more missiles at United States cities . With fewer United States nuclear weapons, fewer missiles are available to destroy .
 In a conflict with North Korea, Kroenig argues, the continental U.S. would be spared a nuclear disaster . North Korea has a long history of nuclear testing .
 Kroenig: “There’s no military solution here, they got us” . Assessing his own work, he highlights its quantitative evidence but its qualitative evidence and theoretical argument .
 The theory was the “biggest contribution” of a 2013 article, a precursor to the book . The correlation between the nuclear balance and crisis outcomes should be taken with caution, given the small number of crises .
 U.S. policymakers seemed to believe in nuclear superiority in their turn to counterforce in the mid-1970s . Green’s evidence suggests that the transition may have begun sooner .
 Qualitative evidence that U.S. policymakers believed in nuclear superiority in actual crises would be valuable . Evidence that such beliefs explained their policy choices would be useful .
 Kroenig misrepresents the views of key officials, does not engage with evidence contradicting his view, and does not provide any new evidence to adjudicate between competing interpretations . Unfortunately, he doesn't provide new evidence for a new interpretation .
 Key U.S. officials, including McNamara and President Kennedy, did not attribute success in the crisis to their nuclear superiority .
 McNamara did not “take into account” the nuclear balance of power and “explicitly link it’s” to policy recommendations about crisis escalation, he says . McNamara didn’t take into account the balance, he adds .
 He recommended restraint, based solely on the risk of nuclear disaster . He said restraint was based on the risks of a nuclear accident .
 For critical reviews, see,g., Glaser ; Sechser . 27 above, describes the inescapable mathematical fact that casualties increase .
 McNamara did not believe that superiority should instruct policy choices . McNamara said superiority should not instruct policy makers to make decisions .
 Dillon himself recognized as much as much, in the very statement quoted by Kroenig . Dillon himself was quoted as much in the statement .
 McNamara declared that “nuclear weapons serve no military purpose whatsoever” McNamara indeed declared that nuclear weapons serve “no military purpose”
 They are totally useless, except to deter one’s opponent from using them . They are useless to deter opponents, except for deterring them from doing so .
 The Cuban missile crisis illustrates the insignificance of nuclear superiority in the face of survivable thermonuclear retaliatory forces . The Cuban crisis illustrates not the significance but the insignibility of the nuclear superiority, the author says .
 Early in the crisis, hawks pressed for an attack on Cuba . They were convinced that U.S. nuclear superiority would deter Soviet escalation .
 President Kennedy’s handling of the crisis appears more consistent with TNR than with superiority-brinkmanship theory . TNR: Kennedy handled the crisis in a similar way to TNR .
 Kroenig says his argument is "simply standard bargaining theory" He says earlier proponents of the theory embraced it . The argument is a classic example of bargaining theory .
 Nitze argued that it was “a copybook principle in strategy that, in actual war, advantage tends to go to the side in a better position to raise the stakes by expanding the scope, duration or intensity of the conflict, he said . Nitze: "In actual war

 Kroenig's contribution is to reinterpret the variables of Powell's model, assume that military capabilities factor into a country’s resolve, so that they affect diplomatic outcomes, he says .
 In the game of Chicken, the stronger power does not necessarily prevail . The stronger power doesn't necessarily prevail in the game, says the author .

 A more favorable nuclear balance reduces a country’s concerns for standing firm, experts say . More favorable nuclear balances reduces concerns for a country standing firm . A favorable balance reduces the concerns of standing firm.
 This risk of inadvertent war, it turns out, may allow the weaker power to prevail in the risk dominant equilibrium . The weaker power may be able to prevail against the risk of war .
 Assume that disaster strikes with probability  𝑓 > 0 if only one country stands firm . Assume    disease will strike with probability that only one nation stands firm. Assume that disaster strikes only if only a single country is standing firm

 The weaker nuclear power does fear the harsh consequences of a nuclear exchange . It is not the only nuclear power in the world to fear a nuclear war .
 Nuclear threats are effective only if assurances are credible . Such is a key feature of brinkmanship crises . Nuclear threats can only be effective if they are credible assurances .
 While Kroenig is thought provoking, it misses important nuances of nuclear dynamics, it does little to explain whether and how nuclear superiority promotes national security . In short, the author says .
 Critics argue that TNR should be abandoned, yet they consent that nuclear weapons have been a force for peace . The ultimate tools of deterrence, they say, are the ultimate tools for deterrence .
 They do not establish how compellence could overcome deterrence, or how military capabilities correlate with diplomatic success, they say . It is not clear how compeelence can overcome deterrence .
 Nuclear threats never succeeded when triggering a crisis and often succeeded in enforcing the status quo . Nuclear threats failed to trigger a crisis, but often succeeded to enforce the current status quo, experts say .
 This evidence could support TNR’s claim about the effectiveness of deterrence . TNR: This evidence supports our claim that deterrence works .
 TNR would caution that the status quo may be ambiguous, that countries could successfully compel, by attempting to do so despite its cost, given uncertainty about countries’ resolve and strategic selection into crises .
 Country 1 decides whether to issue a compellent threat, requesting revisions to the status quo . Country 1 then decides whether or not to issue the threat . It is the first time a threat has been issued by a member of the U.S. government .
 Country 2 decides whether to accept country 1’s demand or to issue a deterrent threat, hoping to enforce the status quo . Country 2 will decide if to accept the demand or issue a threat to enforce status quo.
 Country 1 decides whether to back down, accepting the status quo, or to stand firm, triggering a preemption game . Country 1 will decide whether to stand down or back down in the fight .
 The paper lets country 1 use any of the standard techniques bolstering the credibility of threats . Then the country 1 can use the other country's standard techniques to bolster its credibility . The paper is published in the U.S.
 If country 1 burns bridges, i.e. if it commits to attack after country 2’s rejection, then compellence is more effective than deterrence . If country . 1 burned bridges, if it committed to attack, then it would be more likely to do so . compe

 Under some conditions, all types pool on the same, relatively generous offer . Under some circumstances, all kinds pool on same generous offer of money .
 A more favorable nuclear balance improves a country’s peaceful terms without increasing the risk of disaster, author says . Next, he concludes that a more favorable nuke balance improves the peace of a country's peaceful terms . The author concludes that such a balance improves peace without increasing risk of
 Greater first-strike capabilities may improve peace terms, but only under a heightened risk of nuclear disaster . Greater first strike capability may improve peaceful terms, however, with greater risk of disaster .
 They make even more aggressive offers, tolerating a greater risk of war . The U.S. is willing to tolerate the risk, even if it risks war, it says .
 They exchange compellent and deterrent before entering crisis preemption game, with reciprocal fear of surprise attack . The two nations exchange a game of deterrence and preemption before entering a crisis game .
 Country 1 chooses whether to trigger a crisis to revise the status quo . Country 1 chose between a crisis and a decision to revise status quo. Country 1 decides to trigger the crisis and change the situation .
 If it does not, country 1 can back down, accepting the status quo after all, giving country 𝑖 a payoff of 𝜋𝖖 . Or stand firm, triggering a preemption game . If country   𝓖 does not stand firm
 In the crisis preemption game, both countries simultaneously choose whether to attack . Both countries choose not to attack in a crisis preempt game .
 Countries fear being the target of a surprise attack, and may prefer to attack if they expect their enemy to do so . Still, countries fear being a target of surprise attack .
 We solve this game for a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, where strategies 37 are optimal given beliefs and the strategies of other players . Beliefs are consistent with Bayes’ rule whenever possible .
 We evaluate effectiveness of “compellent” and “deterrent” threats . We evaluate the relative effectiveness of each threat .
 A compellent threat is issued when country 1 triggers a crisis to revise the status quo . The threat has been issued when the situation becomes a crisis in the country .
 A deterrent threat is issued when country 2 rejects country 1’s offer and attempts to enforce the status quo . The threat is a deterrent threat when a country 2 reject the offer and attempt to enforce status quo.
 We evaluate the impact of military capabilities on the terms of peace and the odds of war . We also evaluate the effect of military . capabilities on terms of . peace and odds of . war, through their effect on nuclear balance and firststrike advantages .
 It is not sequentially rational for country 1 to stand firm if the preemption game produces war with positive probability . There is no equilibrium where a peaceful revision of the status quo occurs with positive . probability .
 These results confirm TNR’s intuition about the challenges of compellence .
 Country 1 could successfully coerce if it lacked the option of backing down after country 2’s rejection or if it convinced country 2 that it prefers war to a dishonorable peace . Country 1 may have the option to back down after the rejection of the proposal .
 By burning bridges, country 1 ensures that any rejection by country 2 triggers a nuclear disaster . The world's first nuclear power station is located in South Korea . The country's second nuclear reactor in the region was built in the 1970s .
 A more aggressive offer generates a more favorable peace, but it is more likely to be rejected . A 'more aggressive offer' generates a better peace than a 'more favorable peace' offer .
 The more country 1 is willing to run the risk of nuclear disaster, the more favorable are the terms of peace . Consistent with TNR, TNR says the more risk of a nuclear disaster is likely to be greater .
 In contrast with TNR, however, the more resolved a state is, the least likely it is to succeed . TNR: In contrast, the most resolved state is less likely to succeed.
 A greater display of resolve could coerce only if it corresponded with a greater risk of war after rejection . But by burning bridges, country 1 ensures that war follows any rejection . The U.S. should not burn bridges, it would have been a mistake .
 The more resolved a state is, the more willing it is to run the risk of war, experts say . The more resolution a state has, it will be more willing to risk war, they say .
 It chooses a more aggressive offer, which is more likely to be rejected . It chooses the more aggressive approach, which will be rejected by the government .
 A more favorable nuclear balance increases country 1’s war payoff at the expense of country 2 . A better balance increases the risk of a war against the other country .
 Country 1’s first-strike capabilities, for their part, matter only if country 2 would not attack, knowing that country 1 would, or only if . country 2 is a strategy dominant dove. Country 1's first strike capabilities matter only to country 2 .
 These types accept the lowest offers, made by the most hostile types of country . The most hostile type of country accepts the lowest offer made by most of the world's countries .
 It serves as a useful benchmark for probabilistic threats, which we turn to next week . Nevertheless, it serves as useful benchmark .
 This model stands as a middle ground between the previous two, approximating the baseline model as 𝜖 approaches 0 and the model of burning bridges as    approaches 1 . This model is a middle-ground between the two models .
 Whenever policymakers deploy military power, officers assess proximate threats and decide whether to take actions that could quickly escalate . The U.S. has a history of using military force in the Middle East and beyond .
 The greater is the risk of disaster (the closer  𝜖 is to 1) The more probabilistic threats resemble burning bridges, making compellence more effective, and increasing the concessions obtained by country 1 .
 If condition holds, assume that condition holds for all ℎ2 , and conditions and hold. Otherwise, assume  condition holds .
 We ask whether a ‘rational’ type, which would not trigger nuclear war, can extract concessions by appearing irrational . We ask if a “rational” type, not a nuclear war would trigger war, is a rational type .
 All types pool on the same offer, which is accepted by country 2 . In this equilibrium, all types pool pool on same offer and accepted by countries 2 .
 Compellence succeeds, not because it signals anything about country 1’s willingness to fight, but precisely because it does not . Compellences succeeds because it doesn’t signal anything about the country 1, but does not. It does not signal anything .
 Country 2 cannot discern whether it faces a bluffing rational type or an irrational type, which would prefer to trigger a nuclear war . Country 2 can't discern if it faces the bluffing irrational type or the irrational type of the enemy .
 To sustain this equilibrium, ‘‘ country 2 cannot be too bellicose , so that it accepts significant concessions, and country 1’s most bellicoses preferences must be intermediate . The threat of its irrationality is effective, but it is willing to accept peaceful concessions
 As the nuclear balance becomes more favorable to country 1, it enjoys more favorable peaceful terms and the probability of war remains unchanged . Result: As country 1’s first-strike capabilities improve, it affects neither the terms of peace nor the likelihood of war . Result 2 If country 1
 As before, the nuclear balance may safely improve country 1’s diplomatic outcome . The nuclear balance could safely improve the diplomatic outcome of the nuclear war .
 Country 1’s first strike capabilities have no effect because its offer targets the most resolved type of country 2, which would fight in the preemption game, denying country 1 the possibility of striking first .
 Recent critiques are quite narrow, generally accepting that nuclear weapons have been a force for peace and that they are the ultimate tools of deterrence . Recent critiques have been quite narrow . They say nuclear weapons are a tool of deterrence and are necessary for peace .
 They mainly focus on the U.S. drive for nuclear superiority, arguing that it was rational and there is a link between military capabilities and political outcomes . They argue that there are links between capabilities and outcomes .
 They do little to explain how nuclear weapons compel, and how greater military capabilities provide coercive leverage . Yet they do little .
 The fact that U.S. policymakers pursued nuclear superiority does not mean that it served national security interests, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: "The fact that United States. policymakers pursue nuclear superiority doesn't mean it served United States national security .
 TNR offers a compelling explanation for the U.S. pursuit for nuclear superiority . Policymakers may be trapped by previous discourse on competent nuclear management, TNR says .
 This paper shows that compellence may ovecome deterrence once we account for strategic selection into crises, and allow coercers to use standard techniques to bolster the credibility of their threats .
 It shows that improved coercion may come at the cost of an increased risk of nuclear disaster . At the same time, it shows that better coercion comes at the risk of a disaster .
 If TNR scholars were too sanguine about the stability of MAD, they were right to raise the alarm in the late 1970s and 1980s . Washington came close to escaping the nuclear stalemate .
