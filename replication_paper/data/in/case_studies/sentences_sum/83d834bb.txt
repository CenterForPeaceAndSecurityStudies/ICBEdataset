 The United States president elected to transmit this sensitive message through his brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, who met in his office at the Justice Department with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin .
 The meeting has long been recognized as a turning point in the crisis, but several aspects of it have been shrouded in mystery and confusion . Several aspects of the meeting have been obscured in the past .
 U.S. officials maintained that neither John nor Robert Kennedy promised to withdraw the Jupiters as a quid pro quo, or concession, in exchange for the removal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba, or as part of an explicit agreement, deal, or pledge .
 Thirteen Days depicted RFK as rejecting any firm agreement to withdraw the Jupiters . This was also the first public indication that the issue had even been privately discussed . RFK rejected the idea that he had agreed to withdraw them .
 The first authoritative admission on the U.S. side that the Jupiters had actually been part of a ""deal"" came at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 .
 Former Kennedy speechwriter Theodore Sorensen edited out a reference to the inclusion of the Jupiters in the final deal to settle the crisis . The former speechwriter admitted, after prodding from Dobrynin, he edited out the reference .
 Dobrynin's original, contemporaneous, and dramatic cable of the meeting has been declassified and is available at the archives of the Russian Foreign Ministry . The cable was alluded to in some accounts by Soviets, such as Anatoly Gromyko .
 It is reprinted in translation below, along with relevant excerpts from the other publications mentioned above . The book is published in the United States and Canada .
 Dobrynin cable's first publication in English, a copy obtained by the Japanese television network NHK, came last year in an appendix to We AII Lost the Cold War, a study by Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Stein .
 I told him first that we knew that work was continuing on the missile bases in Cuba and that in the last few days it had been expedited . I said he told him that the work was expedited, and that it was continuing in Cuba .
 I said that in the last few hours we had learned that our reconnaissance planes flying over Cuba had been fired upon . One of our U-2s had been shot down and the pilot killed, he said .
 He had done everything possible to avoid a military engagement with Cuba and with the Soviet Union . But now they had forced our hand, he says .
 If the Cubans or Soviets shot at these planes, then we would have to shoot back . "Because of the deception of the Soviet Union, our photographic reconnaissance planes would continue to fly over Cuba," he says .
 This would inevitably lead to further incidents and to escalation of the conflict, the implications of which are very grave indeed . The implications of this would be very grave, says the British Foreign Secretary .
 He said the Cubans resented the fact that we were violating Cuban air space . He said he said the Cuban government resented that they were violating air space.
 If we had not violated Cuban air space, we would still believe Khrushchev had said there would be no missiles placed in Cuba, he said . I replied that if we hadn't violated Cuba air space we would have continued to believe what he had said, he added .
 "This matter was far more serious than the air space of CubaÂ—it involved the peoples of both of our countries and, in fact, people all over the globe," President Obama said .
 We had to have a commitment by tomorrow that those bases would be removed . The bases had to be removed by the end of the day .
 He should understand that if they did not remove those bases, we would remove them, says CNN.com.com . "We would remove the bases," he says .
 President Kennedy had great respect for the Ambassador's country and the courage of its people . President Kennedy was proud of his country and its courage .
 President Obama's response to Russia's attack on Syria would be a disaster, but before that was over, there would be dead Americans and dead Russians as well . The U.S. might feel it necessary to take retaliatory action, but it's not necessary, he says .
 President Kennedy had been anxious to remove missiles from Italy and Turkey for a long period of time . However, he said, President Kennedy was anxious to . remove those missiles . The missiles were removed from Italy, Turkey and Italy in 1960s .
 He had ordered their removal some time ago, and it was our judgment that, within a short time after this crisis, those missiles would be gone, he said . He said the missiles were ordered by President Obama .
 I said President Kennedy wished to have peaceful relations between our two countries . I said he wished for peaceful relations with the U.S. President Kennedy .
 He wished to resolve the problems that confronted us in Europe and Southeast Asia, he said . He said: "I wish to resolve problems that faced us in Asia and Europe"
 "We could make progress only when the crisis is behind us," he said . "We can make progress on these matters only when we are behind us"
 President is sitting down to write a message to Chairman Khrushchev, writes David Frum . "Probably at this very moment the President is writing a message," he says .
 We want to ask you, Mr Dobrynin, to pass President Kennedy's message to Chairman Khrushchev through unofficial channels . We want you to pass the message to the Chairman of the Soviet Union .
 President Kennedy implores Chairman Khrushchev to accept his offer and to take into consideration the peculiarities of the American system . President Kennedy: "President Kennedy would rather rather than accept the offer"
 Ambassador Dobrynin felt that Robert Kennedy's book did not adequately express that the ""deal"" on the Turkish missiles was part of the resolution of the crisis . Ambassador Dobynin said that the deal was not enough to be discussed in the book . Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 .
 The Ambassador is justified in saying that the diaries are not as explicit as his conversation . So I took it upon myself to edit that out of his diaries, and that is why the Ambassador is somewhat justified in .
 Kennedy instructed his brother to tell Ambassador Dobrynin that while there could be no bargain over the missiles that had been supplied to Turkey, the president himself was determined to have them removed . The president would attend to the matter once the crisis was resolved, as long as no one in Moscow
 We agreed without hesitation that no one not in the room was to be informed of this additional message . We were aware of the cost of a public bargain struck under pressure at the apparent expense of the Turks, the Turks .
 As far as I know, none of the nine of us told anyone else what had happened . "We didn't tell anyone else," she says .
 Bobby Kennedy told Ambassador Dobrynin that if the missile were not withdrawn immediately, the crisis would move into a different and dangerous military phase . Earlier in the week Bobby Kennedy said if the crisis were not resolved immediately, it would move to a different military phase, he said .
 Robert Kennedy told Dobrynin that the military might take over . In his book Khrushchev Remembers he states that Robert Kennedy said he might take control of the country . Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 .
 Khrushchev either genuinely misunderstood or deliberately misused Bobby's statement . Bobby's comments were either genuine or deliberate misunderstood .
 "Obviously there was never any threat of a military takeover in this country," says President Obama . "There were never any threats of military takeover," he says .
 In response to Khrushchev's letter, Kennedy suggested informing Russians of Turkey's Jupiters in Turkey . Kennedy: "We should inform Russians of this so that this irrelevant question would not complicate the solution of missile sites in Cuba"
 I telephoned Bobby to underline that he should pass this along to Dobrynin only as information, not a public pledge . Shortly after we returned to our offices, I telepeded Bobby to tell him to pass it along .
 Bobby told me that he was then sitting with Dobrynin and had already talked with him . Bobby said that he told him that he had talked with Dobynin and that he would talk with him again .
 R Kennedy said he realized that he had different approaches to solving the problems . Kennedy said that he realized he and Kennedy would not be able to convince each other . Kennedy: "We have different approaches and it's not likely that we could convince ourselves"
 The cable testifies to the concern of John and Robert Kennedy that military action would trigger runaway escalation . The cable also testifies that the Kennedy brothers were concerned about the possibility of military action .
 Such an admission seems illogical if the U.S. was using the threat of force to compel the Soviet Union to withdraw its missiles from Cuba . Such a move would have been illogical in the context of the Cuban crisis .
 It significantly raised the expected cost to the United States of an attack against the missiles, thereby weakening the credibility of the American threat . The U.S. is expected to be at risk of being attacked by Iran .
 Kennedy would have had to discount the possibility of Soviet retaliation to Dobrynin . To maintain or enhance that credibility, Kennedy had to have discounted that possibility .
 Nobody in the government was certain of Khrushchev's response . Kennedy's statement is remarkable, but it's remarkable that nobody in government knew what would happen .
 Kennedy suggested that he thought that Soviet retaliation was likely . At the very least, Kennedy said he thought it was likely that it would happen .
 Kennedy was trying to establish the basis for a more cooperative approach to crisis resolution . It seems likely that Kennedy was attempting to establish a cooperative approach .
 The pressure on the president to attack Cuba had been greatly intensified by the destruction of an unarmed American reconnaissance plane, Kennedy explained . Kennedy explained at the beginning of the meeting that the damage had been caused by the plane's destruction .
 The president did not want to use force, in part because he recognized the terrible consequences of escalation, and was therefore requesting Soviet assistance to make it unnecessary . President wanted to avoid using force, and therefore requested Soviet assistance .
 This interpretation is supported by the president's willingness to remove the Jupiter missiles as a quid pro quo for the withdrawal of missiles in Cuba . The president's brother's frank confession that the only obstacle to dismantling the Jupiters were political .
 Khrushchev would have to cooperate with the administration to keep the U.S. concession a secret .
 Kennedy's request for an answer by the next day was likely to provoke in Moscow . This was a deliberate attempt to defuse as much as possible the hostility that Kennedy's . request for a response by the . next day would provoke hostility in Moscow, Moscow .
 Dobrynin: Attorney general kept his emotions in check and took the ambassador into his confidence . He says he was trying to cooperate on the resolution of the crisis . Dobrynins: On this occasion, the attorney general kept .
 "This two-pronged strategy succeeded where compellence alone might have failed," says Obama . "This is not the first time the U.S. government has tried to do so," says White House spokesman .
 Khrushchev had incentives to remove Soviet missiles and reduced the emotional cost to him of the withdrawal . The withdrawal of missiles from the Soviet Union was a boost to the Soviet leader .
