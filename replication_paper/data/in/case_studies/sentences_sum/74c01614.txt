 The novel's departure from its author’s classic style has too often caused it to be dismissed as contrived or banal . Even by some of Bowen's most perceptive critics, critics have dismissed the novel's contrived and banal style .
 Bowen offers alternative reading of the coldly comic masking of pain and loss which makes The Little Girls both so funny and so disconcerting, and thus to restore it to its rightful place in the Bowen canon .
 Above all, it is a comedy, but from time to time, possibilities of disaster come into view . "Above all it's a comedy," says the show .
 The Little Girls has long been undervalued by critics, who often seem actively hostile to the novel's departure from what is seen as Bowen's characteristic style . Bowen’s characteristic style has been criticized by critics for its departure from the style .
 Bowen in her closing years was trying to achieve by main force the drama and ambiguity and profundity that accrued naturally to her work in her finest days .
 A World of Love was a shadow, an anemic imitation of the best of her novels . The Little Girls and Eva Trout were tours de force which did not succeed . Eva Trout was a tour de force .
 Though she had completed less than ten pages of the novel she was writing when cancer overtook her in 1973, it seems safe to say this too would have been a failure under the standards she had established in her major fiction .
 Our regret at her going must center on the fact that her autobiography remained largely still unwritten when she died . So, from a literary point of view, our regret is that she had not yet written her autobiography .
 To the outside world, the effect and outcome of the struggle is not at once apparent . All that may be observed is a hardening or harshening of the manner, or a tension between the writer and his accustomed subject .
 Only the rare reader or the perceptive critic is able to detect the transition book . "Only the rare readers or perceptive critics can detect the book's transition," says author .
 The Little Girls is just such a ‘transition book’, although, ironically, Bowen’s novel, Eva Trout, is now largely seen as a remarkable achievement . Bowen's work has only served to further overshadow the more modestly experimental text which freed her to write
 Deirdre Toomey, in her Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Bowen's life, simply ignores The Little Girls altogether .
 The motives of the narrative are often obscure: we can never know just why Dinah suddenly needs so urgently to meet her old friends again . We cannot know why the three decide to dig up the coffer; nor do we know entirely why the trio become so ill, or why the
 It was my ﬁrst Elizabeth Bowen novel, and at the age of 18 I was unaware that it was regarded as in any way problematic . It was also the first time I had read a novel I had seen a novel in my life .
 Despite its fascinating complexity, the book fits neatly into the context created by Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark, both admired by Bowen herself . Despite its complexity, like that of the ‘interlocked puzzle’ of Chinese ivory which the child Clare could never quite solve, it was a
 Muriel Spark’s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was passed around as samizdat literature by classmates at my Edinburgh girls’ school . It may well have been an inﬂuence on Bowen's novel .
 With its wit and its characteristically brilliant texture, the novel is ingeniously constructed . The novel is "ingeniously constructed" and "innoviously constructed," says author .
 "It should be read with that attention to detail generally accorded to a detective story," says the author .
 There is little explanation in The Little Girls, but there are many clues . There are little explanations in the book, but many clues in the film .
 Random sayings or seemingly trivial events may acquire, retrospectively, a strange significance . Even inanimate objects can be important, and random sayings can acquire strange significance, say authors .
 The jacket-notes also tell us that ‘Elizabeth Bowen offers her new novel as a comedy.’ The 1964 jacket-note also tells us that 'Elizabeth Bowen’s new novel is a comedy .
 Lee’s description of The Little Girls as ‘the most “Proustian” of novels’ was amended by Ellmann to ‘proust without sex’ – amended by ‘ProuSt without sex .’ — amended by
 ‘Conventional reading’ is in fact a radical misreading of the end of the book, says author . As I hope to show, this 'conventional reading' is wrong, he says .
 'The Little Girls' is not autobiographical, though others may not, according to Bowen . Bowen wrote to William Plomer, ‘I feel that you saw, though I feel that . you saw ... is not autobiographyographical.’
 We will need to invoke her own concept of ‘transposed autobiography’ to clarify how she was nevertheless able to use both Dinah and Clare as masks through which to explore the unbearable impact of her mother’s early death .
 Bowen writes, rather defensively, that ‘any fiction is bound to be transposed autobiography’
 She had first used the term 10 years earlier about a directly personal piece of fiction, the 1923 short story, ‘Coming Home’ in which a 12-year-old girl imagines that her mother, unexpectedly out when she returns home from school, must in fact have died
 A person might be part of you, almost part of your body, and yet once you went away from them they might utterly cease to be . The writer's work is published by Simon Cowell at the University of Cambridge, England .
 That sea of horror ebbing and flowing round the edges of the world, whose tides were charted in the newspapers, might sweep out a long wave over them and they would be gone . The sea of terror ebbed and flowing around the edges, but they would never be gone,
 At Danielstown, half-way up the avenue under the beeches, the thin iron gate twanged as the last unlit car slid out with the executioners bland from accomplished duty . Above the steps, the door stood open hospitably upon a furnace .
 It is the immolation of Danielstown, rather than the death of Gerald, the English subaltern with whom its heroine Lois is half-heartedly in love, which forms the violent culmination of the novel .
 Bowen’s Court survived, but the terrible last event in The Last September is more real than anything I have lived through . Bowen's Court survived but the last event is still real .
 Bowen subordinates here to the imagined burning of Bowen’s Court . The lived reality of her childhood world began with the tearing apart of her . father's ‘“breakdown,” which was in fact the beginning of an agonizing mental illness’, in consequence
 I had come out of the tensions and mystery of my father’s illness, the apprehensive silences or chaotic shoutings (while he was still there with us in the Dublin house) with nothing more disastrous than a stammer . I had had to come out .
 Bowen was to keep the stammer, which Victoria Glendinning tells us ‘caused her agony as a girl’ , for the rest of her life . Bowen was told he had to keep it from her as a child .
 Bowen’s awareness of the traumatic nature of her speech impediment is revealed in The Heat of the Day . Bowen was resistant to psychoanalysis, but she had a strong sense of her own trauma .
 The variation, she had discovered, had like that in a stammer a psychic cause . It was a matter of whether he did or did not, that day, feel like a wounded man .
 Dicey's nervous blink stands in for Bowen’s stammer . Mrs Piggott dislikes her given name, Diana, chosen by Cousin Roland and discarded by the adult Dinah .
 Elizabeth was 13 when her mother died and, her cousin Audrey’s opinion, she never really got over it . Glendinning tells us, ‘Elizabeth was thirteen when she died and [her cousin] Audrey's opinion] she never got over .’
 Constance, the woman doctor, consumptive, had died in Folkestone nursing home, on her way back from an unavailing Swiss sanatorium .
 April Eddy, the youngest and dearest brother, had gone down with the Titanic . April Edy was the youngest brother of Eddy's brother, Eddy said .
 Florence, my mother, was told by a Dublin doctor, to her delight, that she would be in Heaven six months hence . Florence, her mother, had been told by an Irish doctor that she was in Heaven . Florence's mother, Florence, was in heaven six months later .
 Bowen has already told us that, after her mother’s death, she was in a state of emotional suspension in which her only comfort was to cling to the wearing of mourning, of the euphemistic kind permitted for children . ‘My black’ was the last I had
 For I could not remember her, think of her, speak of her or suffer to hear her spoken of. For she would not be able to remember her again . For she was not able to recall her or remember her .

 Bowen’s stoical relation of what Corcoran, in his illuminating discussion of The House in Paris, calls ‘the psychological and emotional wounding that is parentlessness’ , and her consciously detached and comic conversion of it into the ‘transposed autobiography’ of
 Woolf also lost her mother at the age of 13, in 1895, her half-sister Stella in 1897, her father in 1904, and her brother Thoby in 1906 . Woolf's mother died aged 13 in 1895 and her father died in 1904 .
 Bowen’s decision to craft an anti-nostalgic comedy from the stuff of pain and loss means that its tone is resolutely and disconcertingly different . The three part structure of The Little Girls may owe something to Woolf's novel .
 Both novels relate family deaths to large-scale historical catastrophe . However, both novels relate families' deaths to historical events .
 Dicey’s mother ‘went down in that plague at the end of the war. Twenty or thirty young men were blown up in France, among them Andrew Ramsay, whose death, mercifully, was instantaneous' Dicey's mother 'went down' in the plague at
 The flashback of the second part to 1914 has a softening, mellowing effect on the novel . The flashbacks of 1914 have softening the novel's mellow effect .
 The suppressed romantic feeling between Dicey's beautiful, unworldly mother and Mumbo’s father, the sad, handsome Major, is tenderly touched upon . The schoolgirl comedy is nostalgically idealised .
 Corcoran claims to have ‘nothing of interest to say’ about the novel . But he writes movingly about its elegiac second section, whose picnic and parting on the eve of the First World War is one of the most haunting scenes .
 Bowen’s childhood experience of trauma and loss is a recurring feature of his childhood experience . However, the apparently counter-intuitive connection between desolation and frenetic activity is a recurrent feature of Bowen's childhood .
 The same psychological mechanism is evident in her response to her mother’s death . More painfully, the same psychological mechanisms are evident .
 In the scene from which Corcoran quotes those three grief-laden words, the finality of the parting between Mrs Piggott and Major Burkin-Jones is expressed in a phrase just as brief, which contains Clare's father’s foreknowledge of his coming death .
 Bowen learnt at the age of 13, on her dying mother’s last visit to Bowen's Court, that a blessing could carry precisely that tragic charge of meaning . Bowen had learnt at age 13 that blessing carries a tragic charge .
 The lead-in to this heart-breaking episode is a description of the event which ‘was the first black crack across the surface of exterior things’, the death of her mother’s ‘beloved youngest brother Eddie’ who had gone down on the Titanic
 The blackly comic disjunction between her uncle’s seal impression and his unimaginable death in the icy waters of the North Atlantic must have made his young niece aware that grief itself can be a balancing act made more unendurable by teetering precariously on the edge
 The plot signiﬁcance of this is that ‘there was nothing but gulf’ where St Agatha’s, the little girls’ school, must be, so Dicey realises that they will be able to bury the coffer in its
 He got in a state about leaving us, when the war’d begun, when it didn’t seem to be going well, he said . He said: “He got in an state about . leaving us when it . didn't seem to seem to . going
 Bowen herself had buried a time capsule with her friends at Harpenden Hall, the school she attended after her mother’s death . The real-life proceedings were less impressive, more scatterbrained, and had a tinge of facetiousness .
 The burial of the coffer in the novel is not simply a childish game but a response to the preoccupations of the adult world in the summer of 1914 . However, the burial of a coffer is not just a childish play, it is a response .
 A similar episode takes place in Spark’s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . Sandy and Jenny bury ‘the love correspondence between Miss Brodie and the singing master’
 They were undecided whether to cast this incriminating document out to sea or bury it . They decided not to cast it out of sea or to bury it. They decided to cast the document .
 The act of casting things out to sea from the shore was, as they knew, more difficult than it sounded . It was more difficult to cast things out of the sea than it was expected .
 The notebook containing the love correspondence of Miss Jean Brodie was pressed into a damp hole at the back of the cave .
 The three little girls in Bowen’s novel create their own menacing ﬁction by burying a coffer containing a letter written in human blood and hinting at a sinister and unexplained threat to its future readers .
 The coffer contains a book of poems by a poet who met a premature death by drowning, a baby’s amputated toe preserved in a bottle, and a gun, conceivably loaded . The book was intended to substantiate the story .
 The letter, which in translation begins, ‘We are dead, and all our fathers and mothers’ , will prove to be at least partly prophetic . In translation, it means ‘All our fathers, mothers and children are dead .
 The former schoolgirls will uncover memories of the three deaths . Clare’s father, Dinah's mother, and Sheila’�s lover . The three deaths are all in some way connected to the First World War and its aftermath .
 The grown-up little girls, 11 in 1914, must now be 59, but it is not simply the approach of her 60th birthday, which will mark the end of middle age, that spurs Dinah into searching for them .
 On 4 September 1962, the White House released a policy statement expressing concern about ‘the recent moves of the Soviet Union to bolster the military power of the Castro regime in Cuba’
 The reunion leads us back into the world of 1914, and we return to the present in the second week of October . Dinah visits Clare in one of her chain of gift shops, then writes her a letter in which she proposes the Thursday of the following week as the date for the
 Four days later, Kennedy announced the blockade of Cuba which, if Khrushchev had not backed down, could have led to nuclear war . Four days after the blockade, the blockade was announced by Kennedy, which led to the collapse of Cuba .
 All through that week my heart was rent in a hundred bosoms, says the author . "All the time everything looked so beautiful in its autumn composure," she says .
 The scene which follows the unearthing of the coffer takes place on what must be the morning of 30 October, the day Townsend Warner wrote her letter .
 Monthly weather report of the Meteorological Ofﬁce recorded widespread air frost during the month of October 1962 .
 Raked into tails by the battle into the jerseys her hair hung round a particularly shining morning face, etherealized rather than clouded by grief .
 Dinah’s mother died just as the First World War came to an end . In the next chapter we learn that Dinah's mother died as the WWI ended .
 By this point in the novel, it is clear that the collection of less than expressive objects in the cave, with which Dinah’s friends and acquaintances have humoured her, represents an attempt by a fundamentally lonely and frightened woman to assuage the sense of loss which she
 The day she and my father left for Dublin was very wet, and the gusts shook the Bowen's Court trees . Uncle George’s car, with my mother waving, drove off up the Upper Avenue through the rain . The day my mother and her father left was a very

 Bowen’s Court was demolished by the man to whom she had sold it in 1959 in the mistaken belief that he would bring up his children there . By the time she was writing The Little Girls, Bowen's Court had itself been lost .
 Lee dismisses the literary allusions in The Little Girls as contrived, claiming that they are ‘mostly to Macbeth, in order that the three “revenants” should seem like the three witches’ , but in fact the banter about weird sisters masks the
 Macbeth is one of the most tragic tragedies in the world . "I don’t think most tragedies are sad, they are only tragic," says Shakespeare . "Macbeth" is a tragic tragedy, but it is tragic, says Shakespeare.
 Transposed autobiography allows feelings to be expressed that straight autobiography might forbid . Transposed memoirs allow people to express their feelings that might otherwise be forbidden .
 She tells the horriﬁed Clare that the gun which she found in her mother’s glove drawer and put into the coffer ‘may, of course, have been Father’� But if it was he can’t have been keen on it
 Whether or not Bowen was herself bisexual, she was certainly attractive to women . She gives the adult Clare the tailored clothes and large pearl earrings with which she carried off her own strong and big-boned good looks .
 Clare largely keeps her emotional history to herself (unlike Sheila, who gradually reveals a life-story full of passionate disappointments endured with face-saving stoicism, and ends up teasing Dinah’s sons with the secret of her contribution to the coffer .
 In the opening section of the novel, she looks out of the staircase window of Dinah’s house at the copper beech tree with the crooked swing . ‘pure from the pleasures of the air, any of them could have shot into Kingdom Come.’
 The physical blow to her head fuses in her mind with the emotional blow dealt her by Clare . The emotional blow leads to the illness which brings together three generations of her family and both of her old school-friends .
 Clare, the army child, had rejected Shelley’s belief that tyranny can be countered by passive resistance . Clare rejected Shelley's belief that . tyranny can . be countered with passive resistance for the highly-coloured patriotic honour code represented by Sir Francis Hasting Doyle's poem The Private
 Her anguished rage at Dicey’s failure to understand the unbearable price which that code might soon exact has been frozen into lasting resentment by the memory, preserved ever since, of her own refusal to say goodbye .
 At the end of the novel, it is the sight of Mrs Piggott’s carefully repaired china collection, which she had loved as a child and finds again on the chimneypiece of Dinah's bedroom .
 She was looking into a fragile representation of a world of honour, which was to say unfailingness . The Queen was looking at a 'fragile representation' of a 'world of honour', she said .
 The pastoral ﬁgures on the chimneypiece, branching their mended arms towards one another like trees, represent Clare's father and Dinah's mother . Clare herself has failed to comfort Dinah, who lies broken and sleeping at the far end of the room .
 The ‘peaceful landscapes … on the cups and bowls’ offer an unattainable glimpse of the order and beauty from which Clare, who as a child had scornfully dismissed Wordsworth’s idealised vision of both Nature and childhood, believes herself to be for ever
 When estranged friends or lovers finally meet and name each other, the comedy ends . This is when estranged friends and lovers finally name themselves .
 Mumbo is the name to which Clare had refused to answer as Dicey ran desperately across the Wanchurch sand . Dicey is the one she loves . Clare, lost and now found again, is the ones she loves again .
