 This is a breaking news alert, please stay tuned for an important announcement about a widespread virus in California resulting in the closure of the state's borders 3 days ago . Stay tuned for the announcement .
 As of 3 days ago, the state of California, in concert with the CDC, implemented a statewide quarantine . The quarantine is a state of quarantine .
 Signs and symptoms of virus typically occur 1 -3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus . Symptoms typically occur after 1-3 weeks .
 These include fever, retrosternal pain, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria and proteinuria .
 Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis . Hearing loss has been described .
 The symptoms of the disease are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult . Because of the symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose the disease .
 The most common complication of the illness for those who survive is deafness . Most common complication for those with the disease is hearing loss .
 Various degrees of deafness occur in approximately one-third of cases, and many cases hearing loss is permanent . Hearing loss is possible in many cases, with some cases permanent .
 The disease is believed to be spread by rodents however until it is specifically identified, quarantines will remain in effect . Quarantines are still in place until the disease is identified .
 It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness . It has also been shown that it is most effective in giving early treatment .
 Patients should also receive supportive care consisting of maintenance of appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygenation and blood pressure, as well .
 Initial cases of the disease appeared in the Long Beach area and have been tentatively tied to the arrival of a ship carrying goods from Africa . Initial cases were initially reported in Long Beach, California .
 Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean-Congo viruses are examples of hemorrhagic fever viruses . Ebola is one of the most contagious viruses in the world . Marburg is a virus that causes fever fever and can cause severe symptoms .
 The only case of Ebola in the United States was in Reston, Virginia, in 1989 . The only Ebola case in the U.S. was in Virginia in 1989.
 This specific strand of the Ebola virus caused a rather large panic, but after containment, eventually it was discovered that this specific strand proved fatal only to non-human primates . This strand of Ebola Zaire was found to be a rather small strain of the virus .
 Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and Marburg are very deadly. Ebola Sudan is not all the same. Marburg is very deadly, says CNN's John Sutter . Ebola Sudan, Marburg and Ebola Sudan are also deadly, he says .
 "When I could get to a computer connection, I could confirm what I suspected," he says . "I'm not sure what I was doing," he adds .
 "We were fairly isolated and as soon as the ammo came in for the Tac-50s, we'd be gone in a heartbeat," he says . "In the meantime, we're fairly isolated," he adds .
 A rodent could have been aboard the ship from Africa and somehow spread the disease to our species of rodents . I told him that to his knowledge, there had never been a case outside of Africa, but a rodent may have been on the ship .
 A frequent side effect of Lassa fever was deafness . The side effect is deafness, according to the author of the book "Lassa"
 IIRC, the disease was spread through contract with rodent leaving and contact with infected human material, i.e., blood, stools, etc. The disease was also spread through contact with contaminated human material .
 Jim said he'd check it out and if what I told him didn't connect, someone would let us know . Someone would tell us if something didn't go wrong, he said .

 Nothing could keep the Africanized honey bees from spreading north . It was like Africanized bees, nothing could keep them from spreading .
 Africanized Honey Bees also called ""Africanized bees" or ""killer bees" are descendants of southern African bees imported in 1956 by Brazilian scientists . They were created in Brazil to breed a honey bee better adapted to the South American tropics .
 The first swarm of Africanized bees was detected in the U.S. in October, 1990 . They were captured in a baited trap at the border town of Hidalgo, Texas .
 AHB colonies were first reported in Arizona and New Mexico in 1993 and in California in October, 1994 . AHB colony colonies first appeared in New Mexico and Arizona in 1994 .

 Black Death ended, mostly, with the great fire of London in 1666 when most of the population of black rats was wiped out . The Black Death was mostly wiped out with the Great Fire of London .
 The brown rats weren't good hosts for the fleas that carried the bubonic plague . The plague was spread by brown rats, which carried the plague .
 The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the ""multimammate rat"" of the genus Mastomys . The reservoir is a rat known as a "multimamate rat" of the species Mastomy .
 It is not certain which species of Mastomys are associated with Lassa . However, at least two species carry the virus in Sierra Leone . It's not known which species carry it .
 Mastomys rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa . The species breed very often and produce large offspring, breeding very frequently .
 All these factors contribute to the relatively efficient spread of Lassa virus from infected rodents to humans . The virus is spread by rodents infected with infected rodents .
 The Praomys/Mastomys species complex is a group of morphologically similar species that occur in very diverse habitats throughout subSaharan Africa . It is the largest species complex in the world, with a number of similar species .
 The taxonomy of this group has been clouded by a diversity of opinions . Many external and cranial similarities between species, and thus the systematics of the group remains poorly understood, with many species yet to be described .
 The genus Mastomys is well represented in southern Africa, especially by the ubiquitous multimammate mice . The genus is also well represented by the multi-mammate mouse, Mastomy coucha and Mastomymys natalensis .
 The distribution of both species is only provisional at this stage . The species are known to be sympatric in some areas, and allopatric .
 These common agricultural pests are also commensal with man, often sheltering in houses in order to safely rear their young . Pests often shelter in houses to protect themselves from predators .
 In African kraals they occur in very large numbers, living in the fabric and thatch of pole and mud huts . They are often found living in large numbers .
 Mastomys coucha acts as a reservoir for the Rickettsian Yersinia pestis, the organism causing plague . The organism is a reservoir of the organism responsible for plague .
 The three forms of plague are bubonic, primary pneumonic and primary septicaemic . Bubonic, pneumonic, bubonic or bubonic plague are the three forms .
 Bubonic plague, which is the most common type in epidemics, is fatal in about 25% to 50% of untreated cases . The plague is a form of disease that causes death rates of about 50% to 25% .
 Pneumonic plague, a highly contagious form, and septicaemic plague, are more rare forms, and usually fatal forms . The plague is a generalised blood infection, and is a contagious form .
 Plague still exists as a threat in southern Africa, with much current concern over the possibility of outbreaks in rat infested inner cities .
 We had already had a round of pneumonic plague, during the H5N1 pandemic, introduced by terrorists; or so was claimed by terrorists .
 M natalensis is a natural reservoir for the arenavirus causing Lassa fever . Both species are also carriers of the Banzi and Witwatersrand viruses .
 This infection, occurring predominantly in West Africa up until now, has a high mortality rate, especially amongst pregnant women and even in patients with modern health care . This infection has been predominantly in the West African region .
 The Mopeia virus is another similar virus carried by M natalensis, but the effect thereof on man is as yet unknown . The effect of the virus on man's life is unknown .
 Mastomys rodents linked to outbreak of encephalomyocarditis among African elephants in Kruger National Park in South Africa .
 It is uncertain as to whether only one or both of these species may carry the EMC virus . Both species occur within the boundaries of the park, but it is unknown if only one carries the virus .
