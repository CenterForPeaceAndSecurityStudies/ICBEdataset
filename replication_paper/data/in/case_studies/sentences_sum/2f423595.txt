 In the fall of 1962, American planes photographed Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba .
 The situation quickly escalated with members of both the American and Soviet governments calling for nuclear war . The situation escalated with both the U.S. and the Soviet Union calling for war .
 John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev came to their senses before blowing up the world . Both came to the right decision in the wake of the war .
 Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution threw U.S. leaders into fits of fury . At the heart of the conflict was Cuban leader Fidel Castro, whose 1959 revolution .
 Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean, certainly will appeal to readers fascinated by the intrigue between Castro and Kennedy . The book will be available in the U.S. and Canada .
 Kennedy did approve several plots to kill Castro, but we do know that he was involved in several plots . We don’t know anything concrete about Castro’s involvement in that murder . Kennedy approved several of the plots, including that of Castro .
 von Tunzelmann detailed American outrages committed in the Caribbean during the Cold War . That’s just the start of von Tunzmann’�s detailing of American outrageous acts .
 Focusing on Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic she paints a disturbing picture of the U.S. propping up brutal dictators, overthrowing democratically elected governments, and undermining social reform .
 Beginning with the Spanish-American War of 1898, the United States dominated Cuba . The U.S. dominated Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean until the end of the war .
 President Theodore Roosevelt declared it U.S. policy to act in the best interests of its irresponsible neighbors . Roosevelt declared in 1904 that it was the United States policy to protect its own interests from irresponsible American neighbors .
 In practice, this meant supporting governments that protected American business interests and sending in the Marines when governments threatened those interests . The U.S. supported governments that protect American interests and sent in Marines when those interests threatened .
 These interventions caused long-term resentment toward the U.S. The U.N. intervened in Iraq and Afghanistan . These interventions have caused resentment against the United States .
 As the Cold War developed, Americans became obsessed with keeping its neighbors communist-free . von Tunzelmann points out that Stalin had no interest in world revolution . He says Americans were obsessed with protecting their neighbors from communist neighbors .
 The CIA gave almost unconditional support to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista . Equating social justice and economic rights with communism, the CIA supported the Batista regime .
 Under amazingly long odds, Fidel Castro and his guerillas in the Sierra Madre convinced the dictator to flee at the end of 1958 . Batista’s corrupt government gave rise to many protest movements .
 While Castro avoided identifying with communism, the U.S. took his revolution personally . Castro was looking to end American domination of Cuba . Castro's revolution was the first of its kind .
 The 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion to topple Castro proved an unmitigated disaster for the U.S. The 1961 invasion was a disastrous failure for the United States .
 Von Tunzelmann revisits the frequently asked question of when Fidel Castro became communist . Von Tunzmann: When Castro Castro became a communist, the question was still unanswered .
 I find this debate tiresome but she usefully points out that Castro had flexible ideological leanings in these years . Castro was a flexible ideological thinker, she says .
 She accurately refers to him as a pragmatist, unlike Che Guevara or Raul Castro, who supported communism from the revolution’s start .
 Fidel’s primary goal was a nationalist Cuba free from U.S. Intervention, he might have avoided the Soviet alliance had he any alternative . Fidel's primary goal is a nationalist Cuban free from United States Intervention .
 His relationship with the Soviets waxed and waned over time . Of course, once committed to communism, he turned his attention to developing a centrally planned economy .
 Von Tunzelmann shows that no head of state took advantage of Castro's rise as effectively as the Dominican Republic’s Rafael Trujillo did . Von Tunzmann: No leader of state had a better time to take advantage of the Castro rise .
 Ruling over his nation with an iron fist since 1930, Trujillo tortured, murdered, and raped opponents into submission . Ruled over his country with a iron fist, he ruled over his people for decades .
 The United States supported him throughout his decades in power, seeing him as an unfortunate but necessary anti-communist leader . The U.S. saw him as a necessary and unfortunate leader .

 At first, the reader wonders why she spends so much time on the non-ideological regime of the murderous Francois Duvalier’s Haiti . But at first, she writes that she spends most of her time in the country's most violent regime .
 Duvalier masterfully played Trujillo, Castro, and successive U.S. presidents . But he also masterfully portrayed Trujillillo and Castro .
 He created enough “communists” to convince Americans of his importance . Although he had no particular ideological agenda, he created enough "communists" to convince them .
 By promoting order, he established alliances with the Dominicans . He established alliances of convenience with them .
 While I liked the book, von Tunzelmann sometimes panders to American sensibilities . Von Tunzelman's book was published in 2007 .
 Kennedy about to become a champion of civil rights, Kennedy pulling out of Vietnam . Kennedy pulled out Vietnam, Kennedy rejecting American domination of Latin America . Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 .
 All we can do as historians is judge a president on what he actually did, he says . "All we can really do is judge the president's actions," he says of Obama .
 He approved any number of questionable and illegal activities in the Caribbean . He approved many of the activities in Caribbean .
 Americans want to think the best of Kennedy, but his actual actions don’t support this interpretation . Kennedy’s actions show that he is not the best person in the world, but not the worst .
 Lyndon Johnson pursued a disastrous foreign policy, but it's hard to believe that Kennedy would have done anything much differently . Kennedy’s foreign policy would have been disastrous, but he would have succeeded .
 von Tunzelmann points out that Castro is not a mass murderer on the scale of Duvalier and Trujillo . But for narrative’s sake she frequently lumps the three dictators together .
 Many Americans may think of Castro as the devil, but it's worth noting that Cuban health care, education, and life expectancy far surpasses almost any other nation in the developing world .
 To compare Castro with Duvalier and Trujillo simply doesn't make sense except to note that all three were dictators, which is hardly a revelation . All three dictators were dictators . But to compare Castro .
 Red Heat is a useful and readable primer for U.S. Cold War activities in the Caribbean . Overall, Red Heat was a good primer for Cold War activity .
 Americans as a whole lack knowledge of how their government tolerated, trained, and encouraged some of the world’s most notorious dictators . Americans should know more about how the U.S. government has trained, trained and encouraged dictators .
 The American government found Fidel Castro so shocking that it nearly plunged the world into a nuclear war . The U.S. government found the Castro's shocking behavior so shocking the world nearly went to war with him .
 The Dominican Republic overthrew a democratically elected government in the Dominican Republic because it feared a new Castro . The government overthrew the government because of fears of a Castro-style regime .
 The people of these nations still feel the effects of U.S. foreign policy today in their nations’ poverty, violence, and shaky to nonexistent democratic institutions . The effects of American foreign policy are still seen today in many of these countries today .
