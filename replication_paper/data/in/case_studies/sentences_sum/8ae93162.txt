 Developments in the last two decades have furnished scholars with ample new material to expand and revise the rich historiography . The collapse of the Soviet Union and the declassification of relevant documents by the U.S. government have provided scholars with new material .
 Memoirs, especially those of former Soviet officials, have also proliferated, animating the debate . The debate has also been sparked by the rise of anti-Russian sentiment in Russia .
 The new century has opened the way to a fresh approach that eschews ideological wrangling in favor of dialogue and collaboration among scholars of the former rivals .
 The Cuban experience played a subsidiary role in the momentous clash of titans . Nevertheless, the leading role of the superpowers remains a defining feature of this history’s narrative, with the Cuban experience playing a subsidiary .
 The Missile Crisis As Seen From Cuba stands out as a determined effort to incorporate the Cuban perspective on events prior to, during, and after the actual incident .
 The book’s balanced selection of sources integrates data from official records of the three main protagonists in a step-by-step account . The book also features vignettes of each side's apparent take on the event and its aftermath .
 This encompassing approach yields a panoramic outlook, allowing the reader a glance at the sort of interaction that defined the crisis . The author's approach to the crisis is an attempt to capture the moment the crisis began .
 Government management advanced in close interconnection with military actions . Social organizations, efficient support networks, and policies that became paramount to the regime’s survival in the long run .
 Diez Acosta seems to suggest that the Bay of Pigs assault and the missile standoff signified an ultimately beneficial, rite of passage for the Cuban revolution .
 The book’s approach to the events seems to aim at defining the standoff as yet another, albeit potentially disastrous, imperialist clash of wills . The book's approach seems to be to define the standoff .
 Subliminal ‘we say/ you say’ play on developments, is another of the work’s inventive features . The subliminal "we say" plays on developments .
 A few other instances further suggest vestiges of the Cold War approach to this historiography . The Cold War era was dominated by Cold War imagery .
 Diez Acosta’s account of the Soviets’ military buildup in Cuba, including his assertion that the United States intelligence services had dangerously miscalculated the Soviet nuclear capability, lacks citation of precise sources .
 Although the author strives to remain objective throughout his discussion, the ideological underpinninnings in his discourse seem also unavoidable at times .
 His recurrent reference to “the people of Cuba” seems troubling, considering that the only Cuban voices we hear throughout the account are those of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara .
 In some instances, the insertion of elements with specific metaphoric content to construct a subliminal, ideological vision becomes quite evident . In some cases, it is quite evident that this is the result of an ideological vision .
 The narrative on CIA plots in the island incorporates the “coward/courageous” binary to identify the right sort of Cuban, a stereotype reminiscent of the macho-oriented, homophobic formula that also colored Cuban political discourse at the time .
 Diez Acosta’s evidence on the Cuban mercenaries mainly reproduces the allegations published in other Cuban sources . As is the case with most of the details .
 Despite uneven sourcing, the work still accomplishes its aim of contributing a novel approach to the episode . The work is published on Amazon.com .
 Diez Acosta’s book may have set into motion another sort of blockade, one that could finally interrupt the former superpowers’ intellectual monopoly over the history and story of the Missile Crisis . In addition to incorporating Cuba's experience into the picture, by incorporating Cuba’
 Cuba and its history may also have to evolve into a new era, beyond the Cold War juxtaposition of victims and villains; heroes and rogues . But in order to accomplish this successfully, Cuba's history will need to evolve, perhaps more .
