 President Johnson asked about British trade with Cuba and whether President Kennedy had objected to it in his meetings with the British Prime Minister . President Kennedy said he objected to the trade in meetings with British PM .
 They would maintain that Cuba is no worse than the Soviet Union and that we greatly exaggerate this, and in their public, theyd be right . They would be right, they would say, but in the public theyd be wrong .
 Director of Central Intelligence McCone briefed the President on the status of Cuban economic developments, among a number of other subjects . The President was briefed on Cuba's economic developments .
 McCone reviewed reports of increasing Spanish exports, British and Dutch tire and bus parts sales, and Soviet arms shipments to Cuba . McCone also reviewed with the President reports of increased Spanish exports .
 Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the Special Group . This recommendation is based on a routine continuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may .
 All of these operations would have been approved three months ago, officials say . One of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted because of high seas . The operation is rescheduled because of the high seas.
 If we continue these even small sabotage operations, Castro will know it . Castro will certainly know it, if he continues to sabotage the Castro government .
 If we call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians . Equally, if we call it off, it will be Russia's fault, and if we do it, he knows it .
 I recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle of covert sabotage against Cuba . I therefore recommend a . Cabinet . level review . of the . principle of . covert sabotage .
 "I know that Rusk has never liked it and that McNamara thinks it does very little good," says McNamara . Rusk says he's never liked Rusk, but McNamara says it does little good . McNamara: "I think it's a waste of time and
 McCone and the CIA are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the Castro problem . The CIA is for it . McCone says he's for it.
 I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced, but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal, ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy . I would be happy to see the end of the sabotage attacks,
 I might then wish to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union. I might well wish to . make a bit of capital from the decision with Soviet Union .
 The President entered the room shortly, accompanied by Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti . The President was accompanied by the President .
 The President then reverted to Cuba and said that he questioned seriously whether these sabotage efforts were the proper thing for the United States to be doing .
 He thought they were both hypocritical and ineffectual . "He thought probably these considerations were outweighed by the hypocrisy of our seeking peace and talking peace," he said .
 Rusk said that he had never been in favor of this program and had the same doubts the President did . Rusk also said he had doubts about the President's plan .
 McNamara said he too had never been in favor of this program and questioned our participation . McNamara also questioned the program's legality .
 Cuba has seen increase in sabotage actions from internal Cuban elements over which we exercise no control . I said that over the long run you could not expect the Castro regime to fall from these actions alone but that every little bit helped .
 I said that I could not take exception to the fact that this policy was a hypocritical one in the light of a peace offensive . I did not feel we were trying to make peace with Castro, he said . I said .
 I also pointed out that sabotage activities in North Vietnam likewise had hypocritical aspects . I also said that North Vietnam's sabotage activities had hypocritical parts of the country .
 Mr McNamara demurred and said North Vietnam was an entirely different matter . He gave no reasons therefor and this point was not developed further .
 General Taylor noted that in connection with sabotage operations they kept Castro constantly on the alert and kept his forces heavily occupied running hither and yon . General Taylor also noted that .
 The President noted that this was probably true but so little gain in it and generally seemed disaffected with sabotage efforts . The President said he was disaffected by sabotage efforts and seemed disinterested in it .
 Rusk pointed out that there was some value in maintaining some pressure of this type since to completely desist would eventually lead Castro to believe that he was immune from retaliation . Rusk said there was value in keeping some pressure on Castro .
 The President directed that he wanted a complete review of our Cuban policy and some new, imaginative thinking developed, he said . The President then directed .
 I stated that this was presently heavily in train in all appropriate agencies of the Government, and Rusk and McNamara nodded their agreement . I said that this is presently heavily . in train .
 The President said he would want to meet as soon as people had drawn up their proposals .
 The President continued to desire the most drastic pressures on our Allies to insist upon their cooperation and assistance in our economic denial program against Cuba . In connection with Cuba the President noted that he continued to .
 Italy and West Germany to cease any further Cuban trade, says German president . He said Segni and Erhard had both assured him we could count on the full cooperation of Italy and Germany .
 He said he wanted similar discussions prepared for him whenever he met these leaders . He said: "I want our leaders to take the same line in any discussions they might have"
 No drafting information appears on the paper, but an April 6 memorandum from Joseph W Scott to U Alexis Johnson indicates it was prepared by Desmond FitzGerald, Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division, Directorate of Plans, Central Intelligence Agency .
 During 1963 the situation in Cuba steadily worsened . The current Situation in Cuba is described as the Cuban situation in 1963 .
 The economy continued its decline and Castro was not able to halt the downward curve . Castro was able to stop the decline of the Cuban economy .
 Disillusionment and apathy among the great majority of the population continued to grow, and enthusiasm was increasingly restricted to a hard core .
 As popular support waned, coercion and terror were employed more and more to maintain the regimes control . The regimes use of terror was used to maintain control of Syria .
 Castro’s drive to convert Cuba into a standard communist prototype caused increasing disillusionment among his original followers . Castros drive for Cuba to be a standard Communist prototype caused him to become disillusioned .
 Castro's stature in the eyes of many Cubans and Latin Americans suffered with the realization, in the aftermath of the October missile crisis, that Cuba had been a pawn and Castro a dupe of Soviet policy .
 Despite extraordinary efforts, Castro has not been able to stop acts of defiance against his regime . Castro has been unable to prevent acts of rebellion against him .
 Refugees still elude Cuban security forces and sea patrols to escape from Cuba . At great risk refugees elude his security forces . Cuban refugees are still at great risk .
 In this atmosphere, externally mounted raids against Cuban targets have added to Castro�s sense of frustration and helped sustain hope among the many Cubans disillusioned with his regime .
 During 1963 Cubas international situation seemed almost as bad as the domestic . During 1963, Cubas international troubles seemed almost equally bad as its domestic problems .
 Although chinks appeared in the wall, the U.S. policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba was holding up fairly well . Cuba's Cuba relations with the United States have been strained in recent years .
 Castro scored no foreign policy victories to provide a much needed psychological boost . Castro's lack of foreign policy wins will not provide a boost to his political standing .
 His major effort to stimulate Castro-type armed uprisings throughout Latin America failed to disrupt the Venezuelan elections of December . He netted a potentially embarrassing exposure that Cuba had shipped arms clandestinely to Venezuela .
 These internal and international trends and developments brought Cuba to a low point during 1963 . Cuba was at its lowest point during that year .
 Five developments have given the Castro regime an important political-psychological lift . The Castro regime has been in the grip of a growing anti-Castro sentiment .
 High sugar prices in the world market have enabled Cuba to expand its convertible currency reserves from about $20 million to almost $100 million during the year . Cuba's currency reserves have grown from $20million to $100million in 2013 .
 The Soviet-Cuban trade protocol for 1964 was signed on January 11, signed by Khrushchev on January 22 . It showed a willingness to maintain its aid and trade program at a very substantial level and support Cuban sugar prices .
 Soviet exports, about 40 per cent of which will be on credit, will increase by at least 10 per cent . Soviet exports will be increased by about ten per cent, according to the government .
 The U.S. policy of economic and diplomatic isolation of Cuba may not be able to stand in the face of increasing pressures from Western countries to expand trade with Cuba, extending credit if necessary . The distinct possibility that the United States policy of isolation may not stand .
 The British bus deal, with payment spread over a five-year period, is an important political and psychological triumph for Castro . The deal is spread over five years and is a political victory for the Castro family .
 The recent rioting and violence in Panama, which Castro had some hand, will inject new revolutionary fervor into Castroite activities . Castro's involvement in the Panama rioting has been a major factor in the Castroite movement .
 Panama and its aftermath will take the play away from the incident of the Venezuela arms cache . In addition, Panama and the aftermath of the Panama incident will also take the issue away from Venezuela . Panama is the first time the U.S. has been involved in the Panama crisis .
 The revolt in Zanzibar is bound to impress Latin America as well as other unstable areas with the length of Fidels arm and potency of his doctrine .
 Castro’s regime badly needed, Castros regime has been badly needed . Castros regime needs the upward political and psychological thrust needed, says Castro�'s regime .
 He now has a firmer base for his repeated claims that Cuba has survived the full brunt of a major U.S. effort to destroy the Cuban revolution . Claims likely to impress many Latin Americans as well as Cubans .
 Castro now has the possibility of producing some tangible evidence that his regime can restore forward momentum in the economy . Castro also has the chance of producing tangible evidence of his regime's ability to restore momentum .
 The general position of the Castro regime is much improved over that of three or four months ago, says Castro . Consequently, the position of Castro regime has improved, he says .
 The ultimate United States objective is the replacement of the present government in Cuba by one fully compatible with the goals of the United States . The ultimate U.S. objective is to replace the present Cuban government with a fully compatible government . The United States has been involved in the Cuban Revolution since
 To attain this objective, we are trying, by exerting maximum pressure through all means short of the use of military force, to create a degree of disorganization, uncertainty and discontent in Cuba . This will predispose elements in the military and other power centers of the regime to bring
 In order to create the optimum situation just described, we have been carrying out a program of integrated, mutually reinforcing and mutually dependent courses of action . We are carrying out an integrated and mutually reinforcing course of action. We are happy to clarify that this is not the first time we have seen
 Cuba has been isolated from the free world for more than a decade . Cuba's isolation is part of the Cuban government's isolation from the world . Cuba is now isolated in the world's most populous countries .
 Denial of free-world markets and sources of supply to Cuba: We have undertaken a variety of overt and covert activities designed to reduce free world trade with Cuba . Cuba is denied access to commodities critical to its economy .
 Proposals for expanding and intensifying these activities are now being presented . Proposal to expand and intensify these activities is being presented by the government .
 "The execution of these additional measures depends basically on a decision to incur the considerable political costs and risks that are entailed," says President Obama .
 We have maintained diplomatic pressure on free-world nations to reduce and eventually eliminate their ships in the Cuba trade . The U.S. has maintained pressure on countries to reduce their ships .
 The reduction of free world, and the containment of Soviet Bloc, air service to Cuba, was part of the reduction of air service .
 U.S. invoked recent legislation denying assistance to countries whose ships and aircraft carry commodities to and from Cuba . We are invoking recent legislation .
 Cuban airlines serving or trying to serve Cuba, or harass such airlines, are subject to diplomatic pressure . In addition, we have exerted diplomatic pressures on free-world countries to deny their facilities to Soviet Bloc and Cuban airlines .
 "As opportunity has offered, we have exerted pressure to persuade free-world countries to break diplomatic relations with Cuba or to prevent the establishment of such relations," the UK says .
 "By means of diplomatic, propaganda and covert measures we have endeavored to demonstrate the weakness, failures and betrayals of the Castro regime," says President Obama . "We have endeavoured to demonstrate ... the weakness of Castro regime"
 As indicated above, all efforts to bring about disorganization, uncertainty and discontent in Cuba are intended to weaken the Cuban base for Castro/Communist subversion . The U.S. government is trying to weaken Cuba's base for subversion, the U.N. says .
 Latin American recognition of the seriousness of the threat posed by Cuba . OAS has approved recommendations of measures to limit travel to and from Cuba, and the transfer of funds and propaganda .
 OAS will take action on the basis of the Venezuelan complaint against Cuba . At the present time, we intend to expand and intensify this effort through actions to be taken by the OAS .
 Central American countries and Panama have made special efforts to tighten controls on subversives, he says . b. We are working to develop inland and inshore surveillance capabilities, he adds .
 Through training, material assistance and exchange of intelligence, we have worked to improve the internal security capabilities of individual countries . c. c. We have worked with countries to improve their security capabilities, we said .
 In addition to multilateral and bilateral measures, we have continued to maintain our surface patrols in the vicinity of Cuba, to improve our own communications systems .
 The reduction and eventual elimination of the Soviet military presence in Cuba has been announced . We have maintained diplomatic pressure on the Soviets to continue troop withdrawals . We will not tolerate the use of Soviet forces in Cuba to suppress popular uprising, we have warned .
 We have maintained and improved our overt and covert collection of intelligence to meet U.S. strategic requirements . We have also improved our covert and overt and overt collection of information .
 "We have maintained periodic high-level overflights supplemented on a few occasions by low-level flights," says U.S. Air Force .
 We have warned the Soviets and Cubans against interference with these flights . We have also warned the Soviet and Cuban governments not to interfere .
 As stated above, all these courses of action interact and are interdependent . All courses of actions interact and interdependent, says author of the book .
 Our covert economic denial operations are designed to reinforce and be reinforced by our overt measures of economic pressure . For example, our covert economic . denial operations were designed to . reinforce and . reinforced by . overt measures, they say .
 Both types of activities directed against the economy are intended to aggravate existing economic difficulties and thus to increase the level of disaffection not only in the popular mass but particularly in the power centers of the regime .
 This disaffection enhances our ability to establish meaningful contact with figures in the military, other power centers and develop intelligence sources, says the British government .
 This disaffection is intensified by the evidence of vulnerability to outside attacks provided by the success of covert sabotage and harassment activities . This is in turn intensified by evidence of the . success of . covert sabotage, harassment activities, says the author .
 The failure or elimination of one of these mutually supporting courses of action jeopardizes the others and thus compromises the entire program . By the same token, the failure of one or two mutually supporting course of action can also jeopardize the others .
 Through 1963, these courses of action were having a measurable positive impact on the nation's economy . The U.S. government was taking steps to improve the economy .
 We are confronted, however, by a series of developments, described in Section I, which threaten to arrest or even reverse our forward movement . We are now confronted by developments which could arrest or reverse our progress, we say .
 "The situation is particularly acute with respect to the maintenance of our economic pressures," says minister . The situation is "particularly acute" in the UK, he says .
 This fact makes this review of our covert operations particularly timely and important . This fact . makes this . review . particularly timely, important .
 The CIA covert action program aims at maintaining all feasible pressures on Cuba and at creating and exploiting situations in Cuba calculated to stimulate dissident elements within the regime, particularly in the armed forces, to carry out a coup .
 The objective of the coup would be to remove the Castro/Communists from the regime and eliminate the entire Soviet presence from Cuba . The objective would be removing the Castro and Communist Party from the government, the author says . The coup would remove Castro/communist from the Cuban regime and
 The U.S. is engaged in a race against time with Cuba and its Soviet ally to obstruct the consolidation of Castro’s regime at home and to prevent him from achieving his ambitions in Latin America . The time frame for this program was set from June 1963 .
 As originally conceived and approved in June 1963, the covert action program was based on the assumption that U.S. policy precludes a military invasion or a full blockade of Cuba which could lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Union . The program was designed to prevent a military or full blockade
 The inter-action of the overt and covert effort against Cuba is regarded as a vital and irreplaceable factor if there is to be any hope of accomplishing the overall mission . Thus, the inter-actions of the covert and overt and overt efforts against Cuba are regarded as vital and
 Covert collection of intelligence to meet U.S. national security requirements and support current and planned covert operations .
 It should be noted that clandestine maritime operations are an integral part of intelligence collection . The operation is part of the CIA's clandestine operations .
 Propaganda actions to stimulate low-risk simple sabotage, sabotage and other forms of active and passive resistance against the regime .
 Economic denial actions in support of government-wide overt overt official U.S. economic isolation measures . Economic isolation measures are considered in the United States' economic isolationist measures .
 Cuban armed forces and other power centers of the regime to encourage disaffection, according to the author . Castro/Communist factions to carry out a coup against Castro/communist factions, he says .
 CIA is identifying, contacting and attempting to establish channels of communication with these individuals . CIA is currently trying to contact and establish channels to establish communication with those individuals .
 General sabotage and harassment as an economic weapon and as a stimulus to internal resistance . General sabotage as a means of economic and political warfare . General sabotment and harassment as an economic tool .
 As an economic weapon, it is designed to supplement and support the overall economic denial program by damaging economically important installations and to add to Castros economic problems by forcing him to divert money, manpower and resources from economic to internal security activities .
 As a stimulus to resistance, sabotage and physical harassment operations provide visible and dramatic evidence of the existence and capability of organized resistance against the regime .
 To the extent that these operations are successful, they also demonstrate to the Cuban population and elite groups the vulnerability of the regime to militant action . The operations are also .
 Cuba believes the cumulative psychological and political impact within Cuba of sustained sabotage operations is a necessary element in the accomplishment of our mission . It is recognized that no single act of sabotage by itself can materially affect the economy or stimulate resistance .
 These operations are intended to provide a deniable activity, a means of supplementing and expanding our covert capability . The operations are meant to take advantage of untapped political and resistance resources of the exile community .
 Of the foregoing inter-locking courses of action, items and are in train . No policy problems regarding them are expected to be expected .
 Item is the subject of another paper which is being presented for concurrent consideration . Item is also subject of consideration in another paper presented for consideration .
 " Item is the essence of our program and is dependent for its success on the results of all other overt and covert courses of action" " Item" is the "essence of the program"
 Item has been the subject of continual review since the inception of the program and is the primary subject of this paper . Item is the main subject of the paper, and has been subject of review since inception .
 At least 80 acts of internal sabotage and 60 armed clashes between Cuban security forces and insurgents since 1 June . The Sabotage Program in Retrospect . Cuba has been hit hard by internal sabotage since June 1, 2012 .
 Insurgency and sabotage inside Cuba are not part of a coordinated program, says the Cuban government . They are acts of individual or small group defiance, the government says . Insurgencies and sabotage are not coordinated programs, the Cuban president says .
 "No one factor can be assigned entire credit," says CNN.com's John Sutter.com . Sutter: "I'm not sure how much of this is true, but I'm sure it's true."
 Sabotage incidents, which include a high proportion of sugar cane burnings, have a tendency to be seasonal, a fact which further obscures statistical analysis . Sabotages are often seasonal, with a higher proportion of burnings being seasonal .
 The Cuban regime was responsible for a number of sabotage incidents in the fall of 1963 . The Cuban government was accused of a "harassment program" by the government .
 There was substantial damage to the target; all participants were safely recovered and the plausible deniability of the operations was not compromised . All participants were recovered and all participants recovered .
 The lack of proof of U.S. involvement did not prevent Castro from charging the CIA with responsibility . Castro charged the CIA in the attack .
 Almost every act of defiance against his regime has been credited to the Agency . The Agency is responsible for almost all of the acts against the regime .
 Castro’s emotional reactions to real or rumored security threats point up his acute sensitivity to internal resistance . Castros reaction suggests that he feels his regime to be far from secure from external threats .
 The Soviet Union has reacted to the sabotage raids with less vigor and bluster than we anticipated, says David Frum . The U.S. has reacted with much more vigor than we expected, Frum says .
 Air raids sponsored by Cuban exile groups during August and September sponsored by exile groups operating from Florida . Agency had no responsibility for the attacks .
 They did no real damage, but they did demonstrate that the Cuban air defense system could be breached . The raids added substantially to the psychological impact of our first two raids, the U.S. says .
 The cessation of these raids, however disclaimed by the United States the raids themselves may be, would probably be interpreted in Latin America and certainly inside Cuba as a switch of U.S. policy from one of discreet encouragement and support of aggressive action against the Castro regime to one of ""
 Without constant and visible signs of offensive action against Cuba, a weakening process would be set in motion . Latin America could well lead the countries of Latin America to draw their own conclusions from these indicators .
 Those governments in Latin America already threatened by Castroites in their own countries are likely to be subjected to even stronger domestic pressures . The Castroites are already under pressure from their own governments .
 As this belief spreads, Western European and other free world countries eager to trade with Cuba will come to feel that they may safely ignore and evade, to an even greater extent . U.S. appeals for the economic and political isolation of Cuba to be isolated .
 An important additional economic effect would be the release into normal economic activity of manpower and funds now tied up in defense against raids . The release of manpower would be an important economic effect .
 This development in time is bound to have a severe demoralizing effect on the internal resistance against Castro . Castro’s internal resistance will be demoralized, the author says .
 Cuban exile community and particularly its militant and articulate elements would be acutely sensitive to a cessation of raids and can be expected to react vociferously .
 Judging from past experience, we can expect a new surge of domestic political agitation . In the event that it is decided to terminate CIA-controlled sabotage and harassment operations, it cannot be assumed that the autonomous groups, despite the greater deniability of their actions, could take over entirely the mission
 Autonomous groups are as yet untested in their capability to conduct successful sabotage and harassment operations on a sustained basis . Autonomy groups are yet to be tested in their ability to carry out successful sabotage or harassment operations, say experts .
 It is unlikely that in the next months the autonomous groups will develop the ability to match CIA-controlled operations, either in quantity or quality .
 If sabotage and harassment operations were to be terminated for the . autonomous groups as well as for the Agency, its support to the autonomous groups must also be terminated completely . Otherwise we would not be in a position to . insure that they would discontinue raids and sabotage .
 Such termination would compound the effects of the cessation of our own raids, particularly in those areas in the Caribbean where the autonomous groups have been most active, says the government . Such termination of the raids would be a blow to the Caribbean, he says .
 In the event it is decided to abandon the core of the covert program, we will be obliged to fall back on essentially overt courses of action . The Residual Program can be refined and intensified, provided the political risks and costs are judged acceptable .
 A series of recommendations to intensify this course of action has been made and is now being presented . Action against free-world economic ties with Cuba has been presented .
 "The basic issue in the recommendations is our ability and willingness to incur the political costs and risks that heightened economic pressure would involve," the report says . The report was published in March .
 Even if the recommendations are adopted completely, we could have no real assurance that our attempts to curtail Cubanfree world economic ties would be successful, says the U.S. government .
 If the actions and commitments included in the recommendations are not adopted, it is a near certainty that, under present circumstances, our economic pressures will be reduced to ineffectiveness . On the other hand, if the . actions and . commitments included . in the proposals are not . adopted,
 No amount of economic pressure can by itself bring down the Castro government, at least as long as the Soviets are prepared to subsidize the Cuban economy . In any case, it must be clearly recognized that no amount of pressure can bring down Castro government by itself .
 The curtailment and disruption of Cuban economic ties with the free world can only contribute, and then only over time, to the creation of the optimum situation we are trying to develop, says Cuban President Vladimir Putin .
 The effectiveness of this contribution would be at least sharply impaired by the relaxation of the pressure created by covert operations, the author says . The effectiveness would be sharply impaired, he says .
 "We can never have assurance that a foreign government cooperating in the economic program will not pull out and virtually collapse the program," says President Obama . "Beyond these considerations, we can never ... have assurance"
 Britain's reliance on economic pressure as a substitute for the covert program would be to deliver the fate of our policy into the uncertain hands of governments which do not share our convictions and sense of priority with Cuba .
 It should be noted that the atmosphere for OAS adoption of strong measures has deteriorated as a result of the Panamanian crisis . The atmosphere for the OAS has deteriorated due to the crisis in the country, it says .
 A break in diplomatic relations would mean action by five countries, including Brazil, Chile and Mexico . It would provide dramatic evidence of Castro's isolation and deny the Cuban regime subversive facilities .
 The measure would meet heavy resistance from Mexico, Chile and particularly Brazil . It would also meet resistance from Chile, Mexico and especially Brazil .
 A break in economic relations with Cuba would have little practical effect economically . It would have some utility as a means of moral pressure on other freeworld countries trading with Cuba .
 A break in air and surface communications would lead to a reduction in the Cuban ability to move subversives to and from Latin America . Over time this would reduce the Cuban movement of subvertsives to Latin America.
 It would be useful as a means of moral pressure on other free-world countries having, or wishing to establish, air services with Cuba .
 On the negative side it would mean the temporary loss of intelligence facilities and would have an adverse effect on Cuban exile morale by closing an existing escape route for persons inside Cuba .
 The single most damaging OAS action to Castro would be an authorization for the use of force in connection with the movement of arms and men . Approval for cooperative surveillance measures against movement of weapons and men would be most damaging action .
 The chances of getting a politically acceptable majority for such use was estimated to be less than even before the events in Panama and the prospects have diminished since then . The prospects of getting such a majority in Panama have also diminished since the events there have diminished .
 Such OAS action would almost certainly dramatize the Cuban issue domestically and internationally . Such action would be almost likely dramatizing the Cuban Issue domestically and international .
 At the present time, it appears that the surveillance system which might be authorized by the OAS would involve the use of force only in the territorial waters of the countries for which the offending shipments are .
 The question of OAS authorization for the use of force on the high seas will not arise . Thus the question will not be raised by OAS .
 This would be a pro forma action, with only limited psychological force . Condemnation of the Castro regime would be only a pro-forma action . This is not the first time this has happened in the U.S.
 In sum, this series of OAS measures would certainly be helpful and would constitute important multilateral progress . The OAS has been criticized for its lack of transparency in recent years .
 Increased efforts to increase the ability of Latin America to resist subversion, he says . Increased efforts against subversion can be increased, he adds .
 If the Cuban base were to be strengthened by the relaxation of covert pressures or by the weakening of economic pressures, we will be fighting against increasing odds . In any case, if the . relaxation of . covert pressures were . to be relaxed, they said .
 Increased psychological and propaganda efforts will be intensified . We can intensify our measures in this sector, including major policy declarations on Cuba .
 The efficacy of such efforts is entirely dependent upon the substance behind them, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 A propaganda offensive would be productive only if there is credible evidence that our words were being accompanied by successful actions in other sectors . A propaganda campaign should be successful only if it is accompanied by success in other areas, says Mr Hammond .
 The residual program set out above is substantially weaker than the present program . Conclusion is that the residual program is weaker than that set out in the program .
 The prospects for attaining our ultimate objective of replacing Castro/Communist regime, which have been by no means certain even under the present program, would be very measurably diminished under the residual program .
 Recommendation that the covert program be continued in at least its present form and scope . Recommendation That the program should continue in its current form .
 Free-world trade with Cuba increased perhaps as much as $5075 million over 1962, to a total of $250$320 million . Trade between Cuba and the U.S. increased perhaps $50 to $320 million in 1963 .
 The increase reflects larger free-world purchases of sugar at higher prices because of the world sugar shortage . The increase in sugar prices reflects larger purchases by the world of sugar .
 There appears to have been little or no increase in free-world exports to Cuba . Free-world trade has increased in recent months .
 Calls by free-world vessels in Cuba fell 60 percent in 1963 . British and Lebanese ships now predominate in Cuba .
 Aviation ties with Cuba were sharply reduced in 1963, with Spanish activity running counter to the general trend .
 Some significant critical commodities of non-US origin have been denied, but substantial amounts of such items have been supplied . Some of these items have in spite of our efforts been supplied, the government says .
 There is a reasonable chance for a modest decrease in free-world shipping in 1964, says author .
 Aviation ties will probably be cut back, but the conclusion of a USUSSR aviation agreement will reduce our leverage . The conclusion of the agreement will . reduce our . leverage, he says .
 Cuban earnings aspect of the problem, the world-wide shortage of sugar and increased sugar prices make it impracticable at the present time to shut off Cuban sales of sugar to free-world buyers .
 Cuba is now embarking on a major effort to acquire free-world goods, not only to meet present shortages but to provide the means for an upturn in its economy . With these increased earnings, Cuba has increased earnings .
 Our problem is not just reducing the present level but preventing such an upturn, it is preventing such a revival . The government is not only reducing the current level but also preventing a revival in the economy .
 Cuba will be an increasingly attractive customer of the Soviet Union, writes Andrew Hammond . Even where blocked from direct purchases from the free world, may be able indirectly to procure some goods through the USSR . However, this is going to be increasingly difficult as, with the increased foreign exchange reserves at
 The Soviet Union can itself make up additional shortages in the Cuban economy, albeit at some additional cost to itself and with delays in delivery . Also, of course, the Soviet Union itself can make up the shortages .
 Even if our efforts are fully successful, the cutting off of free world sources of supply cannot be expected to have a decisive effect on the Cuban economy . Thus, even if our . efforts are . fully successful the cutting . off of . free world supplies of . supply cannot . have a
 Well-executed denial programs can seriously impair specific segments of the economy . Cuba should not be able to use increased sugar earnings to bring about any significant upturn, says author .
 Cuba will increasingly be able to ""normalize"" its economic relations with other free-world countries, says President Obama . Cuba will probably bring about an upturn in its economy, he says .
 Britain's attitude, economic importance and special relationship with us, we need cooperation of the British. Because of their attitude and economic importance, the UK needs cooperation of us. We need cooperation from the British, says the Prime Minister .
 "The recent sale of buses has had and will have grave consequences for our denial program," says the U.S. State Department . The sale will have "grave consequences" for the country, officials say .
 The effectiveness of our efforts to get the cooperation of any country depends on the relative importance to the national interest of the objective of cutting off Cuban access to critical commodities and other objectives in the country . The balance of negotiating advantage between the country and us; and the degree of risk to other
 U.S. firms have been cooperative and effective in putting pressure on associated foreign firms . American firms are effective in pressuring associated foreign companies, says CNN.com's Tom Charity .
 While this technique might be expanded, it would involve problems of ""extraterritoriality"" with our Allies . The technique might also involve problems with our allies .
 We have severe problems in obtaining timely intelligence in depth and pursuing investigations because of the very nature of the trade in critical commodities and US-origin goods . We have serious problems in getting timely intelligence, says the U.S. government .
 Improvement in these sectors requires additional personnel, especially if controls on American know-how are extended to all commodities produced in Cuba .
 Our prospects for success in the economic conflict with Cuba ultimately depend on the priority to be assigned this effort . The results of this effort are at best uncertain .
 The recommendations on pages 2022 of the study are feasible but will create frictions in our international relations . The recommendations are feasible, but they are likely to be difficult to implement, the study says .
 I suggest that, before you move on them, you may wish to convene an NSC session to explore all the issues with the participating agencies . Since carrying them out will involve several NSC agencies, I suggest .
 A January 14 memorandum from Mann to Ball, the study was prepared by the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in collaboration with INR and the Bureau of Economic Affairs . According to a January 14 memo from Mann, Ball received a memorandum from the Coordinator .
 The restriction and reduction of free-world economic ties with Cuba is a basic national policy objective . The President should make known to all agencies of government that this is a policy objective, he says .
 That the President or the Secretary of State take an early opportunity to make a public declaration on Cuban policy, with special attention to the rationale of our policy on free-world economic ties .

 Cuban public statements, press releases and broadcasts have been focused on Guantanamo issue . First, Cuban statements have been made in the last ten days focused on the issue .
 Cuban ships were fishing in our territorial waters on February 2nd and there were fish aboard of the type caught in these waters . Second, the Cuban ships caught fish of the same type of fish aboard . The incident occurred in the same territorial waters .
 Third, there was no absolute evidence that the ships were dispatched or directed to national waters as against having been directed into traditional U.S. fishing grounds . No absolute evidence of the ships being dispatched .
 Cuban authorities were advised that the ships were in U.S. national waters at the time they were seized . Cuban authorities have been advised that they were in United States national waters .
 Castro’s actions regarding the Guantanamo water supply took place four days after the ships were apprehended which raises some question as to whether Guantanamo was a part of the original plan . Castros actions took place just days after ships were captured .
 Mac Bundy stated that the easiest part of the decision to reach was reaching the Florida legal problem . Bundy said the decision was reached after the state of Florida . Bundy: "The easiest part to reach is to reach an agreement with the governor"

 Johnson called Senator Russell to discuss the wording of the statement to be issued that evening . The Presidents advisers disagreed over two different alternatives and proposed releases .

 Attorney General: Dismissal of Base employees was an overreaction to Castro's move . Attorney General says it hurt the wrong Cubans who by and large had been loyal Base employees .
 Mr McCone also opposed the dismissal on these grounds . Other countries might fear a similar action in the event of a disagreement with them .
 Without the economic benefits of the Base salaries, this rental figure will stand out and weaken our Guantanamo position . Without economic benefits, it will weaken the Guantanamo position.

 What I’m worried about, theres one thing that worries me about the whole thing. What Im worried is that theres one person who worries about the future of the country .
 I think theyll demonstrate and raise hell, and all that Im prepared for, but the one thing that I thought was the word reduce, that doesnt mean anything to me . I think that doesn’t mean ‘reduce’

 "We probably just ought to put discontinue in regardless what they said," says CNN.com's John Defterios .
 I just didn’t wantRusk had gone along with us and I didnt want to have a fight with him, but in doing it nowyou reduce them or put them on that base, I mean discontinue them .
 "Theyll get plans and bring it back here, then well get it moving on it," says mayor . The mayor's office is looking at the possibility of bringing it back to the U.S.

 Cuban fishing vessels knew they were fishing inside the territorial sea of the United States . Cuban authorities in Havana were also aware of this fact . Havana: "Well no, this is national water, national water Havana: I understand"
 Government of Cuba has no justification whatsoever for suspending water service to the Guantanamo Naval Base . The suspension is in direct violation of the existing contract between the water company and the Base which runs until 1969 .
 The Government of the United States protests in vigorous terms this totally unwarranted action . There can be no relationship whatsoever between measures taken by the U.S. against persons who have violated its laws and the suspension of water service to the Naval Base .
 Any effort to do so is "entirely inadmissible to the Government of the United States," the government says .
 The case of Cuban nationals apprehended illegally fishing in U.S. territorial waters will proceed under the full guarantees for a fair trial by the State of Florida .
 Chase forwarded the paper to Bundy under cover of a February 10 memorandum, in which Chase wrote that Crimmins and other Cuban experts "intended to seriously explore the possibilities and problems involved in closing off the American market" using the Trading with the Enemy Act .

 First, for obvious reasons, we want to cut down Free World export of critical commodities to Cuba . First, the government wants to stop the flow of vital commodities to the country .
 Second, we want to hold down or cut down the level of Free World trade with Cuba . We want to cut down or hold down the . level of . Free World Trade with Cuba with Cuba, says President Obama . Obama wants to keep Cuba free trade with the world .
 "This reduction of Free World/Cuban commercial contacts is consistent with our overall isolation policy," says the State Dept. of Cuba .
 The level of Free World/Cuban trade does not rise precipitously during 1964 . Also, it is probably important for other reasons that the level of . Free World trade did not rise during 1964, however .
 U.S. business community would not trade with anyone trading with Cuba, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: The most effective way of achieving this dual objective is to bring about a situation whereby the American business community wouldn't trade .
 Cuba has only 6 million people and, as a result, a businessman, contemplating trade with Cuba, will think long and hard before he cuts himself off from the huge American market for the sake of the Cuban market .
 If a couple Latin American countries joined the U.S. effort, the action would be even more effective, he says . The United States is encouraging Latin American nations to join the effort .
 It's conceivable that such action, which is based on the self-interest motive of Free World traders, would make superfluous other steps in this field . It is conceivable that . such action would make unnecessary other steps .
 There appear to be three ways in which we can bring about the situation whereby the American business community would not trade with anyone in the Cuban trade . The U.S. business community should not be involved in the trade with Cuba .
 First, we could invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act to ban Americans from doing business with anyone who trades with Cuba . Then we could use the act to do business with those who trade with Cuba.
 U.S. business community should cut off commercial dealings with persons trading with Cuba, officials say . Second, we could make our desires known to the American business community and urge them to voluntarily cut off business dealings .
 Trade with the Enemy Act could blacklist any foreign firm which trades with Cuba after a certain date . Cuba could also blacklist foreign firms which trade with the Cuban government .
 We would undoubtedly make an exception for those firms which export food and drugs to Cuba since our own traders are allowed to do this . We would also make a special exception to those firms who export food to Cuba .
 A relatively few Free World firms make up a large part of the Free World’s trade with Cuba . It is not worthwhile or effective to blacklist firms which trade in small quantities of noncritical items . We may find that a relatively few . few Free . World firms . make up
 Probably the biggest obstacles to the blacklisting action would be the reaction of Free World governments . Free world governments could be the biggest obstacle to blacklisting the blacklist .
 Free World governments would certainly point to the violation of free trading principles . The U.S. might conceivably retaliate against United States exporters . Free world governments might point out the violation .
 Cuba is forced into two-way trade involuntarilybecause of the world-wide shortage of sugar . They would undoubtedly point out that they are forced to . point out they are . forced into . two-ways Cuban trade .
 "There are overriding national security considerations in this case," the White House says . "We also believe in the principles of free trade," he says .
 Cuban actions in autumn, 1962 and Cubas recent participation in fomenting subversion in Venezuela, Panama, and Zanzibar make it eminently clear that we are dealing with a particularly nasty, hostile power . The U.S. intends to treat Cuba as one
 "We have tried strenuously over the past few years to gain Free World cooperation through persuasion rather than sanction," says British Foreign Secretary George Osborne .
 Free World exports to Cuba only amounted to a little more than $100 million in each of the last two years .
 No one, except Cuba, is going to hurt very much, even if Cuban sugar is paid for in foreign exchange . Cuba is paying for its own sugar in exchange for its sugar .
 There may be a variety of factors which may mitigate a vociferous response by affected Free World governments . There may also be a number of factors that may mitigate the response .
 Cuba is accustomed to our "extreme" behavior when it comes to Cuba, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Cuba is "pretty accustomed to their ""extreme"" behavior," he says .
 We have been hounding Free World governments about the subject for a long time now; they will probably be only half-surprised when we finally do something decisive about it. Second, we have been . The Free World has been hounded about the issue for years; it is
 Third, no Free World country will suffer if it cuts itself off from Cuban trade . No Free World countries will suffer in real terms, says CNN.com.com's John Sutter .
 Fourth, Free World governments who sympathize with our objectives but who are unable to control their traders effectively, may welcome action which takes the ball out of their hands . Free world governments may secretly welcome action that takes them out of control .
 American business firms are unlikely to resist the proposed action . U.S. business firms will not resist the proposal .
 There are some arguments in favor of taking action quickly if we are going to take it . There are also some arguments to take action quickly .
 Venezuela, Panama, Zanzibar, and Guantanamo generate atmosphere, says CNN's John Sutter .
 OAS may act before OAS discusses Rio Treaty action against Cuba because of arms cache discovery . Second, we might want to act before the Rio Treaty talks are held .
 Third, there are indications that Free World/Cuban trade has hit bottom and is beginning to rise . Free World and Cuban trade is likely to hit bottom .
 The longer we wait, the more resistance we are likely to meet as vested interests increase along with the trade . The longer it is possible to meet with vested interests in the trade, it is likely to become more difficult .

 There have been major compromises of our efforts to reduce trade between the free world and Cuba, the U.S. says . Counter-Measures against Free-World Economic Ties with Cuba have been compromised .
 These breaches have made it clear that our present tactics of relying essentially on diplomatic persuasion are not adequate . It is clear that this is not the best way of dealing with the situation .

 A variety of partial measures, either singly or together, could include a denial of government contracts to traders with Cuba and private boycotts . The measures would be combined with a variety of measures, such as a boycott .
 A significant amount of trade between Cuba and the free world would occur despite the establishment of a proclaimed list . The action would almost certainly be much more effective than any other measure or combination of measures we might employ .
 The fundamental question regarding a proclaimed list is whether we are prepared to endure the very real political costs that would result from its establishment and whether we would also be prepared to incur the risk of retaliation that might be directed against either United States commercial interests or the government .
 The concession of the waiver will encourage Spanish-Cuban trade, but beyond that other free-world countries will exploit the waiver to justify their own economic activities toward Cuba . The concession will encourage trade between Spain and Cuba .

 The choice is complicated by the negative effects of the conclusion of the agreement on the . agreement on air and sea transportation between the OAS countries and Cuba, Cuba .
 Our present tactics of relying on diplomatic persuasion, reinforced by pressures on free-world firms trading with Cuba by their American associates, have not prevented major breaches in our efforts to isolate Cuba .
 Key free-world governments have flatly refused to cooperate with our policy, even when approached at the highest level, and we are suffering successive losses . Key free world governments are flatly refusing to cooperate, says the minister .
 Cuban-free-world trade is a key part of the U.S. trade embargo, says U.N. ambassador to Cuba . Trade with Cuba or trade with the United States must be made to choose between trade with Cuba and trade with United States .
 In 1963 Cuban exports to the free world may have amounted to about $190 million, while imports were probably about $115 million, a total of around $300 million . In 1963 the Cuban trade was estimated to be worth about $200 million .
 Cuba increased its foreign exchange holdings from about $20 million to approximately $75100 million in 2013 . Cuba also increased its currency holdings from $20 billion to $75 billion in 2014 . Cuba's foreign currency holdings increased to $100 million .
 Cuba maintains sugar exports to the free world at about 1. million metric tons; 2.million metric tons . Cuba maintains about 1 million tons of sugar exports .
 Cuba exports about $10 million worth of other commodities to the free world; 4.5 million of them to the U.S. Cuba exports $10.6 million of other products to the world . Cuba also exports $1.2 billion of other Cuban-American commodities .
 Cuba finances imports from the free world out of current export earnings; 6.5% of its imports are from the U.S. Cuba finances its imports from free world from current export sales; 6% from its own export earnings .
 Cuba’s exports to and imports from the free world would each amount to about $260 million . Cubas export to and imported from the world would amount to $520 million, an increase 75 percent over 1963 .
 A decrease in sugar prices or Cuban inability to export as much as 1 million tons of sugar to the free world could lower the export earnings and perhaps the total trade figure .
 Cuba’s imports from and total trade with the free world could use above the $260 million and $520 million estimates . On the other hand, if free-world suppliers were willing to extend large-scale credits to Cuba, then Cubas imports could use the credits
 Much depends, of course, on how Cuba allocates its foreign exchange holdings and how wisely it employs the goods it does import . With respect to the impact that any increase in free world-Cuban trade would have on the Cuban economy, much depends on how Cuban allocates foreign exchange
 A conservative assessment, however, would have to assume increasing Cuban competence in such matters . The Cuban government has been criticized for its lack of transparency in Cuba .
 Significantly increased imports of commodities critical to the Cuban economy could provide the crucial margin between a wallowing economy and one showing satisfactory growth .
 "as you requested"" covering memorandum of February 26 . Drafted by Chase and forwarded to Bundy attached to Bundy .
 This represents roughly a 60% reduction from the 1962 level of Free World shipping to Cuba . This is roughly 60% less than the Free World Shipping to Cuba in 1962 .
 A Lebanese law is expected to become effective in mid-March which should eliminate many Lebanese ships during 1964 . Lebanese law expected to eliminate many ships from 1964 .
 A United States deal with the biggest shipper in the British trade is expected to result in a substantial reduction in British ships by the end of 1964 . We have made very little headway with HMG, but a U.S. deal is expected .
 The shipping figures in 1964 should be even lower than in 1963 . This assumes that we can prevent other Free World ships from picking up the slack . Greeks, Lebanese, and Mavroleon are expected to leave .
 In October 1962, Free World scheduled services to and from Cuba consisted of 20 flights per week, operated by four carriers . Free World operated flights to Cuba in October 1962 .
 Cubana flight operated between Mexico City and Havana . Canadian cargo service operated once a week between Montreal and Havana. Cubana service operated between Canada and Cuba .
 Free World non-scheduled operations to Havana were also scheduled . Cuba was a major hub for Cuba in the 1960s .
 At present there is only one Free World scheduled service to Havana . Air Iberia operates between Madrid and Havana once a week .
 Cubana still operates its flights to Mexico and is now also operating, twice a month, to Madrid . Cubana also operates flights to the Spanish capital .
 Other non-scheduled operations to Havana have been substantially reduced . The U.S. has also reduced its flights to Havana .
 OAS action will result in the cutting-off of the Havana/Mexico City air link . Hopefully, the Venezuelan arms cache discovery will lead to an end of Havana-Mexico Air link .
 This will put another crimp in Castros efforts to bring Latin Americans to Cuba for subversive training . Castros efforts will be hampered by this, he says .
 In 1958, Cubas total trade with the Free World amounted to $1.2 billion . Cubas trade with Free World was $1 billion . In 1958 the Cuban government was in full control of Cuba’s economic situation .
 Of this, about $1 billion was trade with the U.S. while about $500 million with other Free World countries . About $1billion was trade between the U., while $500million was trade in the other countries .
 Free World trade with Cuba fell about 50% from 1958 levels to about $200$250 million . In 1962, U.S. exports to Cuba were roughly $115 million while imports from Cuba were about $120 million .
 Estimates indicate that when all the statistics are in, Free World trade with Cuba in 1963 will amount to roughly $250$320 million . Exports to Cuba are expected to remain the same at roughly $115 million while imports are expected .
 A table is attached which shows the primary Free World traders in 1962 and 1963 . A table was attached to the table showing the main Free World trade routes .
 Total Free World trade with Cuba could amount to roughly $520 million, an increase of nearly 75% over 1963 .
 The value of Free World/Cuba trade in 1964 could be less than $520 million . For example, if sugar prices drop below the estimated 8¢ per pound, then the value of the trade could be $520million .
 The value of Free World/Cuba trade in 1964 could be more than $520 million if Free World countries extend large-scale credits to Cuba, or if Bloc decides to give foreign exchange to Cuba for purchases in the Free World .
 President Johnson commented briefly on Cuban relations during a long telephone call that he placed to Senator Russell on February 26, 1964 .
 He thinks were in worse shape than we’ve been in 20 years and that the Hemisphere is in a very dangerous position . He thinks that the hemisphere is in an extremely dangerous position. He says that the world is in danger .
 He thinks that these two little insignificant moves have let them know that . ‘Don’t tread on me.’ he says . But he thinks that . these two insignificant moves . have let . them know . that they . know that dont tread
 Castro talked about wanting to turn the water back on at Guantanamo, Johnson says . Johnson says Castro talked during one of his interviews about wanting the water at Guantanamo . Johnson: Castro said he wants to turn back the water in Guantanamo .
 "Whenever I hit the Department of Defense or the State, its like a man trying to punch his way through a big thick mattress," he says .
 The portions of the conversation printed here were prepared in the Office of the Historian specifically for this volume . The conversation was prepared specifically for the volume .
 Discussion with the President at 1:00 o�clock, February 26th; No one was present 5.5.5 .
 I said there was a high probability that the SAM sites would be placed in the hands of the Cubans who would have absolute control over them . The SAM sites are located in Cuba and are believed to be under control of Cuba .
 I said that other evidence convinced us there would be a continuing withdrawal of Soviets from Cuba, but not a total withdrawal . However we could not gauge the exact numbers of the Soviet withdrawal .
 I said that this, in my opinion, represented probably the next important crisis that we would face . Castro in his rather amicable but long press conference had raised the question of our penetrating illegally Cuban air space, he said .
 I therefore recommended that this subject be discussed with Secretaries of State and Defense; that they be ordered to prepare contingency plans for such a situation . Otherwise, all the lights in town would be on, and our course of action would have to evolve under an atmosphere of emergency .
 The President asked if I had discussed it with McNamara and Rusk and I told him I had, on two occasions, but they seemed wholly preoccupied with the problem at hand . McNamara, Rusk, and McNamara were "preoccupied" with the issue, he said
 The President gave me no satisfactory answer as to any action he would take. The President did not give me a satisfactory answer, I said .
 In fact, he seemed more preoccupied with the withdrawal of Soviets and the ""numbers remaining"" than he did with the issue he was confronting him with .
 In total, roughly 1000 commuters have either left the Base or have exiled themselves . 1220 commuters remain to be handled .
 If and when we give notice to this group, we estimate that roughly 40% will exile themselves . We estimate that about 40% of the group will be exiled from the country .
 As you may recall, about ten days ago I told DOD that we wanted the commuter reduction gently pushed through to zero . We want to see commuter reduction reduced to zero. We want it pushed through, but it's not going to happen .
 A DOD contact confidentially tells me that he is skeptical that DOD will continue the reduction without a high-level push from the White House . While the Navy prepared a reduction plan at our request, Secretary McNamara appears to be holding it up . The Navy is also holding up a reduction
 The Secretary has taken personal charge of the matter and may not want to carry the reduction beyond 1000 commuters . The President and the Secretary apparently agreed upon originally, at the time of the water crisis .
 The Secretary may be under pressure from the Navy, which argues that a further reduction of commuters high-lights the erosion of our position in Guantanamo . The release of faithful employees is a tough moral, humanitarian problem, and gives Castro propaganda ammunition .
 President and Secretary McNamara are on different wavelengths, you may want to bring up the issue at lunch Tuesday .
 This paragraph is double lined in the left-hand margin and a notation in Chases handwriting on page 1 reads ""See 2,"" referring to paragraph 4 . Chases handwriting is on page 2, with a notation that reads "See 2"
 I still favor the reduction to zero. While this is an evenly balanced case, I must say that I still want to reduce it to zero .
 As long as Castro can turn off or turn on the workers at will, the chances are better than even that, for one reason or another, he will tweak our nose in this respect before the year is out . The chances are that Castro will tweak his nose before the end of the
 "We will be faced with the same kind of head-line situation that we faced when he turned off the water," he says . And we will be . faced with . the same sort of head line situation that . we faced in the water, he adds .
 The time and place of the meeting are from the Presidents Daily Diary . The President�¼s daily diary is published by President Barack Obama .
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting with the President on March 4, 1964 on Cuba, Vietnam and various related subjects . The meeting took place in Washington, D.C. and New York .
 Joint Chiefs of Staff briefed on operational plans on Cuba . Joint Chiefs discussed the various time factors involved in the operation .
 The Chiefs emphasized that one of the factors is shipping and that the longest time element involves getting troops from Fort Hood to the East Coast and the Marines from the West Coast .
 Much questioning by the President concerned the strategy involved and the various possibilities . Much questioning was also asked by President Obama .
 President ordered Joint Chiefs to give him a list of everything they think we can do that we are not now doing to put further pressure on Cuba . The Joint Chiefs made the list, made up by themselves, of everything the Joint Chiefs think they can do .
 In the discussion of Cuba there was mention of a joint resolution by Congress . Congress would give the President a quasi-legal position for expanding the efforts .
 Castro's training of Cuban and Communist agitators and exporting them to other countries, he says . Castro is posing a long-range threat to the stability and security of Latin America, he adds .
 "On these grounds, he was posing a new threat which people around the world could recognize," he said . "He was posing an ... new threat," he added .
 Discussion of this resolution was not terminated precisely, but the Presidential reaction appeared to be included in his discussion and reaction to the proposal of a joint resolution by Congress .
 The Cuban discussion also led to a discussion of the difference between a quarantine and a real blockade, including halting of Russian shipping, and especially the stoppage of petroleum ships . The discussion led to discussion of a quarantine which we held in October 1962 .
 Joint Chiefs should discuss the possibility in conjunction with everything we can do that we are not doing that we're not doing . It was indicated that the Joint Chiefs would discuss this possibility .
 President asked Joint Chiefs to give him military advice in the form of two lists of action that could be taken, one for Cuba and one for Southeast Asia . President was willing to accept their judgments, and, in a sense, was setting out upon this course of activity .
 In turn, the President expected their 100% support of the actions agreed upon and a cessation of forecasting and discussing in public what we intend to do . The President is expected to receive 100% of the support .
 Eisenhower would have succeeded if everything we were planning had been discussed by government officials, including State Department and military officials, before they even staged the landings . He emphasized this point with the comparison to Normandy operation .
 V Clifton was a Major General, USA Military Aide to the President . Print from a copy that bears this typed signature .
 Intelligence report: Castro thought of shooting down U2 plane in retaliation for fishing boat attack . CIA: Castro heard about the fishing boat incident, thought of doing it in retaliation .
 This report underlines the fact that the surface-to-air missiles in Cuba are coming increasingly under Cuban and not Russian control . There is therefore a need to take measures to warn Castro and his Russian friends once more on the dangers of interference with our regular high-level surveillance .
 I therefore suggest that you may wish to sign the attached memorandum to the Secretary of State /3/ asking for a diplomatic scenario aimed at strengthening our position .
 On March 4 McCone sent an intelligence report to Bundy, Rusk, and McNamara that reported that Castro, in his rage over the fishing vessels incident, considered firing a missile at a U2 plane as it overflew Cuba, but instead cut off the water supply
 Recent intelligence reports indicate that Castro may have an itchy finger on the trigger of the surface-to-air missiles in Cuba . The Cuban president may have itchy fingers on the triggers of the missiles .
 "It seems to be very important that we take every possible step to warn both the Cubans and their Soviet friends of the risk involved in any interference with our high-level surveillance," says Obama .
 "I would be glad if the Department would promptly prepare a plan for appropriate, strong, high-level warnings on this point," he says .
 Letter from the Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division of the Central Intelligence Agency to the President�s Special Assistant for National Security Affairs .
 Dick Helms and I are most appreciative of the opportunity you gave us this morning for a thorough discussion of the Agency’s various operational problems in connection with Cuba . Dick and Richard Helms were on the panel to discuss Cuba .
 "It was very helpful to us and has served to clarify our own thinking on the future of our various operational programs," says the Air Force .
 It might perhaps be well to set forth, in this informal fashion, a list of the various topics which we discussed together with the . considerations that appear to . apply, it might perhaps . apply to me to apply .
 The Agency appears as the proposer of most covert action programs at the Special Group and elsewhere . We do this only in response to what we understand to be policy requirements . We have no interest in either commencing or perpetuating any programs which are not demanded by policy .
 The resulting program represented a maximum covert effort but only a minimum overall national effort which could result in overthrowing Castro . The resulting covert effort was a minimum of covert effort to overthrow Castro .
 The percentage of chance of achieving this purpose was admittedly never too high even had the program proceeded on full blower .
 The economic part of the program suffered a serious, if not fatal, reverse with the Leyland bus contract . European suppliers to take advantage of Castros improved cash position .
 The sabotage raids were built into the program as a sort of firing pin for internal unrest and to create the conditions for a coup, which was to be the main force leading to Castros defeat, ran only from August to December .
 The effectiveness of these five raids is certainly debatable; there are strong proponents on both sides of the argument . The effectiveness is debatable, but the effectiveness of the raids has been debatable .
 Five rather low-key raids followed by the present three-month hiatus, the latter clearly noted by proand anti-Castroites alike, adds up to a program of a much smaller dimension than originally envisioned . Regardless of how that debate might come out, however, it adds up
 At the present time, as a result of a number of circumstances well known to you, Castro is in a strong upswing . The spirit of resistance within Cuba is at a very low point indeed, says President Obama .
 "In my estimation, a covert program at this time designed to overthrow Castro is not realistic," says Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: In his estimation, the covert program designed to oust Castro is "not realistic"
 Acceptance of risks and noise level of a greater magnitude than we had in mind in June would be needed to stand a chance in view of the developments since last June . Acceptance is needed for a greater level of noise level and risk to be taken seriously .
 This then raises the question of what should happen now to the various bits and pieces of the June program . The June program will be released on June 1 .
 I would like to mention these separately and refer to some of the considerations typical to each. I would also mention some of these considerations .
 The sabotage raids are conducted by Cuban exile groups held and trained in Florida and entirely subject to our planning and control . The raids were conducted by Cuba exile groups, according to the Cuban government .
 To place them in position and recover them there requires an extensive maritime apparatus in Florida, which also serves intelligence agent infiltrations and exfiltrations .
 To maintain the raiding capability on a stand-by basis is expensive but, more importantly, the raiding groups themselves have a relatively short shelf life . If not employed their morale deteriorates and some of the members, usually the best motivated, drop out .
 Replacements can be acquired and trained but their caliber and morale is in large part determined by the morale of the exile community as a whole . Replacements may be acquired but morale of exile community will determine their effectiveness .
 We probably can retain the present raiding groups at roughly their current capabilities for another month or two, although the well-known Cuban volatility is capable of causing sudden and more rapid deterioration .
 In short, we will need to know within a reasonable time whether we should continue to effect repairs to and keep in being our sabotage raiding apparatus . We will also need to decide whether to continue to work on the project .
 The dismemberment of these raiding teams could be accomplished without too much shock to the exile community . The dismembered raiding teams are expected to be able to leave the country without shock .
 It would be noticed, but, if done carefully, particularly if it coincided with the commencement of ""autonomous"" operations, it should not cause undue repercussions and polemics against United States policy .
 As part of the June plan, we are supporting two ""autonomous"" exile groups headed respectively by Manuel Artime and Manolo Ray . The government is supporting two "autonomous" exile groups .
 "In both cases we have gone to maximum lengths to preserve the deniability of United States complicity in the operation," says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 Artime has required a good deal of hand-feeding although still within the context of deniability . Artime now possesses the greater mechanical and paramilitary apparatus, which he now possesses .
 He will probably not be ready for operations against Cuba before April or May of this year . He will be ready to launch operations against the island nation .
 He possesses most of his hardware and maritime equipment and has negotiated geographical and political bases in Central America . He possesses a range of weapons and equipment .
 He does not possess the physical accoutrements that Artime has and is probably not as well equipped in terms of professional planning . He is not as good as Artime .
 Ray has a better political image inside Cuba among supporters of the revolution . Ray has recently acquired, according to reports, some of the other leftwing exile activist groups such as Gutierrez Menoyo .
 He is said to be ready to move into Cuba on a clandestine basis late this spring . He is expected to arrive in Cuba late this year .
 His first weapon will be sabotage inside Cuba, apparently not externally-mounted hit-and-run raids . "His first weapon is sabotage," he says. "He will be trying to sabotage Cuba, not just hit-on raids"
 If U.S. policy should demand that the ""autonomous"" operations be suspended, we could of course cut off our support immediately .
 Both groups are based outside the United States and our only real leverage on them is through our financial support . withdrawal of this support would probably be fatal to their operations in time, says the U.S.
 A cutoff of this support, even though this support has been untraceable in a technical sense, would have a considerable impact within the exile community . A cutoff would have significant impact on the community within exile community, he says .
 The collapse of the only remaining evidence of exile action against Castro would hit the exile community hard . U.S. support is rumored, especially in the case of Artime, is rumored .
 The exile of today, however, appears to have lost much of his fervor and, in any case, does not seem to have the capacity for causing domestic trouble which he had a year or two ago .
 The Central American countries in which the exile bases exist would be greatly confused, although we have carefully never indicated to the governments of these countries any more than U.S. sympathy for the ""autonomous"" groups .
 We have a capacity, which is increasing, to sabotage Cuban merchant ships calling at foreign ports, says Cuban President Vladimir Putin . We have capacity to sabotage ships, says Putin .
 We are emphasizing in this program the more subtle forms of sabotage as against large explosions obviously stemming from agent-placed bombs and limpets . We emphasize subtle forms, such as small explosions .
 The Cuban merchant fleet, among the most badly run in the world, can be helped along to a measurable degree by this program . The program will help the country's merchant fleet in the future .
 On the economic warfare front, as you know, we have for many months conducted a covert denial program based on limited capabilities directed at very narrow targets . The U.S. has been conducting covert denial programs for years .
 The effectiveness of this program is dependent on the careful selection of items to be denied in terms of their critical value to a key element of the Cuban economy, says the Cuban government .
 Despite the collapse of the U.S. overall economic denial program against Cuba, we still retain the capacity, using unofficial and covert methods, to hurt but obviously not to destroy certain bits of the Cuban economy .
 This effort can be complemented by carefully concealed contamination of lubricants, lubricants and similar actions . This is not the only way to get around the world .
 Our program to get in touch with and subvert members of the military establishment and other elite groups in Cuba continues .
 Its chance of success rises and falls with the state of morale inside Cuba as influenced by the success or inactivity of our other programs and the U.S. posture in general . The chances of success naturally rise and falls, says the Cuban government .
 It will be affected by anti-Castro morale but we believe that we can offset the effects of further deterioration in this morale by increasingly tightened and efficient operations .
 We are seeking your advice to know which of the above lines of actions we should continue, which we should try to retain as a shelf capability and which to abandon, we ask .
 As separate pieces they can serve to exert some braking effect on Castro's progress, but that is about all . As parts of an integrated national program, they seemed to make sense, but not all . They seemed to be designed to have a fighting chance to get rid of Castro .
 Warnings to Cubans and Russians about SAMs should be given to deter SAM firings at our U2s over Cuba . I refer to the Presidents memo to the Secretary 2 requesting that warnings be given .
 State completed a package for the President�s approval of the bill . John Crimmins tells me that, a couple days ago, State completed the package for Presidents approval .
 The Secretary signed off and intended to bring the matter up at the luncheon meeting with the President on Tuesday;4 reportedly, he did not do so because other people were present .
 The State paper recommends that we send a warning note to the Cubans only . We would send it through the Czech Embassy so that the Russians would be sure to see it. The State recommends that .
 Tommy Thompson feels that we should not send a warning note directly to the Russians . Tommy Thompson: We should not be sending a warning letter directly to Russia . Thompson: Russia is the only nation in the world to send such a warning .
 The U.S. should do whatever is most likely to restrain the Cubans from shooting down a U2. It is hard to comment without seeing the State package, but his preliminary view is that the general guiding principle in this case must be that we should .
 Castro scares me because I think he is a man who can regard a threat as credible but still disregard the consequences if his honor and emotion are involved . The upcoming OAS action may be just the sort of thing which will rile him next . Castro scares him because he's a man
 When the Russians regard a threat as credible, they appear likely to act accordingly . On the other hand, when the Russian regard a credible threat, they will act accordingly, writes Andrew Hammond .
 Khrushchev, after all, has real leverage over Castro, he says . In short, I believe that we are most likely to prevent a shoot-down if our note to Castro is buttressed by a good strong pitch from Khrushvic to Castro .
 If Tommy Thompson’s indirect approach to the Russians is most likely to result in a strong Khrushchev pitch to Castro, then I am for it . Thompson's indirect approach will most likely lead to a strong appeal to the Russian leader . Thompson: "If Tommy Thompson
 If we are more likely to get the most effective Khrushchev pitch by sending a stiff note directly to the Russians, then other arguments, against sending a note to Russia, should be very powerful .
 Warning to Cubans and Soviets Against Interference with our Aerial Surveillance of Cuba 1. Warning to Cuban and Soviet Union against interference with our aerial surveillance .
 I recommend that the warning to the Cubans and Soviets against interfering with our overflights of Cuba, which you requested in your memorandum of March 6, 1964, be done in the form of a note to the Cuban Government .
 By using this method and channel we can't be sure that the Soviets will also get the message . We can't incurring the disadvantage of making a special, direct approach to them .
 There is enclosed for your consideration of your consideration and approval the text of a proposed note .
 The late President Kennedy and I on various occasions made public statements following the missile crisis in Cuba . President Kennedy said that in the absence of inspection on the ground would maintain surveillance flights over Cuba .
 Cuban gunners had orders to fire at any foreign war plane that makes low-altitude flights over Cuban territory . Cuban Government stepped up preparations to shoot any foreign plane that violated Cuban air space .
 The Czech Republic sent a reply to the Cubans through the Czechs . The Czechs said they reminded the Cuban Government of its position on air surveillance .
 "We considered sending the note through the Czechs tantamount to notifying the Soviets of our position. We considered sending it through the . Czechs considered it as a . form of notifying . Soviets of their position .
 In recent months Fidel Castro has repeatedly alluded to violation of Cuban air space by U.S. aircraft . Castro has also alluded to the violation of Cuba's air space .
 The most forthright of his statements was made in a press conference with foreign newsmen on February 6, 1964 .
 The foregoing statement, made in the context of the fishing boat incident, gives us a good occasion for sending a warning to the Cubans on the overflights .
 The Czech Ambassador will send a routine reply to the Cubans, via the Czech Ambassador, on their notes concerning various aspects of the fishing boat incident and Guantanamo . We would use the same occasion to deliver the same warning note .
 By sending the note through the Czech Ambassador we can be sure that it will reach the Soviets . By sending it through the . Czech ambassador we can . be sure it will . reach the . Soviets .
 This will avoid our having to make a special, direct approach to the Soviets on this matter, which could be counterproductive in that the Soviets would feel compelled to respond and thus commit themselves more formally in ways they may otherwise desire to avoid . The Soviets may otherwise want to commit themselves in ways
 The State memorandum2 is not fully responsive to the President�s request, which was for ""a plan for appropriate, strong, highlevel warnings"" on interference with our high-level surveillance over Cuba, the White House said .
 There are several ""open"" circuits in Washington other than a State Department typewriter .
 The warning should not be given in a note to the Cubans through the Czechs or even to the Russians, a. a. note should be given . The warning is not only given to Cubans but also to Czechs and the Russians .
 A note calls for a reply from Castro which can only be unsatisfactory . b. Castro's response is unsatisfactory. A note from Castro calls for an apology from Castro .
 "A note is a formal challenge in an area where we have been living under a tacit non-interference agreement," the mayor says . A note is "a formal challenge" in the area, he says .
 All the draft note does substantively is to remind Castro of this fact . c. c. The draft note is only a reminder of Castro’s role in Cuba .
 The importance of non-interference of our surveillance is such that it should not be mixed up with the fishing boat and Guantanamo incidents . The importance should be not be confused with the Guantanamo incidents, says President Obama .
 The State memorandum proposes the warning note be delivered along with routine replies to notes about these incidents . It also proposes a routine reply to the notes .
 The Russians should continue to be held responsible for Castro�s conduct in connection with those aspects of the Cuba missile crisis which are still with us . The Russians are still responsible for those aspects, the author says .
 Khrushchev’s failure to get Castro to accept on-site inspection in Cuba . Our surveillance arises out of Khrushvic�s failed to get Cuba to accept inspections in Cuba.
 The fact that the Russians may be turning over ""control"" of the SAM sites to the Cubans does not relieve the Russians of their responsibility to ensure that these SAMs are not used against the United States reconnaissance planes .
 Established channels used during the missile crisis should be used again to convey a strong, informal, direct warning, i.e., Tommy Thompson to the Russian Ambassador here . Tommy Thompson should use the same channels as during the crisis .
 Castro’s statement could be used as a peg on which to hang a reminder to the Russians that for us the surveillance of Cuba is an issue involving the USSR . As the controlling power they are responsible for their satellites use of the weapon .
 If the Russians deny responsibility for controlling Castro’s use of the SAM sites, or acknowledge that they have no capability to control these weapons now that they are being operated by Cuba, we are in immediate need of some serious planning .
 As to recommendation 2 of the State memorandum, i.e., getting word to Castro through ""black"" channels, I am at a complete loss to understand what purpose would be served . I'm not sure what purpose will be served by this recommendation, but I think it would be useful
 To tell Castro that we would like nothing better than to have him shoot down one of our surveillance flights so we could retaliate is to issue the kind of challenge that even a rational Latin has difficulty turning down .
 Alexis Johnson has discussed with me your views on notification to the Soviets of our attitude toward a possible Cuban shoot-down of a U2 after the Cubans assume control of the SAM sites .
 Even an informal approach will prompt a reply from the Soviets, says author . Cubans have every right to defend their sovereignty over their air space, he says .
 The important thing is that if the Cubans do shoot down a U2, we will want to treat our retaliatory action as a purely United States/Cuban affair . "The important thing, in my view, is that we will treat this as an entirely United States
 This would be harder to do if we were on prior notice from the Soviets that they would support the Cubans in their defense of their sovereignty, which is a possible Soviet response to any direct approach on our part .
 The Soviets will have had some understanding with the Cubans about their use of the SAMs, says Peter Bergen . He says he feels confident that before turning over the SAM, the Soviets had an understanding with them .
 If the Cubans should shoot down a plane without prior agreement with the Soviets, I think it quite possible that the Soviets would not, while making fierce noises, would not support them . The Soviets would use the violation of their understanding as an excuse for not doing so, he says .
 At your meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 4, 1964, /2/ you directed them to concentrate their attention on possible ways of obtaining greater support from the Organization of American States in carrying out a program .
 You asked that they examine additional ways of bringing pressure on Castro beyond those currently authorized . Also asked they examine ways to bring pressure upon Castro beyond that presently authorized .
 The U.S. should secure broad authority for a wide range of actions under Article 8 of the Rio Treaty, including the possible use of armed force against Cuba . OAS members, individually or collectively, deem such action necessary to prevent further intervention and aggression by Castro .
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff have studied the text of the proposed OAS resolution which the United States has suggested that the Venezuelan Government propose for the consideration of the OAS member states . With these possible objectives for OAS action in mind, the Joint Chiefs have studied .
 'For the time being, they have nothing additional to suggest in this field. Hence, for the . time being . there are no further suggestions in this . field .
 With regard to measures designed to put additional pressure on Castro beyond those presently authorized, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend a resumption of the program /3/ involving the employment of covert assets to conduct interdependent operations against Cuba .
 As this program unfolds, they would favor expanding and intensifying it while maintaining a continuing evaluation of the reactions of Castro, the communists, and the Free World . They would like to expand and intensify it while evaluating the reaction of Castro .
 A hard-line propaganda campaign would estrange the Castro regime from the Cuban people and the rest of the Free World, the U.S. says .
 Officials have difficulty identifying promising actions against Castro which have not been previously considered, and tried, in some cases .
 It is a hard fact that little remains which offers promise of real effectiveness in removing Castro short of a blockade or an ascending scale of military action .
 Under Secretary of State George W Ball spoke before the North Atlantic Council in Paris on March 23, 1964 . Ball's speech was an important statement on U.S. policy toward Cuba during the Johnson Presidency .
 Ball: Cuba created a beachhead of communism in a very vulnerable but important part of the world . Ball: The loss of Cuba to communism was a loss not just to the United States, with its long and particularly close ties to that country .
 Ball stated that the U.S. regarded Cuba as a subversive threat, not a military threat . Ball said that the United States considered Cuba a threat not military one .
 He highlighted the aggressive and subversive nature of Castroism, the non-negotiability to the United States of Castros political, economic, and military dependence on the Soviet Union . The objectives of the U.S. and OAS economic denial programs, he said, are
 The latter were limited to lessening Castro’s will and ability to export subversion and violence, he said . Castroism could not serve Cuban and Latin American peoples that Castroism had no future in the Western Hemisphere .
 Ball said that Latin America would be rendered ""immune to Communist infection only by amelioration of the conditionspolitical, economic, and socialin which subversion flourishes"
 The United States and the free nations of Latin America have, therefore, through the Alliance for Progress, have undertaken a major collective effort to transform the structure and production of the region . The Alliance of Progress aims to transform Latin America's structure .
 The central issue is whether member governments of the Western Alliance should take positive action to en620 Foreign Relations, 19641968, Volume XXXII . The West should not have to take risks by taking risks that commercial bankers are unwilling to take .
 Ambassador Finletter reported that Balls presentation ""drew so much support that UK decided best not to speak at all" In telegram Polto 1138 from Paris, March 23, said that Ball’s presentation drew so much support .
 The UK does not agree that its trade policies should be custom tailored and designed to differentiate among Communist countries in accordance with conditions and behaviour of individual countries .
 On March 6 we sent the Secretary of State a memorandum asking for a strong plan to warn ""the Cubans and their Soviet friends" against any interference with our high-level surveillance in Cuba .
 The Department has now come back with a plan which is intelligent as far as it goes. The Department of Public Health has come up with a new plan .
 In essence it is that we should send a diplomatic warning to the Cubans by way of the Czechs, /2/ and follow this up by certain covert statements which will reach Cuban ears and show that we are entirely serious . The Czechs should be sent to Cuba by the way
 The Department thinks we should not go straight to the Russians, and after discussing the matter with Ambassador Thompson, /3/ I now find his arguments persuasive. The Department of State says it's not necessary to go directly to the Russian .
 I do think that one further element is neededand that is an appropriate public warning from you at some appropriate timeperhaps in answer to a question at an early press conference perhaps in an appropriate time’s .
 CIA is providing financial and some technical support to two autonomous Cuban exile groups . The groups are headed respectively by Manuel Ray and Manuel Artime . As part of the covert program authorized in June 1963, CIA provided financial and technical support .
 In our judgment, Artime and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Ray, now possess the hardware and maritime equipment as well as the geographical and political bases in Central America needed to launch independent infiltration and sabotage operations against Cuba .
 The possibility of imminent unilateral operations is brought to the attention of the Special Group at this time since it is related to the question of the future of CIAcontrolled sabotage and harassment operations now under review by higher authority .
 withdrawal of U.S. financial aid and moral support would probably be fatal to their operations in time . withdrawal of United States financial aid would probably kill their operations . They are likely to make strenuous efforts to find other sources of support .
 In desperation, the U.S. would probably feel compelled to launch one or more dramatic raids against Cuba . In so doing and in order to prove their viability to potential supporters, they would, in their desperation, probably, feel compelled .
 Evidence continues to point to an imminent turn-over of the SA2 surface-to-air missile system to the Cubans . We have seen no change since the beginning of the year in the size of the Soviet military establishment .
 We believe there are still about 7,000 Soviet military personnel in Cuba, making allowances for as many as 2,000 more or less .
 The majority of Cubans can and probably will be withdrawn when they complete their SAM training later this month . The majorityperhaps as much as 80 percentcan be withdrawn from the program .
 An advisory and technical assistance group of perhaps one or two thousand will probably remain for some time . The group will remain in the U.S. for now .
 Cubans have been conducting comprehensive air defense drills throughout the island since early February . Cubans are conducting comprehensive drills on the island almost daily basis since February .
 Cubans already assume control of most early warning radar functions . Cubans have already assumed control over most radar functions in Cuba .
 Some of the more sophisticated radar and communications equipment we would not expect the Soviets to turn over has been removed from SAM sites .
 A B Cuba apparently is going to draft about 25,000 men a year for the next three years . With simultaneous discharges, the Cuban force level of about 100,000 probably will not increase much, at least at the outset .
 Our photography, incidentally, has recently shown the enlargement of existing barracks, and the establishment and occupation of fairly extensive tent camps with field kitchens .
 There may be as many as 1,500 Cubans training in bloc countries at present, suggesting that Cuba may be expecting additional Soviet military equipment soon . Cuba may also expect additional Soviet equipment soon, says author .
 Last month Soviet ships carrying otherwise non-military cargos brought in another six of the fast P4 Soviet motor torpedo boats . The ships also brought in some extra surface-to-air missiles and some extra missiles .
 There have been three purely military cargos delivered to Cuba this year, and a fourth is on the way . It is probably carrying vehicles and spare parts .
 One of the earlier ships brought in 12 crated MIG jet fighters, probably as replacements, which are still sitting in crates at San Antonio de los Banos .
 Castro himself has recently been preoccupied with economic matters and with the re-trial of Marcos Rodriguez, an old-line Communist charged with having betrayed student conspirators to the Batista police .
 Castro steered the second trial to center the blame on Rodriguez personally, rather than the party . He headed off a possible purge of the old guard Communists and putting them further in his debt .
 Indications are the 1964 crop will be no bigger than last years 3. million tonspossibly less . The 1964 crop is expected to be around 3 million tons, possibly less .
 B. B. the crop is being adversely affected by labor shortages, by a somewhat lower sugar content in the cane, and by damage to the cane by the mechanical cane loaders .
 Cuban officials are cocky about their economic situation at present, and optimistic over prospects for improvement . In general, however, Cuban officials remain optimistic about prospects for better economic conditions .
 Che Guevara’s gloating remarks at UN Trade and Development Conference in Geneva . Che had gloated remarks at the UN trade and development conference .
 Cubans are convinced they have, as they say, ""broken the back"" of our economic denial effort . The Cubans believe they have broken the back" of the economic denial efforts .
 The Cubans had a balance of about $100 million in convertible currency, largely from sugar sales, at the end of 1963 . The Cuban government had about $200 million of convertible currency in 1963 .
 The sugar agreement Castro negotiated with the Soviet Union on his January visit makes them feel that sugar earnings will continue to increase . Castro negotiated the sugar agreement with the Soviets in January .
 This confidence seems to be reflected in the credit ratings the Cubans are getting . The credit ratings of the Cuban government are also reflected in its credit rating .
 Cuba is becoming a much more attractive market for non-bloc countries, so much so that the Cubans feel they may be in the drivers seat . The Cuban people feel they are in the driving seat .
 Japan used to be Castros biggest single trading partner in the Free World . But last year both exports and imports fell off .
 Cuba tells Japanese firms that unless they trade with Cuba, they must switch business they do in Japan to Western European firms . Havana will feel compelled to switch business it does in Japan from Japan to Europe .
 Defense Department: Secretary McNamara and Deputy Secretary Vance JCS: General Maxwell Taylor CIA: The Director, Messrs. Secretary Rusk, Deputy Under Secretary Johnson, Assistant Secretary Mann, and The Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, Mr Crimmins Defense Department . CIA: Mr Maxwell Taylor .
 Mr Bundy presented to the meeting a memorandum /2/ to guide discussion concerning the Cuban program against Cuba . Bundy presented a memorandum to guide the discussion .
 Covert propaganda to encourage low risk forms of active and passive resistance . The U.S. government has been in touch with the U.K. military for more than a decade .
 Attempts to identify and establish contact with potential dissident elements inside Cuba . Cuba is a nation of Cuba .
 Mr Bundy’s paper recommended continuation of the first five items listed and recommended discussion of the last two . Mr Bundys paper recommends continuation of  the first 5 items listed .
 There was a brief discussion of item during which various methods of economic sabotage were described . There was also a discussion of how to sabotage an item .
 "There was no disposition on the part of those present to interfere with this program. There were no disposition ... to interfere this program," she said. "There were no dispositions on the . part of . those present"
 Secretary Rusk said that we would wish to maintain a clean hands posture while the OAS case is pending . If the Cubans are to misuse the SAMs, the onus to be fully on their backs .
 Secretary Rusk said he suspects the Cuban exiles who actually conduct the raids of possibly wishing to leave fingerprints pointing to U.S. involvement in order to increase that involvement . He said he does not believe that hit-and-run raids are in any event very productive; that they
 Mr Bundy said in the past he had been an advocate of sabotage operations, but in view of the history of the program since June, he had come to the conclusion that it is unlikely to be conducted .
 In explanation he pointed out that the policymakers, each time for good reasons, had turned sabotage operations on and off to such an extent that a program of the type envisioned in the June paper simply does not, in the nature, appear feasible .
 Mr McCone called attention to the paper dated 8 June 1963 /3/ which is the basis of the Agency�s current program against Cuba .
 Five relatively low-key sabotage operations since June 1963 do not in effect constitute a test of the program . The statements quoted from the 8 June paper remain valid .
 There was a surge of anti-Castro sentiment during the fall of 1963, corresponding with the period during which the sabotage raids were conducted, he said . He said that resistance sentiment has now fallen into apathy .
 Mr Bundy said that the five items for which approval is recommended in Mr Bundy’s paper would not have the effect envisioned by the 8 June paper . He said that they might have the . effect of slowing down Castros consolidation of his regime .
 Secretary of State said that part of our problem has to do with the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union is now going through a crisis period, particularly with respect to the Sino-Soviet split .
 Ambassador Thompson said he felt sure that were Ambassador Thompson present at the meeting he would indicate the danger of forcing Khrushchev to take a militant defensive attitude with respect to Cuba .
 Secretary Rusk said that should the Cubans shoot down a U2, raid peaceful shipping off the coast, or should there be a strong OAS resolution, the question of the conduct of sabotage raids could be reconsidered .
 He said he doubted that all seven courses of action combined would result in the overthrow of Castro . He said that he doubts that all of the seven options combined would lead to an overthrow .
 He said he leans away from CIA-conducted raids and towards autonomous operations . He said that he leans towards autonomous raids and away from the CIA .
 He said favorable action by the OAS on proposed paragraph two of the resolution looks like a fifty-fifty chance . He said that at the present time, particularly in the . light of the Brazilian events, favorable action .
 I briefed the President on the present status of autonomous operations, including the fact that Artime is planning to launch his operational program on the 12th of April . I briefed him on the current status of the operation .
 There was some discussion of these plans but no one appeared disposed to try to stop Artime . Artime will be the first time Artime has hosted a live concert in the UK .
 Manolo Ray's plans were not as well known to us, but he had made it clear that he intended to move by May . I said that ManoloRays plans are not as little known as ours .
 The Secretary of Defense said that it was his opinion that the covert program has no present chance of success in terms of upsetting Fidel Castro . Defense Secretary said the program is unlikely to upset Castro .
 He suggested that it might be useful, for reasons which had not been brought out at this meeting, and pointed out that the principal decision to be made was a broader onepresumably what the U.S. attitude should be with respect to Fidel Castro .
 He said he felt that the present raiding assets should be held in being pending resolution of Secretary Rusk’s two points . He said that in the meanwhile the fundamental question should be debated .
 Vance said he agrees with the suggestion of continuing these assets in being but that he believes that the program, if permitted to go forward as planned, would have the advantage of hindering Castro in the consolidation of his power .
 He pointed out that the noise level of the raiding operations had not been very high . The noise level was not very high, he said .
 He would advise resuming raiding operations following the resolution of Secretary Rusks points . He advised resuming raids after the resolution .
 General Taylor said that the Joint Chiefs favor the program in its entirety . The Joint Chiefs said that they believe the program has never been given a fair test .
 Bundy said that the CIA covert program is the only matter to be resolved today . Bundy said negotiations with the British on the economic program and sugar support would be ready for discussion next week .
 Secretary Rusk recommended to the President that we keep the raiding assets in being for the next two months . The question be discussed again following the resolution of OAS events and the Cuban use of the SAM sites .
 Desmond FitzGerald Chief Western Hemisphere Division Attachment Washington, April 8, 1964 . Desmond Fitz-Gerald was the President of the U.S. and Secretary of State of State in 1964 .
 McCone went on to say the real issue to be considered was whether we wished to implement the policy outlined in the 8th June paper .
 McCone said he could envisage such issues as extreme economic distress caused by sharp drop in sugar prices or other external factors arising which might cause Castro great pain and ultimately his downfall .
 In summing up his position McCone stated that the actions looked upon, that is, intelligence gathering, propaganda, and surreptitious acts against Cuban ships would not accomplish the stated objectives .
 A meeting was held at 1015 on 9 April with Desmond FitzGerald and Richard Helms to discuss the problem of independent action by Cuban emigre groups headed by Manuel Artime and Manolo Ray .
 Mr FitzGerald said he did not believe any verbal dissuasion had any chance of success with Artime in his determination to mount an operation from Central America .
 Those present agreed that it was possible to block the operation by an air-sea search and by the use of a U.S. Navy destroyer . But that this was a drastic step, they said .
 Mr Helms pointed out that this could write finis to use of Cuban emigre groups and would radiate considerable fallout .
 Bundy says an Artime attack would give the U.S. a hypocritical image . The United States was plumping for votes at the OAS to outlaw subversion and armed attack . Bundy said he was worried that an Artimes attack would be hypocritical .
 He said he wanted to be clear as to whether higher authority fully grasped the implications of the autonomous exile group activity as discussed at Tuesdays meeting .
 Bundy felt it would be extremely useful to regularly publicize Castroite guerrilla activity in Argentina and Central America as a contrasting backdrop to possible Castro slurs against Cuban exile activity .
 Drafted by the Deputy Director of the Office of Soviet Affairs, David Henry, on April 22 and approved in S on May 2 . Drafted in March, approved in May 2.
 The memorandum is part III of III; parts I and II concerned the site of the new Soviet Embassy building and Laos . The memorandum was part of the series of letters to the Soviet Embassy .
 The Secretary Anatoliy F Dobrynin, Soviet Ambassador David Henry, Deputy Director, SOV . After a discussion of the other subjects, the Secretary raised the matter of Cuba . The Secretary of the Soviet Ambassador was present .
 The U.S. hoped the Western Hemisphere could be protected against aggression from Cuba . The original USUSSR agreement of October 1962 for ground inspection was unable to persuade Castro to accept .
 The U.S. has no desire to inflame the situation further, the ambassador says . The ambassador says the United States is not interested in inflameing the situation .
 The United States overflights are as discreet as possible, but it is essential for the U.S. to maintain them . "There is no danger from Cuba," says President Obama .
 The overflights are also related to Castros activities in the Hemisphere . Castros overflights were related to his efforts in the hemisphere .
 Gromyko had said that these activities were more talk than action . But the U.S. has indications of actual Cuban subversive action in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and most recently in Guatemala .
 The Secretary emphasized that he was mentioning these matters out of a desire to avoid a major crisis with Cuba . The Secretary of State said he was talking about these matters .
 He hoped that the Soviet Government will caution Castro not to inflame the situation into a major crisis .
 The United States is not attempting to stir up a crisis over Cuba, Obama says . Obama hopes Castro is in the same mood and hopes he doesn't stir up any crisis .
 He also hoped that some progress could be made toward a nuclear free zone in Latin America . He said he also hoped for some progress .
 He had the impression that the USSR would favor such a zone but that Castro opposed it . He said he was surprised by Castro's opposition to the zone .
 Cuba could not be a serious threat to the U.S. or the Western Hemisphere, says President Obama . Cuba could be serious threat for the United States, says Obama .
 The Secretary replied that Castro knew he could live at peace with the other nations of the Hemisphere if he so desired, but on the contrary he had declared war against his neighbors . Castro said he could have lived with peace with other nations if he wished, the Secretary replied .
 Cuba mounted a real threat in Venezuela, Guatemala and Guatemala, and was also involved in Panama . Cuba had mounted a . real threat to Venezuela and Guatemala .
 The basic point was that Castro was not trying to find a way to live at peace with his neighbors . But, the Secretary repeated, the United States is not looking for trouble over this issue . The U.S. will not look for trouble, he said .
 The USSR agreed to ground inspection of the missile sites in Cuba in October 1962 . In response to a question from Dobrynin the Secretary reminded him that the USSR had agreed .
 The United States is interested in a nuclear free zone in Latin America, he says . Such a zone would go far to meet the inspection problem, he adds .
 The United States and other Western Hemisphere nations are still interested in the possibility of a nuclear free zone which would include all except the United States . The Secretary of State confirmed that the U.S. would still be interested .
 Dobrynin raised the question as to why Cuba had suddenly received so much attention during the last few days . Dobrynins: Cuba has suddenly become the world's most famous destination .
 Dobrynin implied that the United States had itself generated the recent attention to Cuba . There followed an exchange on this subject .
 The Secretary concluded the conversation by reiterating that Castro had an opportunity to live at peace with his neighbors but was not interested . The United States wants no further crisis over ""this wretched little man"" and he trusted the USSR felt the same way .
 Discussion with President Johnson in his office . The President and Mr McCone will discuss the President and McCone .
 I mentioned to President Johnson that I had discussed with Eisenhower the possibility of a Cuban shooting down a U.2. President Johnson said he had discussed the possibility .
 Eisenhower did not go so far as to firmly recommend this action . However, after considering the problem and reviewing a map, he expressed the opinion that perhaps it would be best .
 I stated I most certainly would take out several SAM sites in the vicinity and possibly all of them. I stated that I would take them out of the vicinity . I said I would kill SAM sites .
 President Johnson favored taking them all out, indicating that the public opinion, UN discussion, etc. would be just as valid on one as on all and therefore we might as well dispose of the problem in its totality . President Johnson retorted he agreed he agreed .
 I told President Johnson it was unnecessary to have a U2 shot down, that we could operate the ECM equipment, but this had been steadfastly opposed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff . I then told President . Johnson it . was unnecessary, he said .
 President asked that I discuss this matter with McNamara and General Taylor . President asked me to discuss the matter . McNamara, General Taylor and Secretary of State McNamara discussed the issue .
 McNamara was of the opinion that JCS was incorrect for technical reasons . McNamara said use of the ECM on the U2 would not compromise the plan to use it on the B52. Subsequently I reviewed this question with McNamara .
 McNamara stated that the subject was very technical and therefore it was agreed to convene a technical group from Defense and CIA who could examine all facets of the problem . A meeting scheduled for 12:00 noon on Saturday, May 2nd.
 The U.S. and UK have taken steps to place economic pressure on Cuba . U.K. and U.N. have taken measures to place pressure on the Cuban government . Cuba has not responded to the request of the United States and Britain .
 I am inclosing a detailed list to give you a more precise and complete picture of United States actions. I am . I am not only giving you a detailed . list of actions .
 Topol 1696 to Paris, May 4, reported that at this meeting the ""question of British trade with Cuba, including credit guarantees, was raised by President and Secretary in vigorous terms"" in private meetings with Butler .

 Special National Intelligence Estimate/1/ SNIE 85264 Washington, D.C. May 2, 1964 .
 The estimate was prepared in the Central Intelligence Agency with the participation of the intelligence organizations of the Departments of State and Defense and the National Security Agency . According to a note on the cover sheet this estimate was .
 The United States Intelligence Board concurred in this estimate on May 2 . The U.S. intelligence board concurred with this estimate .
 The Problem To estimate Cuban and Soviet intentions with regard to United States overflights of Cuba . LIKELIHOOD OF AN ATTEMPTED SHOOT- DOWN OF A U.S. The Problem
 When we last reviewed this general subject in December 1963, we estimated /2/ that the Soviets would probably relinquish control of the SAM system in Cuba . Perhaps shortly after the Cubans were able to operate the entire system, we said .
 Castro might try to force a political solution with regard to the overflights . Castro might begin such a campaign even before final transfer of the system, experts say .
 Castro still prefers to try to force the cessation of U2 flights by political pressure at the UN and elsewhere . Castro is now engaged in a campaign of this sort, says CNN.com .
 U2 flights over Cuban territory will be forced to stop, says Cuban leader . He says he expects to gain complete control of the SAM system within the next few weeks .
 The Soviets must for obvious reasons give strong political support to Castro . Yet they almost certainly wish to avoid the major crisis which would follow a shoot-down .
 U.S. can't have no assurance that Khrushchev will take this way out of the country . The US, however, can have no assurances that he won't .
 "The odds favor the complete turnover of controls to Cuban personnel," says CNN.com . "We continue to estimate that the odds favor that the ... Cuban personnel will be able to control the situation in Cuba"
 The Soviets probably still hope to persuade the U.S. to discontinue or modify the overflight program . The Soviets still want to keep the program alive .
 Recent Soviet approaches to the U.S. may have been designed to gain time and probe for a possible settlement . The Soviet Union may have approached the United States in an effort to get time and gain time .
 The Soviets will urge Castro to try all possible political actions before shooting . Probably also the Soviets will strongly urge Castro not to shoot .
 If Castro obtains control of the SAM system and becomes convinced that agitation and pressures are ineffective, there will be a significant and growing chance that he will order a shoot-down . If Castro becomes convinced, there may be a growing chance of a shoot down .
 He may believe that any U.S. military reaction will be a limited one, and could even help his case by incensing world opinion .
 There is, of course, a possibility of an unauthorized shoot-down attempt; in view of the importance to Castro of this matter we believe the chances of such an occurrence are small .
 The President joined the meeting in progress in the Cabinet Room at 10:40m. According to the Presidents Daily Diary, the meeting was taking place at 10.40m . The meeting took place in a Cabinet Room, the White House said .
 USIB/2/ reaffirmed the need for overflights but on a reduced scale . Two to three flights per week would meet COMOR requirements, except for a most unusual circumstance .
 The new CIA-developed high-altitude, high-speed Oxcart reconnaissance aircraft, later known as the SR71 Blackbird, would ""not be operational at the design speed of 3.5 mph" The aircraft would be operational only at a speed of about 3.
 Thompson stated that his analysis of recent statements by Khrushchev and Castro indicated that there was a strain between the Soviets and Castro . Thompson said that recent statements indicate that there is a strain in the relationship between the two countries .
 Castro is concerned that the relaxed tensions between the United States and the USSR exposed Cuba to actions by the U.S. which would not be seriously challenged by Khrushchev . It appeared to him that Castro was concerned that relaxed tensions .
 SNIE /3/ read carefully and all agreed with the conclusions . McCone contributed the SNIE/3/ .
 There was some discussion in which there was complete agreement on the obvious necessity for continued overflights . There was also some discussion on the need to continue overflights to the area .
 Rusk stated that we cannot negotiate with Castrothis was out of the question . Rusk said he would not negotiate with the Castro .
 Castro will attempt to bring the issue to the Security Council or the General Assembly . Castro will also try to bring it to the UN Security Council .
 He will receive considerable sympathy but he will not receive an affirmative vote in the Security Council, he says . He could not get the two-thirds majority necessary to place the subject before the General Assembly .
 Our tactic will be to throw the issue into the OAS, thus keeping it out of the UN and depending upon the October, 1962 resolution which calls for continuing aerial surveillance in the absence of on-site inspection .
 Rusk did not expect a blessing from the UN or the world at large, but he does not expect an adverse vote in any form . Rusk says he doesn't expect any adverse vote from the world, but expects an adverse outcome .
 The question arose as to reopening the UN offer for on-site inspection . The UN has offered to inspect the site of the site .
 McCone stated that much would depend on how this inspection was carried out . McCone said that much of the inspection would depend upon the inspection .
 UN inspection has not been very satisfactory and that probably aerial photography would be necessary to complement on-site inspection . Aerial photography would probably be necessary for aerial photography, says UN .
 Rusk said that their attorneys felt that if the issue was brought to the World Court, our case would not be good, however they could confuse it by concurrently putting forth a great many counter claims against Cuba such as ceding property, etc., etc. etc. Rusk .
 I then turned to a discussion of the alternatives as covered in pages 4 through 7 . I then went to the next page to discuss the alternatives to the alternatives .
 I added a point made at USIB that a shootdown of a drone would not create an incident exactly paralleling the shoot down of a U2 . I also put forward the idea of drones .
 State Department's reservations, but not their dissent at USIB, on the intensity of the overflight program . Also in the discussion, I noted State Department’s reservations . Also noted that the State Departments reservations were with the USIB .
 The U2 flights should be continued, the use of ECMs should be carefully considered . The compromise of the equipment was up to the JCS and Secretary of Defense .
 We could expect a continuing flow of human resource information concerning ""missiles in Cuba"", which must be checked out . Alternate means of aerial photography were not satisfactory; alternate intelligence assets would not suffice our needs .
 Rusk reviewed the discussions accurately, except in interpreting the SNIE he indicated to the President the Board was not concerned about the immediacy of an incident . Rusk said to the president the board was not worried about an incident that occurred immediately .
 We should continue the U2s overflights on the basis of two to three a week as determined by USIB; b. We should also continue overflights for the next two weeks . b. A. U.S. should continue to do so on the
 He favored use of the ECM; he instructed McNamara and the Chiefs to review the subject on Monday . /4/ he felt the JCS arguments were probably not valid and he wished them studied in the light of the morning discussion .
 He called a meeting for 12:00 oclock noon Tuesday to make a final decision on the use of ECM equipment .
 During the meeting there was considerable discussion of the use of the Oxcart . The Oxcart was used during the meeting .
 I stated that it was my opinion that it could be used in a matter of weeks at about 2.30 a.m. I said it was possible to use it in a few weeks at 2.50 a day .
 Mach and 85,000 feet, that its presence would be known because it would appear on the radar and the sonic boom would be audible . It would be more disturbing to people in Cuba than U2s because they would hear the Oxcart, that because of the absence of
 I pointed out the use of the Oxcart would compromise it as a reconnaissance vehicle . I also pointed out that it would be compromised by its use as a military reconnaissance vehicle.
 McNamara stated that if ECM equipment was used, he felt there would be a 95% or more possibility that the first U2 that was attacked would survive and come home . McNamara said he felt that if used, the chances would be 95% that the U�
 He pointed and, and and I confirmed, that this would create a new situation as it would demonstrate Castros true intentions which were now only a matter of conjecture . He said: “I confirmed, and . I confirmed that this . would . demonstrate Castro’s
 McNamara asked that the Contingency Plan be amended to discuss courses of action under such a situation . McNamara: "We are prepared to deal with the situation"
 McNamara says he does not agree with the Joint Chiefs on the seriousness of the compromise of ECM equipment . He suggests it be kept in readiness, and the question be reviewed from week to week . McNamara then says he is against using it now .
 Both of the above to be discussed with JCS Monday afternoon in preparation for Tuesdays meeting . c. c. JCS will meet with the governor on Tuesday afternoon .
 d. Develop in detail the Agency position on ECM which varies from the SAGJCS position . d. develop in detail how the agency views ECM .
 CIA planes equipped with ECM on short notice until the SAC planes are fully modified . Prepare to supply CIA planes on short . notice . CIA planes will have ECM capability .
 McNamara stated that ECM equipment similar to Systems 1315 was aboard the Powers plane and therefore known to the Soviets . In this discussion McNamara said the equipment was aboard that plane . McNamara also stated that the Soviets knew about the system .
 "I would like this explored because this question did not arise in the Powers Hearings," says D.C. Rep. Ruben Navarrette .
 "I raised the question as to why this matter, if true, was not brought out in the very extensive Hearings with Powers upon his return. Also I raised the . question as well as the . fact that this matter was not . brought out . upon his . return, if
 After his release from captivity by the Soviets, he spoke about the incident at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 6, 1962 .
 Aerial photography is the only dependable evidence we have on the status of Soviet military equipment in Cuba . Aerial photographs are the only reliable source of reliable information .
 All alternatives to aerial photography have been studied and all have been found wanting . All alternatives have been carefully studied, including aerial photography .
 The intelligence community has concluded that overflights must be continued . But the number of missions can be reduced from the number now flown . The number of overflights should be reduced, the intelligence community says .
 There have been forty-two refugee reports about missiles in Cuba since January 1, 1964 . Forty-two reports have been made about missiles since then .
 Castro will probably take over control of the SAM sites . He probably will try to shoot down a U2 at some time in the near future .
 Secretary Rusk asked whether we had aerial photography which we had not read out . Secretary Rusks asked whether there were aerial photographs which had not been read out in the papers .
 We have taken pictures of the same objects many times but we continue to have a requirement for current pictures in order to check on incoming refugee reports . However, we have taken the same pictures many times .
 The number of flights could be reduced but this made little difference because the risk of a shoot-down remained approximately the same . The political cost of the overflight problem was not materially affected by the number of missions flown, says the author .
 Secretary Rusk and Mr McCone expressed the agreement of all those present that there is a requirement for from two to three flights per weektwo certainly and an additional one if cloud cover or other problems make the third flight necessary .
 Ambassador Thompson said overflights of Cuba create strain on Soviet-Cuban relations . Ambassador Thompson commented that overflights create a strain on relations .
 The Soviets, in their May Day slogans, had downgraded the Cuban problem . The Soviets' May Day slogan was "downgrading" the problem of Cuban refugees .
 The Soviets believed, however, that because we had sent a note on overflights to the Cubans via the Czechs, we were taking a new initiative and launching a new move against Castro . The Soviets thought that because of the overflights, they were taking an initiative against Castro,
 They felt we had interpreted the climate of improving U.S.-Soviet relations to mean that we had a free hand to do what we wished to Castro as far as the USSR was concerned . They felt they had concluded that . we had concluded . that we . interpreted the . climate of
 Secretary Rusk said Dobrynin had asked him why we had raised the problem of overflights in a note in writing . The secretary of state and director of state-run affairs said the problem had been raised in writing in a letter .
 He had left the impression that we could have handled this in another way, thereby avoiding making a direct issue of a problem which had not been causing concern for months . He said: ‘He had left impression that . We could have . handled this way,’ he said .
 Khrushchev's ideas were rejected by Castro's rejection of them . These ideas had been accepted but rejected by the Castro regime . Khrushvic's ideas had to be accepted by Khrushchevitch but rejected .
 Ambassador Thompson pointed out that Castro, in his recent speech, had made clear that the overflights issue was not of a nature to lead to the possibility of nuclear war . Ambassador Thompson said Castro made clear in his speech that overflights are not of an nature to cause nuclear war.
 Ambassador believes the danger of a Cuban shoot-down of a U2 will increase . However, the Ambassador believes that the danger will increase.
 Secretary Rusk then asked how we could best meet the agreed intelligence requirement . The Secretary of State Rusk asked how best to meet the intelligence requirements .
 If we equipped it with electronic countermeasures, its vulnerability would be greatly decreased . Countermeasures would be developed very rapidly, thereby reducing the effectiveness of existing ECM equipment . The U.S. government says it has no plans to use the system .
 The use of ECM risks compromising equipment in the event that an ECM-equipped U2 were shot down . In addition, the use of the ECM is also a risk of compromising the equipment .
 The Russians know about our system but they are not familiar with specific equipment which we have developed . The Russians do not know about specific equipment that they have developed. The Russians are not aware of specific equipment .
 If the Russians knew our ECM was on a U2, they might try very hard to shoot one down . Secretary Rusk pointed out that if the Russians . knew our . ECM . was on the U.S. ECM, Rusk said .
 He said the plane did have some ECM equipment which undoubtedly had been obtained by the Russians . He said it did have ECM technology which was probably obtained by Russia .
 All the Government’s ECM experts are agreed that the Soviets have our ECM equipment or equipment similar to it . Secretary McNamara added that all the Governments ECm experts are . agreed that . all the . Governments . ECM . experts are
 General LeMay noted that he believed the Soviets may have the idea of our system but they do not have specific knowledge of our equipment . LeMay said he believes the Soviets might have the . idea of the system but not specific knowledge . of our systems .
 Secretary McNamara pointed out that ECM is not on our major strike forces . "ECM" is not a major strike force .
 If the plane were shot at, we would then have a new confrontation requiring additional U.S. action, he says . The plane would then be shot at .
 This particular situation is not included in the present contingency plan, which is based on a U2 having been shot down . The contingency plan is not based on the possibility of a shooting down of the plane .
 General LeMay said that the Cubans had the option of not shooting at the first mission of an ECM-equipped U2 . LeMay: The Cubans have the option to not shoot at first mission .
 In a short time they would learn how to deal with the ECM equipment and then would be in a position to attack the U2. In a few weeks they would be able to attack a U.2.
 Secretary McNamara said that even after practice the Cubans would have only an approximate 20% chance of shooting down an ECM-equipped U2 . McNamara: Even after practice, Cubans had only a 20% shot chance of firing down U.S. missiles .
 Deputy Secretary Vance commented that the chances of hitting a U2 were much greater if it did not have ECM equipment . Vance said the chances were greater if the aircraft were equipped with ECM .
 This is useful for targets on the coast but it does not cover inland targets and will not provide the intelligence we require . It does not provide intelligence on inland targets, but it will provide intelligence .
 The shooting down of a drone would call for a different response by the U.S. because no pilot is involved . No pilot is in the role of shooting down a drone .
 These could operate at 90100 thousand feet with good cameras and would be relatively invulnerable . They would be able to operate at 100,000ft with good camera technology .
 They cannot be controlled without an elaborate setup which does not exist but which could be constructed . However, they can be controlled with an elaborate set-up .
 The coverage is not as good as the U2 and the American public, learning of this, could complain that we were not adequately covering the island . Thus, the coverage of the island could be less than that of the U’S.
 Secretary Rusk said that a balloon is different only because it is unmanned . The balloon is not the first time a balloon has been unmanned .
 General LeMay said pilot of a U.2 cannot outmaneuver a SAM missile . LeMay was responding to Secretary Rusk�s question .
 To do so keeps the plane in the area a longer time, and, therefore, increases the risk . To keep a plane in an area longer than it can be seen, the plane will be in the air longer than expected .
 This plane is not ready to fly at its peak capacity and will not be for several months . The plane will be ready to take off in several weeks .
 The plane makes a loud sonic boom which would be heard by many people on the ground . The sonic boom would not be relieved because of the plane's loudness .
 Secretary Rusk commented that we might use the Oxcart with its sonic boom and then ask Castro if he preferred that we go back to the silent U2 . Castro said he would prefer to use the silent Oxcart instead of the sonic boom .
 Mr McCone said the camera resolution is not good enough for our purposes . He said it is not the best resolution for the camera to capture .
 There is the difficulty of the north and south orbit of present satellites . There is also the difficulty in the current orbit of the satellites .
 There is a possibility of an east-west satellite orbit . It would take at least nine months to establish tracking stations to make such an orbit possible .
 The plane is capable of a supersonic burst and the first mission would get through, but following missions would have great difficulty . The plane would be able to get through with a first mission .
 The UN Security Council might be asked to vote against the overflights . The overflights have been seen as a security risk to the U.N. Security Council .
 If we could persuade the Council that the OAS was seized of the problem, we could avoid an adverse vote, but we could not possibly get a favorable vote . We are not sure if we could get the Council's favorable vote but we can't possibly get the vote .
 The General Assembly could be kept from a 2/3 adverse vote . General Assembly will not meet until Fall, but could keep the vote from being held .
 We would probably get more ""yes"" than ""no"" votes but many countries would abstain . Many countries would probably abstain from voting on the issue .
 October 1962 proposals for on-site inspection in Cuba were put forward in 1962 . We might revise the October 1962 proposal for inspections .
 "The risk here is that the Cubans might accept and then we would have to give up overflights in return," he says . The risk is that Cuba might accept but then the U.S. might have to accept overflights .
 Director McCone said he was not prepared to answer the question but he would look at it carefully . Director said he would be looking at the possibility .
 Secretary Rusk is not too sanguine about what we would do if Castro took us to the World Court in an effort to disprove our right to overfly Cuba .
 We say it is, but the International Court of Justice might not say it's true . We say that it's not, but we think it's, and we're sure it is . The case is likely to be heard in court in the coming weeks .
 World Court would offer to adjudicate all outstanding legal issues with Cuba, says PM . Castro wants to use the World Court to deal with Cuba's use of the world court, he says .
 We could confuse the overflight issue by talking about the legality of the nationalization of American property in Cuba, etc. etc. We could also confuse the issue by discussing the legal status of the U.S. property .
 Cuba could formally withdraw from the OAS and denounce the treaty, thereby claiming that it was not bound by any OAS action . There is always the possibility that Cuba could officially withdraw from OAS . Cuba could also claim to be not bound to the treaty .
 One action would be to go again to the OAS to request a reaffirmation of the 1962 resolution . The OAS should be asked again to reaffirm its 1962 resolution, he says .
 Secretary Rusk concluded by saying that inevitably we must continue the U2 flights . The secretary of state said that inevitably, inevitably, the flights will continue .
 We should look again, perhaps at a later date, at the possibility of using Oxcart . Oxcart is a tool that has been used in the past by many of the world's most famous people .
 He said he personally felt we could use the ECM and would have a 95% survival chance of escaping on the first shot if the U2 immediately aborted . He said that he personally . felt we . could have a . 95% chance of escape on the . first shot
 He did not recommend the use of ECM now because he did not think the Cubans were ready to attempt a shoot-down . He said he didn't think the Cuban government was ready to try to use it now .
 He recommended that the use of ECM be reconsidered on the basis of a review each week of the risk of a Cuban effort to shoot down a U2 .
 The ECM equipment could be put on the U2 a very few hours after a decision is made, General LeMay said .
 Mr McCone described the sonic boom problem with the A11 which the U2 does not have . The U’S.2 has no sonic boom problems, he said .
 When the A11 is flying at maximum altitude and maximum speed, it is dubious whether the SAM missile could hit it . The missile could be hit by the missile if it were hit by it .
 The U.S. should take every precaution to avoid a U2 being shot down . However, we should take a precaution, says U.N. official .
 He asked that the Joint Chiefs of Staff review their position and to weigh the use of the ECM against the possibility of a U2 shoot-down .
 A careful study of the use of the A11 as an alternative would be available then . A careful review of the project could be published in 2015 .
 We must make every effort to increase the security of the overflight planes . We must provide the required intelligence, but we must provide intelligence, says the minister .
 We should get our information in a most secure way and make the overflights as secure as possible . We should make overflights more secure and secure, he says. We should also make our information secure in a secure way .
 Secretary Rusk said we might consider a mix of overflight instruments such as U2s, interspersed with the A11s .
 Secretary McNamara said the plan did not discuss what we would do if an ECM-equipped U2 were shot at but not shot down . McNamara: Plan did not outline what would be done if a U2 was shot at .
 Mr Bundy said the contingency plan was available for the President�¼s reading . The contingency plan is available for Presidents reading.
 He had gotten almost to a point where he hated to meet with Foreign Ministers because he read in the press the following day everything he had said to the Minister and some things he hadnt said .
 Only four people were present at a recent meeting, but reports of what went on appeared in the press . Only four members of the public attended the meeting .
 President Johnson joined the meeting in progress in the Cabinet Room at 12:25m. and left at 12.55m. According to the Presidents Daily Diary President Johnson left at around 12:55m .
 Discussion at NSC Meeting5 May 1964 in Washington, DC . In attendance: Rusk, Ball, Johnson, Thompson, . Thompson, McNamara, Vance, . Vance, Taylor, Bundy and Bundy .
 McNamara reviewed the use of ECM equipment on the U2s, stating that doing so would not compromise SIOP . /2/ would give some protection initially but not over the long range; the Soviets know the principals of our ECM; ECM would not provide
 JCS objects are objects for a variety of reasons and General Taylor discussed this with General Taylor . General Taylor also discussed this in an interview with CNN iReport .
 General Taylor stated that the JCS agree that the use would not compromise SIOP; pointed out 14 countries have SAMs and therefore compromise might be serious at some future time . General Taylor said the use of SAMs would not be compromised .
 Vulnerability was uncertain and was dependent upon the warhead, noting there were 100# and 500# warheads . DIA had indicated 500# weapons were on the Cuban SAMs .
 Rusk raised the question of whether a new pattern of flights crossing the island, rather than flying the axis of the island would reduce exposure . Rusk also raised the possibility of flying the island's axis instead of the axis .
 McNamara said this could be done by increasing the number of flights and therefore the danger . McNamara also said it could also be done to increase the danger of the plane crash .
 McNamara advanced the idea of drones, stating they were awkward to use, of questionable reliability, limited in quantity . McNamara then raised the alternative intelligence means, raising the issue of drones as an alternative intelligence method .
 McNamara agreed and after some discussion the drone question was pretty well dismissed . McNamara: "The drone question is pretty well well dismissed"
 The same is true of balloons as it was felt they represented more serious operational problems than drones . It was felt that balloons were more serious issues than drones.
 The Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, expressed himself very positively against changing to drones as it would represent an unacceptable retreat .
 I stated that it was coming along well, giving the figures on the number of flights and the speeds but that all of our operational people, without exception, felt that we must not attempt to use it until it is completely debugged . This would take several months .
 Mach the Oxcart would possibly be vulnerable to SAMs though this was uncertain . Mach the . Oxcart was possibly vulnerable to . SAMs but this is uncertain .
 I stated that when fully operational it probably would be quite invulnerable except under miraculous circumstances . I said that when . fully operational, when fully . operational it . probably would probably would . probably be quite . invulnerable . except under . miraculous circumstances, he said .
 Thompson spoke the political situation, feeling that Khrushchev and Castro would be restrained during this year, recognizing our internal political situation . Thompson spoke of the situation in an interview with CNN's Tom Charity .
 Rusk and McNamara reviewed the conversations . The President entered and Rusk entered the room to meet with McNamara .
 "A properly planned and executed on-site inspection would be somewhat more dependable than in October 1962 because of our knowledge of the island gained through extensive photography," says author . "I agreed that properly planned ... inspection would ... be somewhat less dependable"
 McNamara recommended that we operate for a week with U2s at the rate of 2 to 3 flights a week on the assumption that Castro will not take offensive action . McNamara then recommended that the U.S. operate for the week .
 In the meantime we create ECM capability but not use it; finally we expedite our drone capability to give us an option but that we emphatically deny any intent to use them . Finally, we are expediting drone capability, giving us a drone option, but not an option .
 McNamara noted some leaks about drones out of the Pentagon which disturbed him . McNamara said he was disturbed by some of the leaks from the Pentagon .
 I took the position we would do all we could to push the development and debug the vehicle but said that we were working against unexplored frontiers of aviation . Many felt unexpected problems were arising some of which we can answer rapidly, but many have to be answered by methods of
 Secretary Rusk asked Secretary McNamara to review the problem of the use of electronic countermeasures on U2s overflying Cuba . McNamara will look at the problem .
 Some experts believe the survivability of U.S. bombers over the USSR will be reduced if ECM is used over Cuba . Some experts say it could reduce survivability over Cuba if it was used .
 Use of ECM on U2s over Cuba will not provide great protection for planes flying regularly over Cuba . ECM will not protect planes flying over Cuba, says Air Force spokesman .
 After the first flight there would be a 90% chance of a successful shootdown if the Cubans made a determined attack on the plane . The Cuban government would have to shoot down the plane after it was shot down .
 There may come a time when we have a critical need to look at a SAM-defended site . In addition, there may also be a need for a SAM defense .
 "If we use the ECM now, we would throw away the one free ride which we would like to have in reserve in case of critical need," says Ravi Agrawalala .
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommends against the use of ECM because it will not protect continued overflights . ECM equipment will also risk compromising the equipment, the chiefs of staff say .
 Secretary McNamara said that flight plans could be made which expose a U2 to attack from fewer SAM sites .
 Secretary McNamara said the use of drones would be an awkward way of meeting our intelligence requirements . McNamara: Use of drones will be awkward way to meet intelligence needs .
 There are numerous operational problems limiting the capability of drones, including drones . There are many operational problems that are limiting drone capabilities .
 We have enough drones now so that within ninety days we could carry out our full reconnaissance requirements, but for the next ninety days, we could obtain only 75% of our requirements . The U.S. government says it has enough drones to carry out its full reconnaissance needs within 90 days
 With existing drones encountering enemy action we could probably carry on for several weeks . We could operate at the 59,000 to 54,000 foot level level .
 Director McCone said he had trouble with the suggestion that we rely on drones to meet our aerial reconnaissance requirements . He said he didn't want drones to be used to meet aerial reconnaissance needs .
 This difference in altitude is important because the drones flying at the lower level will have contrails . This is because they will have a lower altitude than the ones flying at lower level . This difference is important to avoid contrails in the air .
 There is considerable difference in the width of the ground photographed18 vs. nautical miles .
 There is a loss of track accuracy of plus or minus five miles, or approximately an eighteen-mile swath . There is also a loss .
 Secretary McNamara said he agreed with Mr McCones evaluation of the difference between the U2s and drones, but, even so, we could carry out our required intelligence mission by using drones .
 The cost would be about $80,000 per drone mission or about $150,000 a U2 equivalent . The cost of the drone missions would range from $20,000 to about $200,000 .
 If there is enemy action against the drones, they would be able to carry out their mission for a period ranging from two to six weeks . The drones could carry out missions for as long as six weeks depending on the length of the mission .
 Bundy asked whether McNamara was thinking of a course which would run Castro out of weapons . Mr Bundy asked if McNamara had been thinking of such a course .
 We might use nonphotographic drones which would be less costly to lose . For example, we might use drones which are less expensive to lose.
 Mr McCone said the idea of running Castro out of SAM missiles would depend on whether he used MIG21s against drones .
 Secretary McNamara replied that great pilot skill is required if a MIG actually shoots down a drone . McNamara: "Great pilot skill" is required to shoot down the drone .
 Secretary McNamara said that the possibility of our using drones was leaking to the press . Secretary McNama said that . possibility of using drones is leaking to . the press, he said .
 This disturbed him greatly and he had instructed his press officers to deny flatly that any consideration is being given to the substitution of drones for U2s .
 Under Secretary Ball made the point that if it became known to the Cubans that we were flying drones, Castro would undoubtedly attack them . Ball said the Cuban leader would attack the U.S. in Cuba .
 Mr Bundy said that he agreed that the Cubans would act more promptly against a drone than against piloted planes . Bundy said he agreed with Mr Bundy that Cubans will act more quickly against drones .
 Secretary McNamara commented that we would have to respond to the shooting down of drones at some point, particularly if it later became possible for us to fly thirty drones per month .
 General Taylor said that the Cubans would not really know whether we were flying drones or piloted U2s . General Taylor: "It's not clear whether we're flying drones ... it's a good thing to say"
 Secretary McNamara pointed out, however, that if the Cubans knocked out drone after drone, we would have to make some response . McNamara: "If [Cubans] knocked out [droneets] out, it would be a response"
 With respect to balloons, McNamara said these had many of the disadvantages of drones, but operational difficulties with them were much higher . Secretary McNamara: Operational difficulties with balloons are much higher.
 Secretary Rusk asked whether, if we made the maximum use of peripheral photography, our overflights requirement would be reduced .
 Mr McCone replied that on-site inspection can now be made much more dependable than was the case in October 1962 .
 The information we have received from these photographs will not decay seriously over time . The information is not likely to decay over time and will not be taken seriously .
 1962 inspection plan called for overflights by UN planes in addition to on-site inspection . Alexis Johnson recalled that the 1962 plan had called for overflow flights by the UN .
 We could renew this proposal and insist on the UN-operated reconnaissance system . We could renewed this proposal, we could renew it and insist it is a UN-run system .
 He said it was important to make clear the difference between the intelligence we wanted about specific targets for use in the event of an invasion and the information we need to reassure that strategic missiles were not being introduced into Cuba .
 Secretary Rusk asked if we could use a combination of means of . aerial reconnaissance . The Secretary of State Rusk said it was possible to use aerial reconnaissance to help .
 If the Cubans heard that we were replacing U2s with drones they would certainly try to shoot down the drones . He agreed that if the Cuban government heard that they would shoot them down they would try to do so .
 Secretary McNamara repeated his view that if word gets around that we are using drones, the Cubans would say that we're weakening our position . McNamara said if word comes out that we use drones, it would weaken our position in Cuba .
 The Attorney General agreed that if the word got around that we were no longer flying U2s, but using drones, the effect on public opinion would indeed be serious .
 Secretary Rusk asked what was the status of the proposal to use the A11 plane . Rusk also asked if the proposal is still going ahead .
 It has been operated successfully but not yet at the maximum speed it is apparently able to reach . It has not yet reached the speed it has been operating successfully .
 It is coming along very well, indeed, but it would be most dangerous to use the A11 now . It would be a disaster if it were to use it now, he says .
 The A11 is vulnerable to flameout and to other operational difficulties . It is also vulnerable to fire problems . It has been described as a 'vulnerable' device .
 Several more months are needed for testing to ensure that the plane is fully operational . Several additional months of testing are needed to ensure it is fully functional .
 Early versions of the A11 had to come down to 35,000 feet in order to relight their engines after a flameout . For example, he said the early versions of this aircraft had to go down to 40,000ft .
 Each plane had to be modified to include the new equipment making possible the relighting of the engines without the descent . A way around this limitation had been found, but each plane must be modified .
 He said we are on the very far frontier of knowledge and there are many problems remaining . He said there are still many problems to be solved .
 Those who had operated the planes were unanimous in agreeing that it would be reckless to use them over Cuba without further testing .
 Secretary McNamara said everyone was unanimous in opposing the use of the A11 for at least several months . McNamara: Everyone was unanimous .
 Secretary Rusk said that if the Cubans learned an A11 was flying over they would make every effort to shoot it down .
 The A11 will be much less vulnerable when it is fully ready, Mr McCone said .
 There were many imponderables in trying to decide whether the plane could be shot down . There were 'imponderable' imponderable things to decide if the plane was shot down, the pilot says .
 He concluded that it was theoretically possible to shoot down an A11 if everything used against it worked perfectly, i.e., a perfectly trained crew and a perfect SAM site operation were used .
 He reminded the group that although the A11 cannot be seen, its sonic boom can be heard clearly . He reminded them of the sonic boom that can be clearly heard in the sound waves .
 Castro: Use of the A11 would be more objectionable than the U2 . Castro: "From Castros point of view, the use of the . A¥11 is more objectionable . than the . U¥2 is also objectionable, Castro
 Ambassador Thompson commented that it was doubtful that Castro would contemplate early action against an overflying plane . Ambassador Thompson said Castro would not have contemplated early action .
 The Soviets were very conscious of the timing in relation to the elections in the U.S. The Russians would object to the Cubans taking the case to the UN, he said .
 Mr Alexis Johnson pointed out that while Castro might not push his case in the UN, the Secretary General undoubtedly would ask for our informal views on Castro’s letter to the Secretary .
 Secretary Rusk replied that if this happened we could remind the Secretary General of our 1962 offer . We were prepared to negotiate on the basis of Castro accepting on-site inspection and UN aerial reconnaissance .
 Alexis Johnson replied that we had some time to work this out . Mr Alexis Johnson said we had time in which to work out .
 The President joined the group and Secretaries Rusk and McNamara summarized the earlier discussion . President Obama joined the President to discuss the President's role .
 He said ECM did not ensure survival of the U2, but that the first plane flown with ECM had a very high chance of escaping .
 Secretary McNamara estimated that even with enemy action, we would be able to carry on a continuous program of drone flights for one to twelve weeks . If Castro fired on the drones, it would obviously have a major political problem, McNamara said .
 With respect to the A11, Mr McCone summarized his view that the plane was not now ready for use .
 We could engage in a political holding action with the UN Secretary General. We could also engage in an 'political holding action' with the Secretary General .
 There are ways to keep the ball in play, but we expect nothing to come of these moves . We expect nothing of nothing from these moves, despite the fact that they are not going to be used .
 The President asked how serious Castro was when he made statements about preventing overflights . The President said Castro was serious about stopping overflights from Cuba . Castro has been criticized for his comments .
 There are things we can do to reduce the risk of a shoot-down but we cannot back away in the face of Castros threats . However, there are things that can be done to reduce risk of shoot-downs .
 Mr Bundy replied that the contingency called for taking out one or more SAM sites . Mr Bundy: "It's a contingency"
 Secretary McNamara recommended that we proceed on the assumption that for the next week there will be no attack on our U2s . The U.S. Air Force says it will not be attacked again for a week .
 The Defense Department will look again at the proposals to use the ECM-equipped U2 and to use drones . The Defense Dept. will also look at the proposal to use a drone and a U.S. ECM equipped drone .
 The production of drones will be immediately increased, but a flat denial will be made to any press queries about whether consideration is being given to the use of drones .
 The readiness of the Oxcart could be speeded up, says the minister . The Oxcart is already being used to carry out a number of tasks in Afghanistan .
 Secretary Dillon asked what could be done in an all out effort to increase the readiness of the Oxcart . Secretary Dillon said there was a need for an increase in readiness .
 Mr McCone said operators were working as fast as they could on dealing with each problem as it arises .
 He said he would keep the pressure on but he did not think that a crash program should be undertaken . He did not want to put a crash plan into place .
 Secretary Rusk asked whether we should read anything into the timing of the public release by Castro of the discovery of the arms cache off the Cuban coast .
 Assistant Secretary Mann said we knew of their discovery of this cache on April 20th and they had waited several days before making their discovery public . Mann said the discovery was made public on April 21th .
 Continued exile raids /2/ are going to make it tougher to keep the lid on Cuba between now and November . The Cuban exile raids will make it harder to keep a lid on the island .
 Castro: This is just the sort of thing that evokes a highly emotional response from Castro . Castro: "It's just the kind of thing you evokes an emotional response" Castro: Castro's reaction to the incident was "a highly emotional"
 As things stand, he seems convinced that we are tied into the raidsas indeed we are . The raids are likely to continue .
 The CIA was advised that Artime planned another raid on two radar installations in Cuba for early June . The raid is believed to have taken place in Cuba .
 The cessation of assistance and pressure on countries like Nicaragua to cease providing facilities might do the trick .
 This step is a drastic one and could lead to angry charges that we are lending positive support to Castro . This step may lead to an angry reaction to Castro's election victory . This is not the first time Castro has been elected president .
 It is probably a step we would not want to take unless it became clear that these exile raids, which we can’t control, were propelling us to the brink . It is likely to be a step .
 "The exile grapevine is a sensitive one and the word will get around that we are really not involved," says the ex-presidential candidate .
 At a minimum, we might want to be impregnable to the charge that we are connected in any way with these exile activities . In sum, at a minimum of . a minimum . We might want . to be . impregnated to be indregnable .
 There may be a good deal of support in town in favor of doing something. Moreover, there may be good support for doing something .
 Alexis Johnson, Tom Mann, and John Crimmins are unhappy with the present trend of events . Alexis Johnson and Tom Mann are also unhappy about the state of affairs, according to State . State of the Union Secretary of State John Kerry has been forced to resign .
 You may want to initiate a discussion of this matter /4/ at the Special Group meeting today . You may also want to start a discussion about the issue at the meeting .
 We might want to consider making a distinction between raids and raids . Also, we might also want to make a distinction from raids .
 This June 3 paper was drafted by FitzGerald . It included a review of the history of the exile groups program . It also included the consequences of terminating U.S. support for them .
 The main conclusion was that the cessation of autonomous commando operations would effectively kill the remaining chances of carrying out the objectives of the Integrated Covert Action Program initiated in June 1963 .
 Mann thought if we cut off aid, the Cubans could blackmail us and it could get out, he said . Mann thought it would be a good idea to cut aid to Cuba, and it would get out of the country .
 Crimmins then said that before proceeding with this discussion he would like to fill Mann in on the apprehension of Manolo Ray by the British in the Bahamas . Crimmins said that he would also like to give Mann a brief account of the apprehension .
 Crimmins explained that Ray Ray was not using his own name, but that his identity was evidently now known . Crimmins said Ray's identity was now known, but his identity is now known. Crimmins: Ray not using own name .
 There were three Americans in the party, including a Life photographer and a girl radio operator, he said .
 Crimmins thought that being picked up ten days after he was supposed to be in Cuba would make him a laughingstock of Ray Crimmins . Crimmins: "I'm not going to go to Cuba. I'm going to make it a joke."
 Crimmins explained that we collaborate with the British in matters of this nature ""for many reasons"", particularly since August 1963 when Castro's forces kidnapped a group of Cuban exiles from Anguila Key .
 Crimmins said in the present case the British want to take the position they cooperated with us, but that the fact is we were cooperating with them in their waters at their request . Crimmins: "We were cooperating ... at the request"
 Another group of Cuban exiles was picked up on Anguila Key by the British a few months ago, fined $210 each, given suspended sentences of 90 days and deported to the United States . Crimmins said when we capture such groups we simply seize their equipment and set them free
 Mann thought we might quietly suggest to the British they do about what we do about the British . Mann: "We should ask the British what it is like to be in the UK"
 He thought we might tell them they were heading into a hornets nest, that they had a hero . He thought he might say they were going to be a hero. He thought .
 It was explained that the group was due in Nassau at 1:30 June 3 and that they would undoubtedly be tried, as were the others .
 It was decided that ""without really twisting their arm"" the British would be asked to low key the matter as much as possible .
 Mann suggested Crimmins talk with Alex Johnson about how to handle this aspect of the matter . Mann suggests Crimmins should talk to Crimmins about how he wants to handle it .
 U.S. officials traced weapons made for Ray to a basement in Miami which is now under surveillance . FitzGerald said a related development was that weapons from a West Coast carriage factory had been traced by United States .
 FitzGerald says he has 'assassination' weapons that can be used to kill enemies . The weapons include a special weapon that could be used in assassinations .
 Artime will put to sea Friday for two operations in Oriente province, one east and the other west of Santiago . FitzGerald also reported that Artime also will put out to sea for two more operations .
 FitzGerald seemed to think these operations would be more ""cream puff"" in nature than the Pilon raid . FitzGerrard seemed to be more "cream puff" than Pilon .
 Manns next appointment was announced and there was no time to return to a discussion of the autonomous operations paper . At this point Manns next appointees were announced .
 Mann said he would study the memorandum and probably arrange a special meeting to discuss it . Mann: "I will study it and probably meet with the governor to discuss the matter"

 Cuba’s got the convertible currencies to buy anything they want, says President Obama . Cuba has been buying all this sugar, and they’ve got these, Cubas got these . convertible currencies, he says .
 Castro made about two hundred million dollars a year that Castro made last year, and we expect him to make about the same this year as a result of the increased price of sugar . Castro is expected to make the same amount of money this year .
 Sugar prices are dropping, this is a very temporary phenomenon, he says . He says he's not going to have the money to buy this kind of stuff longer .
 "I dont think that the prognosis, the medium and long term prognosis is bad. So I don�think that the long-term prognosis isn’t bad," he said .
 About 25 percent of the people, the job holders, the office holders, are in favor of Castro, CNN's John Sutter says . "Young people in the country are better off than they ever were before," he says .
 We think there are about 25 to 30 percent of the people who are opposed to him . The middle ground there, the 40 to 50 percent, are just sort of apathetic, the authors say .
 President Obama's hard core of support is built around the people who hold jobs . And thats the way its been for the last year or so, and there isnt much change in that, he says .
 "Theyve sold him some things, and thats hurt us. Well, hes had these dollars and they�ve sold them some things," she said . "Thatt hurt us," she added .

 Mann: I think its going to have to come from . Someone kills Castro, or he dies, or the army is split in the very top command where they turn on him, the army especially . The people themselves can't get rid of him .
 "As long as that army is loyal to him, hes going to be there until he dies," he says . "He�s not going to die, but he�s going on to die," he adds .
 When he dies, nobody knows whats going to happen, because he’s got the same power to mesmerize people that Hitler had, and we doubt that anybody else has got, can project this same kind of image . Nobody knows when he dies because he
 The only other way to knock him off would be to go in there with force from the outside . This could happen either as a result of our reactions to his shooting at our planes that are doing this photographic stuff, or as a . result of collective action which were working
 The main objective is to say subversion is an aggression which is not an armed attack within the meaning of article six of the Rio Treaty, get them to accept that, so that if we have another act of subversion, well have a good legal basis of going to
 "We hope to clear that up considerably. Because the biggest problem, as you know, that we had in the Bay of Pigs, was this doubt on the part of the lawyers and others that we . had any right in international law to do anything," he says .
 "Subversion by importing arms to other countries to be considered aggression, that would justify our moving. So that for the subversion ... that would ... consider aggression," he said .
 President Obama says he doesn't intend to invade Cuba, just as Kennedy didn't . He says he should say at a press conference that he won't invade Cuba . Obama: "I dont intend to ... invade Cuba"
 Khrushchev said he hadn't seen us repeat Kennedy’s pledge and we ought to do it. Well they say he hadnt seen us repeating Kennedys pledge. Well, well they say Khrushchevitch is saying that he hadn’t
 I would send, I wouldn’t make a public statement, Id have the Secretary of State say that if he behaves himself, doesnt commit any aggressive acts against other Republics, that everythings going to be all right in terms of war
 You tell, in the morning you call Mac Bundy, hes not here, but you call him, and tell him I was talking to you last night, and youd like to know what hed propose to say in that statement . Then you tell
 Possible Statement by the President on Cuba . I understand from Tom Mann /2/ that the President is considering the desirability of volunteering a press statement reiterating our position with respect to a military invasion .
 Tom and I have thoroughly considered the matter, and for the reasons set forth below do not recommend that such a statement be made . Tom and Tom do not want to make a statement .
 President Kennedy stated in 1962 that if all offensive weapons systems were removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in the future, under adequate verification and safeguards, there will be peace in the Caribbean .
 President Barack Obama said in September: 'We shall neither initiate nor permit aggression in this hemisphere. And as I said, we shall . neither initiate or permit aggression, this hemisphere .
 Cuba is not a military threat to the U.S. or its neighbors, but it could pose an entirely different situation if it becomes a threat to other nations .
 Peace in the Caribbean depends on the actions of the Cuban Government . Peace depends on actions of Cuban Government, writes CNN's John Defterios .
 The statement is of necessity ambiguous as to whether the phrase ""aggressive acts"" includes acts of the kind that recently took place in Venezuela . The phrase is ambiguous whether it includes acts that might lead to armed conflict .
 To take the initiative in raising the issue of the ""no invasion pledge,"" at a time when it is not being pressed either by the Soviets /4/ or domestically, inevitably raises problems on one or both sides . However, the basic difficulty we see is that now to take the
 Khrushchev's statement raises domestic questions of the degree to which the Administration is prepared to ""co-exist"" with Castro . The President's statement appears to be less than the Kennedy statements .
 I understand that there will probably be no decision taken at this meeting . I understand further that there is probably no decision to take place at the meeting .
 He added the options of searching harder for an alternative to the U2 and encouraging the exile groups to make internally-mounted raids . He added that he had also suggested that he would search harder for a solution to the problem .
 Ray has been guilty of violations of the rules of ""autonomy" and of major errors in judgment, and of lack of success . Ray has admitted to violations of rules of 'autonomy' and 'major errors'
 Some, perhaps, can be mitigated by a plea of extenuating circumstances, but taken together they could easily justify our washing our hands of Ray and his group . Some of those circumstances can be explained by extramarital circumstances .
 There are, however, cogent reasons, for giving Ray Ray Ray another chance . Ray Ray has been in the news for more than a decade .
 The Cuban leader's strategic concept of political operations provides at least some hope for loosening up the situation within Cuba . The basic argument in favor of continuing support for him is the fact that his strategic concept provides some hope .
 Plans call for infiltration of small groups into Cuba with the object of beginning small-scale propaganda operations in urban and suburban areas, validated by occasional sabotage .
 The idea is to raise a symbol of organized, coherent and gradually expanding resistance to Castro . It aims to attract disaffected elements of the regime and of the mass by establishing the beginning of an alternative to the regime .
 Rays political platform, which is certainly left of center, and an echo of the original promises of the revolution, probably has greater potential for appealing to sectors of the power structure than any other group available to us .
 His proclamation of May 20 /3/ was, in my view, was, a very effective piece of political propaganda . His proclamation was, I view, an important piece of propaganda .
 It is impossible to assess the accuracy of Rays claims to support in being within Cuba . As it is with all exile groups, it is impossible .
 Castro's claims have more plausibility than those of others of others, he says . The most that can be said is that, given his role in the revolution, his post in the early days of the Castro regime, is that his claims are more likely than others .
 A prickly personality, Ray should not be viewed as having the leadership qualities of Fidel nor should his movement be expected to sweep the island . Ray is a prickly person who is not expected to be a leader .
 The most that we can prudently and realistically expect from a successful effort by Ray is a gradual loosening up of the internal structure . Probably the most that can be prudently expected from a . successful effort is that it will be gradual loosens up of internal structure, he says .
 Even if he gets inside and begins to work, it is entirely possible that he will lay a massive egg .
 His strategic political concept has merit, but it is his execution which has been miserable . Basically, however, he has merit but his execution has been terrible, he says .
 JURE people say that they have learned bitter lessons from the June 1 fiasco . They say they will not repeat them . The Agency reports that Jure people say they are not going to repeat the fiasco .
 It is entirely possible that they have been shocked into realizing the necessity for greater care and for abiding by the rules of engagement . It's entirely possible they have realized the necessity of greater care .
 U.S. territory cannot be used as a base of operations in the Dominican Republic, says President Obama . "Their pleas for our intercession with the Dominican Government stem from their knowledge that we have meant what we said," he says .
 A significant, if not major, part of their operational problems was caused by their inability to employ US-based equipment which was under strict surveillance . This has been borne in upon them with special force because they claim that they are not able to employ the equipment .
 With respect to Rays revelations to the newspaperman, there is now no way for him to correct that blunder . Rays revelation to a newspaperman is now a blunder, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 No amount of references to the general lack of discretion of the Cuban exile or to similar breaches of security by the other ""autonomous" leader can justify it, says CNN.com .
 Artime, because of his history, is much oftener credited with United States support than Ray Ray . Ray is credited with U.S. support more often than Ray .
 Szulc is more influential and may be more ready to use his information than most . Unfortunately, he is more likely to use it more often than anyone else .
 If we were to intercede with the Dominicans in Rays behalf, his establishment in the Dominican Republic would tend to confirm to Szulc Rays account to him and the hollowness of our insistence .
 He agrees to cease completely the use of U.S. territory for mounting operations; 2. He agree to cease . He would also agree to . cease completely . use of United States territory for . mounting operations, 2.2.
 3. He agree to keep his mouth shut, to keep away from Szulc, and be prepared to deny totally any statements on United States support attributed to him . 4. He agrees to keep out of the public eye, and to keep from talking about the U.S.
 All assistance will be cut off forthwith, and in the case of a violation of the first condition, all his equipment in the U.S. will be seized . He be made to understand that if these conditions are violated all assistance is cut off .
 "We should take no action pending the basic decision on policy toward autonomous groups in general. Regarding intercession with the Dominican authorities, we should not take any action," the government says .
 Ray Ray himself should, of course, make the specific request to the Dominican authorities . Ray should make the request himself .
 He must establish a base outside, and then we will help him as we have undertaken to do. He will then be able to help him establish his base outside of the country .
 McCone and Bundy were to inform Attorney General Kennedy to use U.S. law enforcement agencies to prevent such plans . As for rumors of assassination plots against Castro and selected Cuban leaders, they were to use United States law enforcement agents .
 McCone sent Bundy an August 19 memorandum reviewing the FBI�s investigation of reported exile assassination plans . Bundy sent the memo to the FBI on August 19 .

 U.S. help might take the form of cooperation in mounting coastal patrols and surveillance of arms shipments . United States help might be in form of surveillance and patrols .
 It was firm U.S. policy to keep Castro in Cuba and to make it clear that any effort by him to subvert or to threaten other countries would encounter a prompt reaction .
 President Orlich said he was providing some help to Cuban exile leaders . Orlich: "President Orlich is helping some help with Cuban exile leader"
 Secretary said the U.S. was trying to ensure that no Cuban exile activities originated on United States soil . The Secretary of State said the United States was . trying to . ensure no . Cuban exile activity originated on . United States .
 Most of the work to overthrow Castro will have to be done inside Cuba . Hit-and-run raids are not very effective since most work must be done in Cuba . The U.S. has not been able to get a hit on Castro .
 President Orlich asked about the possible whereabouts of new guerrilla activities . Orlich: "I don't know where are the whereabouts of the guerrilla activities"
 He was concerned about arms being smuggled from Panama to Colombia and from Bolivia to Argentina . He said arms smuggling was illegal in Panama and Bolivia .
 The Secretary of State said control of arms traffic required a great deal of careful organization . The Secretary said that control of . arms traffic . required a very careful organization.
 The Secretary then discussed on the impact of the defection of Fidel Castro’s sister, Juana . Fidel Castros sister Juana defected from Cuba .
 He indicated he was very much interested in her remarks regarding the use of Cuban embassies as centers of subversion . The Cuban embassy is a center for subversion in Cuba .
 Castro’s sister apologized for sharp exchanges between Figueres and Castro . Ambassador Facio recalled that when he had visited Cuba in March 1959 in the company of President Orlich and Jose Figuere, Castro�s sister .
 There was general agreement that the increasing number of Soviet trained students from Central America and other areas represented a threat . There was also an agreement that there was a threat posed by Soviet-trained students .
 The Costa Rican Government has tried by publicizing names of those taking such training to cut down the flow . It was noted that the Costa Rican government has tried to publicize names of the people who take training .
 The Secretary asked if the Government of Costa Rica had lists of all those who had been trained by communists, and urged that the Government continue to keep an eye on them after their return .
 OAS Foreign Minister’s meeting in Washington to discuss Venezuela . Secretary said he would appreciate Costa Rican efforts to try to influence two or three nations still opposed to action .
 President Orlich and Foreign Minister Oduber said that they would continue their efforts . President Olich said that he would continue his efforts .
 There was also general agreement that the resolutions should not be further watered down . There were also agreement that they should not have been watered down.
 The Secretary said that the recommendations by nations of the hemisphere to nations outside the hemisphere that they cut off commercial relations with Cuba, if approved, would have a very significant impact on European nations now trading with Cuba .
 They would probably think twice about continuing Cuban trade if it were to jeopardize their much greater trade with the rest of Latin America . The U.S. has a long history of Cuban trade with Latin America.
 We believe that there will be further erosion of popular support for his regime over the next year or two . We believe there is a further erosion in support for Mr Assad's regime .
 Unless he dies or is otherwise removed from the scene, however, we think the chances of an overthrow of the regime will remain slim . The chances of a major uprising against the regime during this period will remain very slim, we say .
 The regimes economic performancestill dismal after five and a half years of tryinghas resulted in a continuing loss of popular backing . The regime’s economic . performance has resulted in continued loss of public backing .
 Living conditions are depressed; rationing has become a way of life . Administration and management continue to be both inept and high-handed . The administration and management continues to be  inept .
 The Cuban regime has failed to deliver the economic benefits that it promised . The consequences of this failure are increasingly felt by most of the Cuban population . The regime's failure to deliver economic benefits is increasingly felt .
 We expect little, if any, increase in overall economic output during the rest of 1964 or in 1965 . Moreover, we expect little . if any increase in . economic output . in 1964 or 1965 .
 Shortages of foodstuffs and consumer goods are likely to become even more pronounced . Indeed shortages of food and other goods will likely become more pronounced, experts say .
 Even if this target is achieved, it would mean a small decline in per capita consumption, since the population is almost certainly increasing at a substantially greater rate . Even though this target has not been achieved, the Cubans have not often met plan goals in the past .
 Cuban sugar production in 1964 was about 3. million metric tons, the same as the 1963 crop . 1963 crop was the smallest in 18 years . Cuba's sugar production was estimated to be about 3 million tons .
 Cuban export earnings this year will be slightly below those of 1960 and 1961, but will be substantially better than in 1962 and 1963 because of abnormally high prices at which most of the 1964 crop was sold on future contracts during 1963 .
 Recent sharp declines in sugar futures make Cuban prospects for foreign exchange earnings much less promising for 1965, and probably for 1966 as well .
 World spot prices had hit a peak of 13 cents a pound a year ago and were still as high as 12 cents last November . Sugar futures for 1965 are running at 4. to 4.5 cents; sugar futures in 1965 are 4.2 cents .
 The Castro regime would have to expand sugar production by about 20 percent next year to earn as much in 1965 as this year . It would also have to sell the entire increase to the bloc at the six-cent price specified for Soviet purchases in the long-term Soviet-Cuban sugar
 There is no more than a remote chance that the 1965 harvest will be large enough to produce export earnings significantly above those of this year . The regime’s program of canefield expansion may permit a modest expansion in the 1965 sugar crop .
 Castro is pressing ahead with his program of socialization, relying increasingly on methods of compulsion and repression in carrying out it out . Castro's government has been in the grip of the Castro regime in Cuba for decades .
 Castro has not been able to put an end to internal anti-regime activity . Castro has been unable to put a stop to anti-government activity in Cuba .
 Small guerrilla bands continue to operate in the mountainous areas of Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente provinces .
 Covert and ""accidental"" sabotage by workers has been a factor in low productivity rates . Covert and "accidental" sabotage has been cited as a factor .
 The regime seems particularly concerned that an expansion of guerrilla activities in conjunction with a successful landing by Cuban exiles could trigger some kind of local revolt .
 We do not believe that the present capabilities of the exiles justify this fear, but we do think the fear is real . We do think that present capabilities do not justify the fear of exiles .
 Cuban military alert and mobilization that took place in May is likely to be the primary reason for the military alert . Indeed, it was almost certainly the main reason .
 The very fact that the regime is nervous and has moved during recent weeks to arrest and deal ruthlessly with small numbers of suspected agents and other opponents has probably increased its shortterm security . The regime has also moved to deal with smaller numbers of suspects and opponents .
 The large number of potential opponents of the regime within the country has never had much opportunity to organize for any unified action . The large and increasing number of people within the regime has never been able to organize against it .
 "The elaborate internal security machinery which now exists makes such organizational activity even more difficult and dangerous," says the author of the book . "Such organizational activity is even more dangerous," he says .
 The national intelligence and security organization, the Department of State Security, maintains units throughout the country . It has apparently been effective in infiltrating and exposing counter-revolutionary groups .
 The Committee for the Defense of the Revolution is a volunteer informant . It works closely with the huge and ubiquitous organization of volunteer informants . The Committee is based in New York City .
 In Cuba, informants appear to be active in almost every block of every Cuban city . They claim the Committee has a membership of almost a million and a half .
 In addition to spying and reporting on neighbors, they distribute food rationing cards, hand out propaganda, and organize ""voluntary work"" groups .
 A parallel informants role among the youth, particularly among students, is carried out by the Union of Young Communists .
 We doubt that contingencies like those mentioned above will develop in the next year or two . Unless Castro dies or is otherwise removed from office, we doubt any contingencies will develop .
 He has demonstrated a remarkable ability to preserve a workable degree of unity among the disparate groups involved in the regime . He has made the great bulk of the population accept the socialization and regimentation measures of the revolution .
 Castro’s power position in Cuba may be undermined, but the process would be likely to take some years . All this may change, and in these or other ways Castro�s power may be weakened, but it would take years to change .
 Tom Mann asked John Crimmins to do a paper for the Secretary addressed primarily to the Castro proposal that Cuba would call off its subversion if we would stop our support for Cuban exile raids . Tom Mann had asked Crimmins for a paper on Cuba's subversion .
 MFM /4/ believes Castro interview was timed with the MFM in mind . He regards this as especially important because he believes it was timed to coincide with the interview . Castro interview is especially important for MFM -4/ .
 Castro intimated that Cuba was disposed to begin negotiating its differences with the U.S. Castro also intimated he would be open to negotiating with the United States . Castro: Cuba is disposed to negotiate its differences .
 Castro has treaty obligations not to engage in subversive activitiesHavana Convention of 1928, OAS and UN Charter, NonIntervention Convention of 1936, etc. Castro has also treaty obligations to not engage in destabilizing activities .
 "We do not intend to let exiles make our foreign policy. For our part, we are already doing all we can to stop exile raids from U.S. soil," says Obama .
 In the very same interview he said he would continue moral support to Castro/Communist groups in Latin America . In the same interview, he also said that he would support Castro/communist groups .
 The Soviet Union promised in 1933 to discontinue subversive activities . The Union promised to end subversive activities in 1933 .
 Cuba cannot grow and prosper while fighting with Cubas traditional friend, the U.S. The Cuban leader seems to recognize that Cuba can't grow while he is fighting with the United States. He seems to be recognizing finally that Cuba cannot .
 This is further evidence that interAmerican policy on Castro has been effective . InterAmerican policy against Castro is effective, Obama administration says .
 Thomas Jefferson said people have a right to change their government if it no longer represents them . "We continue to believe as Thomas Jefferson did," said Jefferson . "People have a ... right to have their government changed"
 Even those Latin American countries which oppose collective action by the OAS assert the right of the Cuban people to depose Castro by revolution if he will not permit elections . The OAS says that even if he won't allow elections, the people can depose him by revolution .
 So far as we are concerned Cuban patriots may exercise their inherent right so long as they do not involve the United States RMS 277. So far, we are not concerned with the situation .
 President has requested that a careful study be made of all aspects of the problem of maintaining adequate assurance against an attempted reintroduction of offensive missiles into Cuba .
 He requests that this study be undertaken by representatives of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Director of Central Intelligence, with the State Department representative as chairman .
 This inquiry should assess such questions as the probability and prospect of a renewed Soviet attempt to introduce missiles, the different levels of assurance which might be achieved by various means of obtaining information . An increase or decrease in tension with Cuba might change the urgency of the problem .
 Group expected to work closely with U.S. Intelligence Board, government agencies involved in research .
 It is requested that the chairman of the group maintain liaison with my office, through Mr Peter Jessup and with me directly, as he thinks appropriate .
 It is not expected that this review group should reach final recommendations, but rather that it should examine all aspects of this question and prepare a report showing as clearly the various courses, with their premises and consequences .
 After a preliminary survey the chairman and I will agree on a completion date for this study . The chairman and the chairman of the board will agree to a completed date for the study .
 The bill was drafted by Bowdler and cleared by Assistant Legal Adviser for Inter-American Affairs Marjorie M Whiteman .
 We have consistently maintained the position that it is not in the United States interest to recognize a Cuban government-in-exile . The U.S. has consistently maintained its position that the U.K. should not recognize the Cuban government .
 The most formal public expression of our views was made by Assistant Secretary Martin in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees on May 22, 1963, in testimony .
 Recognition of a government-in-exile would give those in Cuba who are struggling against communism, or who might be disposed to turn against the regime, the idea that they are being disregarded and that they will have no role to play .
 A fundamental premise of our policy is that the Cuban people themselves will decide how they will achieve and organize their freedom . Those now within Cuba must have the major share of that responsibility, Obama says .
 The problem of finding a government capable of uniting a majority of the exiles is a most difficult, if not impossible task . The problem is uniting the majority of exiles .
 "Our consistent policy has been to recognize governments-inexile only when they have direct constitutional connection with the last constituted government of the country," he said .
 U.S. still recognizes the Castro regime as the Cuban Government . Cuba is responsible for its international obligations, including the protection of United States citizens, the U.N. says .
 To recognize a government-in-exile might put those rights in legal jeopardy . Recognition of a government in exile could put the rights of the government in jeopardy .
 There is a better than even chance that a government-in-exile would fall under the control of old-line, discredited Cuban politicians . Cuban politicians constitute a numerous, aggressive and often well-financed element of the Cuban exile community .
 Our experiences with the Cuban Revolutionary Council are a poor augury for relations with an even more formal body . Our experiences in the 19611962 period with the Cuba Revolutionary Councilthe nearest thing to a government-in-exileare poor auguries for relations
 If an acceptable alternative to Castro should arise within Cuba as a result of internal developments and should establish itself physically in some form as a provisional government, our ability to recognize it would be made much more difficult if we were already in relations with a government-in-exile .
 The exile government would probably also try to obtain representation in world bodies . The exiled government would try to get representation from world bodies, including the UN .
 Few if any of our Western European allies would recognize the government or support its replacement of Castro representatives in these organizations . Few, if any, of our allies would support the government's replacement .
 Only advantage to be derived from recognition of a Cuban exile government would be to remove legal obstacles to giving exile groups financial and material support for their activities against the Castro regime . Other than preventing Castro from bringing suit in the United States and claiming sovereign immunity in connection therewith, about the only
 Given the preponderant strength of Castros military forces in relation to what the exile government could muster, our decision to support the exiles would only make sense in the context of a broader determination on our part to take direct action against the Castro regime .
 In the absence of a clear decision to move directly against the present regime, the U.S. will not recognize a Cuban government-in-exile . The U.N. should not recognize the Cuban government in exile .
 On July 26, 1964, at the conclusion of the Ninth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States, held at the Pan American Union in Washington . Venezuelas complaint of December 3, 1963, against Cuba, after the latter was found to
 The Foreign Ministers found that the Government of Cuba had directed and sponsored subversion against Venezuela . Such subversion was an act of intervention and aggression, the Foreign Ministers said .
 The U.S. should suspend all trade with Cuba, except in foodstuffs, medicines, and medical equipment that may be sent to Cuba for humanitarian reasons . 3. That the governments of the American states suspend all their trade, whether direct or indirect, with Cuba .

 Notes on Luncheon Meeting attended by the President, Secretary McNamara, Secretary Rusk, McGeorge Bundy, Mr McCone . The luncheon was held in the Presidents private dining room .
 I reported on the withdrawals from Cuba following the substance of the attached memorandum . I reported that the withdrawals were withdrawn from Cuba .
 Khrushchev did not want a confrontation with the U.S. He knew such a confrontation would be created by a shoot-down of the U2, he says . I said that I believed that Khruschev did .
 All military units have been withdrawn from Cuba, all equipment was now in Cuban hands, all communications systems except for one Navy link were operated by the Cubans, and the 1500 to 2500 remaining Soviets were military advisors .
 Since the missile crisis of 1962, some 20,000 Soviet military personnel have left Cuba in four major withdrawal periods . The peaks occurred in November 1962, March 1963, November 1963, and June 1964 .
 At the end of 1963, as many as seven thousand Soviet servicemen remained on the island, we estimated . The estimated high of 22,500 troops in October 1962 was estimated to have been withdrawn .
 Twenty Soviet passenger ships have called at Cuban ports, 14 of them in the last three months . Since that estimate was made, there have been more than 20 Soviet ships .
 Few military passengers were on the ships calling between January and April . Military personnel departures were probably offset by arrivals .
 Only about 2,000 Soviet military technicians and advisors remain on the island . We believe that the last major withdrawal of Soviet military personnel has now been completed, the author says .
 All Soviet communications links within Cuba have been deactivated or turned over to the Cubans . Cuban forces have assumed full control over the operation of all Soviet weapons remaining on the island .
 National Intelligence Estimate/1/ NIE 8564 . Washington, August 5, 1964 .
 The United States Intelligence Board concurred in this estimate on August 5 . The U.S. intelligence board concurred with this estimate .
 To assess the Cuban situation and the outlook over the next year or two . The Cuban situation is the focus of this week's CNN.com program .
 Cuba's economic situation will be stagnant over the next two years, experts say . Cuba's downward trend of the Cuban economy seems to have slowed and perhaps levelled off, they say .
 Living levels are likely to become slightly lower, and shortages of foodstuffs, housing and many types of consumer goods will continue . Living levels will likely be slightly lower .
 Slight gains in industry are likely, but these will probably be offset by some decline in the agricultural sector . Agricultural sector is likely to see a decline in GDP growth .
 Export earnings in 1965 and 1966 are likely to be below 1964 levels . Lower sugar prices and poor prospects for substantially larger production of sugar and other export commodities .
 The value of total trade with the Free World can be expected to decline during the period .
 We believe that the Soviets and other Communist countries will provide sufficient credit assistance to prevent a seriously damaging drop in total imports . The Soviets and others will provide enough credit assistance, we say .
 In these circumstances, Cubas heavy economic dependence on the Communist world will continue . Cubas heavy reliance on Communist world is likely to continue, says Cuban president .
 Depressed levels of consumption, the imposition of work norms, and forced labor and security duties will tend to narrow the regimes popular support . The regime’s popularity is likely to be limited if it continues to suffer from depression .
 The huge security apparatus will almost certainly prevent popular dissatisfaction from bringing down the regime .
 We think it likely that a number of military officers have lost sympathy with certain of its policies, but we doubt that there is military disaffection on a scale sufficient to threaten Castro .
 Major deterioration in the internal situation or serious difficulties within the government could alter the picture, but would be unlikely to undermine Castro�s power position in less than several years .
 "We believe his death would lead, in fairly short order, to a power struggle of unpredictable outcome," says CNN.com .
 The Cuban armed forces are much the best-equipped in Latin America and, except for Brazil, the largest in the region . Cuba has the best armed forces in the world, except Brazil, and is the largest .
 Cuba's capabilities have continued to improve, chiefly as a result of the delivery of additional weapons from the USSR and Cuban acquisition of weapon systems formerly under Soviet control .
 The compulsory military service program, introduced last November, will probably cause an initial drop in the level of training and efficiency, but will allow improved selectivity of recruits for the active forces . It will eventually produce a much larger trained reserve force .
 Soviet MAAG-type presence, mostly technical and maintenance personnel, of about 2,000 will probably remain . Cuban armed forces remain dependent on the USSR for technical and material support to maintain their complex Soviet equipment .
 The Soviets are highly unlikely to reintroduce strategic weapons into Cuba, experts say . They have the technical capability to do so clandestinely, they say .
 They might use Cuba for support of their submarines, but so long as they calculate that the risk would be high, they would not push such a venture very far . The U.S. has not yet decided whether to use Cuba as a support base for its submarines .
 The Cuba-Soviet relationship remains intact, although frictions have continued . The relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union is still strong .
 Castro, though willing to lean to the side of the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet dispute, has refused to join in any formal condemnation of Peiping . Castro has refused in any official condemnation of the Chinese government .
 He is concerned lest a further improvement in US-Soviet relations leave his regime more isolated and exposed .
 The Soviets have little choice but to continue to support Castro . Though the Soviets almost certainly consider Castro to be erratic and undependable, he has little choice .
 The most explosive question in Soviet-Cuban relations, as well as between Castro and the US, is the continuation of U2 overflights . The most important question in relations between the two countries is whether to continue overflights, says CNN's John Avlon .
 Castro and Khrushchev conducted a program of warnings, threats, and compromise suggestions to induce the U.S. to desist . The two leaders have been in touch with the United States .
 It is almost certain that Cuba now has full control over the SAM system . Cuba has the capability to shoot down a U.2. U.S. aircraft .
 We believe that the Soviets can only give advice, backed up by their political and economic leverage, though we cannot wholly exclude the possibility that they have retained some sort of physical restraint on an actual firing .
 Castro does not intend to force the issue until after the U.S. elections, when he will seek UN action . Nevertheless, we believe that Castro . He will not push the issue into action until after after the United States .
 If this fails, there is considerable danger that he would order a shootdown, calculating that the U.S. would not retaliate in force . Or that, if it did, the resulting hue and cry would end the overflights .
 An impulsive reaction by Castro or even an unauthorized shootdown is always possible . The president is expected to make an impulsive move .
 Castro has a serious interest in improving relations with the U.S. as a means of reducing the pressures on his regime . Castro has also an interest in the US as a way to reduce pressure on him .
 Cuba's recent gestures are useful to build a record of reasonableness and flexibility in preparation for Cubas appeal to the UN on the U2 issue .
 There is little chance that he will accede at any early date to the conditions the United States has stated . He will probably make further overtures from time to time, but there will be little chance .
 Castro’s efforts to foment revolution in Latin America have suffered setbacks during the past year . Castros efforts have been met with setbacks in recent months . Castro has been trying to stir up a revolution in the region .
 He is probably somewhat less sanguine about the chances for quick success . He is likely to be more sanguid about the success of his side .
 He will almost certainly continue to provide aid and subversive training to potential revolutionaries . Nevertheless, he will probably continue to give aid and training .
 He may press for early aggressive action by some Castroist groups, even though their immediate chances seem poor . He may hope that their repression would eventually produce conditions more favorable for exploitation .
 Present statistics indicate that Free World exports to Cuba in 1964 will show an increase of roughly 80% over the 1963 figures . Exports to the Free World in 1964 are expected to increase by about 80% in 1964 .
 So far the domestic press has not focussed on this issue but there are indicators that our good luck will not hold out much longer . So far, the domestic media has not focused on the issue .
 State continues to work hard on the problem of keeping down trade with Cuba . State of Cuba has several strings left in its bow .
 The Secretary will be calling in the Ambassadors of the trading nations to emphasize the results of the recent OAS meeting and to once again request cooperation .
 State is encouraging other OAR nations to call in the Ambassadors of the trading nations to make a pitch similar to the Secretary’s. Second, State is encouraged to call the Ambassador of the countries to make the same pitch. State is also encouraging OARs to call
 These measures, if implemented, may not be effective in reducing trade with Cuba over the long term . These measures may or may not have been effective .
 Over the short term they will help only marginally in making the 1964 statistics more tolerable than they now appear to be . Over the long-term, the statistics will only make it easier to understand .
 Our reply to such a charge, among other things, might contain the following elements . Our reply might be that of a charge that the charge is based on the fact that we have no idea what happened .
 We should try to keep the statistics in the context of Free World trade with Cuba since 1960 . We should also keep the stats in context of the Free World Trade with Cuba .
 Cuba's prospects for improvement in the Cuban economy are poor, Cuban president says . Cuba's economy is not 100% effective, he says, but it has had a considerable impact .
 While our failures are well known, many of our successes cannot be made public . Also, we might background that while our failures . also . note that while . our successes are well . known , many of . their successes cannot . be revealed .
 We should make it clear that we and the other OARs have not given up and are continuing to exert pressure on the pertinent trading nations . We should be careful not to give up. We will continue to exert our pressure on relevant trading nations. We are not giving up .
 We might point out that the job is not an easy one since we are dealing with sovereign nations whose interests are often not the same as ours . We are, of course, dealing with . sovereign countries whose interests . often not . the same . as ours, we say .
 I have no strong feelings about the immigration status of Cuban exiles taking part in anti-Castro activities outside the U.S. territories . I'm not concerned with the status of ex-Cuban exiles in the United States .
 Cuban exile activities based in other U.S. republics should be looked at again, he says . He says, "After the first of the year, however, we should have another look at whether our interests are served by exile activities"
 Cuban exiles' activities do not do any real harm to the Castro regime, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter asks whether the assertion that these activities are a morale builder for anti-Castro Cubans inside Cuba is still valid .
 Castro may now have a pretext for appealing to the patriotism of the Cubans and presenting himself as the defender of Cuban sovereignty against the Colossus of the North . Castro's activities are on balance helpful to Castro by giving him a pretext .
 In the second place, I find that U.S. policy is astride two horses each veering off in different directions . In the first place, he finds that United States policy is on the wrong track .
 In the Foreign Ministers Meeting we took the position that the subversive activities in Venezuela amounted to Cuban aggression . In the . Foreign Ministers’ Meeting we . took the . position that . Venezuelas subversive activities . amounted to . Cuban aggression, the Foreign Minister said .
 It will become increasingly difficult to maintain this line and at the same time downplay the importance of extra legal activities directed against Castro and designed to bring about his overthrow .
 I only say we should have a careful look at them in the not-too-distant future . I'm not sure if we will be able to see them again in the near future .
 The Secretary said that he wished again to raise the matter of Cuba, since there were two new elements in the situation . Ambassador Sergio Fenoaltea, Italian Embassy Mr Hugh G Appling said he wished to discuss Cuba .
 The first was the meeting of the Ministers of the OAS in July and the second was the decline of Cubas credit rating . Cubas debt rating has been downgraded to a credit rating since 2008 .
 World sugar prices had come down from abnormal levels, Cuban production was down, and the Government of Cuba had to recognize that it had overreached its capabilities . Cuba's sugar production had been down, but the government had to accept that .
 The OAS Ministers were concerned at continuing Cuban interference in their internal affairs . The meeting had been to restrain them from extreme measures, the minister says .
 Feelings were very strong in the hemisphere and it was hoped that friends would help with the problem . Feelings are very strong, and it is hoped that the problem will be solved .
 The resolution which was adopted nearly exhausted peaceful remedies . The hemisphere was determined that Castro must stop his troublemaking . The resolution was adopted in a resolution which had exhausted peaceful solutions .
 Cuba is seeking to avoid opportunities for Cuba to escape from pressure, says Cuban president . Cuba is looking to avoid any opportunities for the country to escape pressure, he says .
 Secretary said he did not wish to suggest that Italy had not been helpful . The Secretary of State said he would not want to suggest Italy was not helpful .
 Italian trade with Cuba was small and Italian imports were down but exports were up . We noted that Italian trade between Cuba and Italy was small .
 We also appreciated Italian support in NAC and FIATs responsiveness to our concern about their Cuban deal . The Italian government is concerned about the deal .
 Italian shipping companies had been assuring that their ships would be out of Cuba trade by the end of the year .
 The Secretary of State said that we might at some future time take up the matter again in NATO and wanted the Ambassador to have this background .
 The Secretary of State said there were two aspects of the problem which were not negotiable . The Secretary said the Secretary said there are two parts of the . problem which are not negoliable .
 The first was the presence of the Soviet military in Cuba and the second was Cuban interference in the affairs of other countries . The first and second was the Cuban interference into other countries' affairs, the Cuban president says .
 There had recently been substantial reduction in the number of Soviet forces in Russia .
 These are largely technicians and advisers and did not appear to appear to be organized into units . These were largely technicians, advisers .
 We had no evidence that the Cubans were changing their policy to end interference in other countries . We had 'no evidence' that the Cuban government was changing its policy to stop foreign interference, he said .
 With the termination of diplomatic relations, the misuse of their embassies was decreasing . The misuse of embassies is decreasing in the use of embassies, according to experts .
 Ambassador said he had heard that the United States preferred that some Soviet troops remain in Cuba as a moderating influence . Ambassador: U.S. prefers that some Russian troops remain as a moderate influence .
 We had expressed our concern that, after Soviet withdrawal, sophisticated arms would remain in Cuban hands and that they might use them irresponsibly . We had only expressed concern that such arms might remain in Soviet hands .
 He concluded that the Soviet presence in Cuba cuts across a hundred and fifty years of history and that stability could not be achieved as long as it continued .
 Ambassador said he would report Secretarys remarks faithfully . Ambassador said that he would be reporting the Secretary�'s remarks . Ambassador: "He would report the Secretary's remarks faithfully"
 Allende's victory could have as a rebuff to Castro, Castro who had made an enormous effort in support of Allende, Allende . He and the Secretary agreed on the importance of Freis victory in Chile .
 Ambassador says some countries lack legal means to enforce restrictions on trade with Cuba . Ambassador: Some countries lacked legal means of enforcing restrictions on Cuba trade .
 The Secretary of State said we did not have such collective action in mind now . The means and problems would be different in every country, he said .
 One tool generally available to governments was the possibility of refusing to guarantee credits for trade with Cuba . One tool available was to refuse to guarantee credit for Cuba .
 Secretary Rusk scheduled a series of meetings with Ambassadors from Italy, Canada, Spain, United Kingdom, France, Lebanon, Japan, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, and West Germany .
 The Italian Ambassador was the first one seen . The Spanish Ambassador and the Canadian Ambassador were also seen on September 9 .
 Rusk again mentioned the OAS meeting on Cuba and its trade resolutions . In his meetings with the French Ambassador on September 10, Rusk mentioned the meeting .
 The Ambassador responded that French trade with Cuba was insignificant . The ambassador said that trade between France and Cuba is insignificant .
 Ambassador described his last conversation with the Secretary concerning Cuba on February 19 . Ambassador recalled that Rusk had expressed concern about the sale of Belgian locomotives to Cuba .
 The Ambassador stated that the Belgian Government had intervened to block credit for that sale, because of its desire to work closely with the United States . The Ambassador said the Belgian government had intervened to block credit .
 The Secretary said he wished to take up with the Ambassador, as he was doing with the Ambassadors of several other countries, the Cuban problem in the light of the deliberations of the Meeting of OAS Foreign Ministers in July .
 Several Ministers in the course of the meeting had referred to Cuban activities in their countries also, he said .
 The seriousness with which the Ministers viewed Cuban interference was demonstrated by the fact that the sanctions imposed on Cuba about exhausted the peaceful measures which remained available to the inter-American system . The seriousness shown by the seriousness of the Ministers .
 The Ministers hoped that Castro would heed the warning and thus avoid a dangerous situation . The Ministers hope that Castro will heed the warnings .
 The Secretary of State made clear to Cuba and the USSR that one of the two nonnegotiable elements in any discussion of improved U.S.-Cuban relations was the cessation of Cuban interference . The other was the Soviet military presence in Cuba, the Secretary said .
 The Secretary referred to the paragraph of the basic resolution of the MFM which sought demonstrations of solidarity from non-OAS states .
 The measure arose from the serious concern and initiative of Latin members of the Alliance, he said . He pointed out that this measure, like the others adopted at the meeting, was not imposed by the United States .
 The paragraph as finally adopted represented a moderation of a proposal to interrupt trade by OAS members with countries trading with Cuba . Secretary added that, in fact, the proposal was a moderation .
 Cuban Government facing foreign exchange stringencies as a result of sharp drop in world sugar prices . Low sugar production, low sugar production and possible over-extension of purchasing in the Free World .
 The Cuban credit position would be correspondingly impaired, he said . He commented that the Cuban credit would be affected by the changes .
 Secretary of Spain calls on Spain to look at the Cuban problem to see if there are ways of indicating its solidarity with the OAS countries .
 He complimented the Spanish Foreign Minister on his remarkable achievements in creating a new respect for Spain, particularly among the OAS countries .
 He made clear that he did not wish to urge any particular steps on the Spanish Government but to suggest their consideration of the new situation .
 The Secretary stated that the Spanish Government might wish to review its trade relations with Cuba . The Secretary of State said the Spanish government might review trade relations .
 Spain’s commerce with Cuba was substantially higher than a year ago, he said . Spains commerce between Cuba and Spain is substantially higher this year than last year, he added .
 Ambassador attributed Spain's increased purchases of Cuban sugar to the drop in the Spanish sugar beet crop . He expressed the belief that this years crop would be better this year .
 Soviet aid to Cuba continued to be substantial, but the Cuban economy continued to decline . The supply of spare parts, for example, becoming an increasingly important matter .
 Ambassador asked whether there had been concrete results from the OAS Ministerial Meeting yet . Ambassador said there were no concrete results yet from the meeting yet .
 Castro’s sister had described the three Cuban Embassies as ""nests of subversion" in Latin America . Castros sister described the Embassies in Latin American as "nests" of subverted .
 Some of the OAS states had seen some advantage in keeping at least one Latin American Embassy in Havana for purposes of asylum and observation . He added that we were not overly concerned that Mexico had not yet broken relations .
 OAS members were not unduly disquieted by Mexico’s position at present . We did not know what Mexicos further steps might be, but the OAS did not think it would be a surprise .
 Ambassador asked whether the President would take this matter up with the President of Mexico when they meet . Ambassador asked if he would take it up with Mexican President when they met . Ambassador: "I'm sure he'll take this issue up with Mexico when we meet"
 The Secretary said he thought not since the situation had just been discussed at the OAS meeting . With a change in government due in December, it seemed improbable that President Johnson would take this up with President Lopez Mateos .
 The Ambassador remarked that Spain had been able to rescue many Cubans . The Ambassador said that many of the Cubans were rescued .
 Plane load of 81 refugees had been flown out this week, including some who had been condemned to death . For instance, 81 refugees were flown out of the country this week . Some of the refugees were condemned to be executed .
 He suggested that because of its special relationship it might be possible to speak frankly to the Cubans to tell them that they must stop their interference in other countries .
 The Ambassador asked whether we had evidence of further arms shipments from Cuba into other countries . The ambassador asked whether there were any evidence of more arms shipments .
 Mr Crimmins said that Venezuela was the only well-established, large-scale case . He said there were some other indications of Cuban arms on a minor scale in northern Argentina .
 The Secretary repeated that he hoped the Government of Spain would take a new look at the situation and measures .
 Ambassador said he would report his conversation with the Secretary faithfully to his Government . Ambassador said: "I would report it faithfully to my Government"
 Ambassador Anatoliy F Dobrynin came in to see me today pursuant to an appointment which he had made almost a week ago . Ambassador-at-Large Llewellyn E Thompson, Ambassador- at-Large, Department of State . Cuba's ambassador: "Ambassador Dob
 He said he wished to talk to me entirely on a personal basis about Cuba . The Cuban president said he wanted to talk about Cuba in a personal way .
 His remarks were rather vague but his purpose seemed to be to express concern about raids on Cuba, the training of emigrant groups in Central America and elsewhere, and some rumor that some Central American countries might take some forceful action .
 In the course of the conversation, he mentioned the Artime group and another exile leader whose name he said he thought was Olivo . In the past, he also said he believed Olivo was an exile leader .
 CIA's Deputy Directorate of Plans met with Nicaragua's dictator, General Anastasio Somoza, on September 17 at Friendship Airport in Miami . King of the CIA’s Deputy Director of Plans meets with the dictator .
 King told Somoza that he ""could count on a sympathetic understanding in Washington"" if he dropped support for Artime . King said he could count on "sympathetic understanding" in Washington if he backed Artime. King was assassinated in June 1944 .
 FitzGerald said Somoza told King he had information that Castro would attack the exile camps in Nicaragua . The minutes of a joint ARACIA meeting on October 1 said that the United States would respond .
 I said that as he knew we had expressed ourselves as being opposed to these hit-and-run raids and pointed out how embarrassing it was to us that a Spanish ship had been sunk . I said he knew as he . knew that as . knew we . had expressed themselves as being
 I said we had taken strict measures to prevent the use of our territory by these groups . I said I understood that these measures had been effective .
 At the same meeting it "was generally agreed that the United States should not lend weight to the case against Artime" The findings should remain "as indeterminate as is plausible"
 He indicated that the Soviet Government had remained relatively quiet about the activities directed against Cuba . The Soviet Government did not want to inject this issue into the American political campaign .
 I said that while I assumed that all of our policies would be under review after the election, I did not believe there would be any change in our attitude toward hit-and-run raids on Cuba . I said in conclusion that .
 It has bogged down, not because of personality differences and interagency disagreements, but rather because of technical problems which prevent the accurate judgment factor from being applied, says David Cameron . Mr Cameron: "My present judgment is that it has . blocked the accurate judgement factor from applying"
 It has not been determined whether the JCS will permit the most sensitive ECM techniques to be used in peacetime reconnaissance U-2s over Cuba .
 Agreement does not exist as to whether a mix of surveillance methods is advisable or not . Agreement is not known as whether a mixture of surveillance is advisable .
 Ambassador Thompson advocates a reaffirmation of UN ground inspection in Cuba . Ambassador Thompson: U.N. ground inspection of Cuba is a priority .
 Ambassador Thompson may lack the two-fisted authoritarian approach required to hammer out the kind of paper you want from this committee . Another factor may be that Ambassador Thompson, a reflective thinker out loud, doesn't think out loud . The committee consists of Tom Hughes, Kitchen, Weiss and Lind
 "I would recommend that the work of this committee be further refined now that the election period is over," says the senator .
 In other words, the question should be can we live after November 4th with any degree of lessened assurance? The question is whether we can live with less certainty after the election .
 The committee should dispense with such matters as what to do after a shootdown, etc. etc. and concentrate on what are the minimal requirements and what is the minimal means to dissatisfy these . The committee of the committee should focus on what is needed and what can be done to
 The time is getting short; the UN may debate the matter before we have your paper . The time for the debate may be getting short .
 Print from a copy that bears this typed signature . Peter Jessup /3/ .
 John Crimmins, Des FitzGerald, Joe Califano, and I met to talk about miscellaneous Cuban problems .
 Crimmins said that we have completed our ""investigation"" of the Aranzazu incident . The Spanish have now asked us to give them our evaluation of the various reports we have furnished to them .
 The general pitch he will probably want to use will take into account such facts as that we want to give the Spanish the minimum necessary to keep them from thinking that we are trying to deceive them . The Spanish, themselves, probably evaluate Artime as the prime suspect .
 Cuban exiles may have sunk the Aranzazu, but it's probably more likely that the exiles did it, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: It's unlikely that the Cubans sunk the ship, not the Cuban ex-Cubans .
 There are a number of exile groups that have the capability of doing the job . Second, there are also groups that can do the job. Second, the exile groups have the ability to do the same .
 The fact that Artimes boat was in Curacao would seem to rule him out . Even if this could be explained, we could still not prove that he is the culprit . But the fact that . Artime’s boat . was in curacao,
 John Crimmins plans to clear his talking points with the Special Group before he talks to the Spanish . Crimmins says he will speak with the Spanish Special Group to clear talking points .
 Des feels that we should let this contact develop and, in this connection, he believes that the Special Group should permit the continuance of our support to Artime for another 60 or 90 days . If absolutely necessary, allow Artime to make one more attack on Cuba, Des says .
 If we drop Artime precipitously, the dissident group in Cuba will assume that Artime is not worth contacting . Their willingness to express dissidence may tend to dry up, says John Defterios .
 Des emphasized that he is no great admirer of Artime and that the above is not an Agency device to keep Artimes group alive . Des said he is not great admirers of the late Artime .
 Des also mentioned the possibility of passing on to Dorticos, in an unattributable, deniable fashion . The U.S. cannot live with Fidel Castro, it might well be able to live with him, Des says . Des: "While the United States cannot live
 Des feels that Cuba is in terrible shape, that Dorticos knows it, and that a move like this could conceivably produce a big dividend . Des says he feels that the Cuban government is in a terrible shape and that it knows it .
 At best, it will start Dorticos plotting, at worst, sow seeds of dissension and distrust . At worst it will help sow some seeds of dissent and distrust in the U.S.
 Des was very hopeful that Cuba will be in very bad economic shape by the end of 1965 . Some of this is going in already, and some is on the way, Des says .
 Des said that the effect on large amounts of Cuban machinery could be brutal . Emphasizing the extreme sensitivity of the operation, Des said .
 The point was made that there was, these days, a general recognition by the European missions in Cuba that the Cuban economic situation is grim and that, in fact, the isolation policy is not entirely a farce .
 To some extent, this realization coincided with the timing of the recent Cuban restrictions on credit . "To some extent," this realization coincides with the recent restrictions," he says .
 /5/ suggested that the British would be pleased to act as a middle man for a dialogue between the U.S. and Cuba . John Crimmins: Patrick Gordon-Walker in his meeting with Secretary Rusk .
 If we want to establish a dialogue with Castro, there are better channels than the British. Among other things, if we want a dialogue, there is better channels, the UK.
 The group agreed that, with November 3 behind us, we can usefully do some basic review work on Cuba .
 John Crimmins agreed to write a paper which would outline the major problems and the possible options, including accommodation, to this end .
 This will be ready in a few days time and will be distributed for comment . This is expected to be published in the next few days .
 Des FitzGerald said we should consider the re-institution, in the near future, of the ""unilateral"" CIA-directed covert program which had scored a number of hits .
 The group agreed, however, that a decision on this should probably wait until some of the basic review work on Cuba had been completed .
 Meeting at the White House12 Noon in attendance . President-elect, Vice-President-Elect, Secretary Rusk, Secretary Ball, Secretary McNamara, Secretary Vance, McGeorge Bundy, McCone .
 Rusk outlined the work done by the Thompson Committee on the question of overflights of Cuba, explaining the position that Castro had taken, forecasting debate in the United Nations . Rusk also explained the alternatives open to us such as satellites, drones, balloons, or the Oxcart .
 McNamara suggested consideration of a launch pad at Cape Kennedy for an East-West satellite mission . McNamara advocated satellites, suggesting consideration of the launch pad .
 Rusk then asked for an explanation by me of a plan developed by CIA to fly over the unprotected zones . Rusk: 'I don't know why I'm flying over the protected zones'
 I explained the plan in considerable detail, using maps indicating that U2s could fly and photograph 80% of the island and remain out of range of the SAMs . I explained this plan in .
 This would only cover 30% of the priority targets and would not cover the major military or population concentrations . However, this would only be limited to 30% targets .
 I indicated that the mounting of a satellite 112B camera for oblique photography would give us useable photography over all of the defended areas with resolution of about 5.5.0 .
 This would be better than satellites and could be synchronized with weather . It would be a better system than satellites . This would also be able to synchronise with weather.
 I raised the danger of the redeployment of SAMs, indicating that such a move by Castro could be detected by the U2s if they were equipped with available warning systems . Such a move could also be detected if they are equipped with warning systems, I
 I concluded by stating that I had less confidence in the product from satellites than indicated by Secretary McNamara, that the use of satellites over Cuba would deprive us of some capability over USSR and Communist China .
 I explained in some detail the innumerable times I had gone before Committees of Congress to discuss Cuban missile rumors and had disprove them satisfactorily with U2 photography . The Cuban missile was a major source of controversy .
 The President asked if I was positive that there were no missiles in Cuba, President Obama said . President Obama asked if he was certain that there was no missile in Cuba .
 All missiles which we had seen had been removed, all missile sites under construction had been destroyed and were non-existent . All secure areas obviously built for nuclear warhead storage were destroyed and no new ones had appeared .
 The redeployment of the SAMs, which left the logical missilelaunching areas unprotected, made me think the Cubans and the Soviets did not intend to reintroduce missiles at the present time . Finally, the redeployments of SAMs, made the .
 There was no decision except to explore the subject further and to continue U2 surveillance on the most modest reasonable basis subject to further review .
 The purpose of reconnaissance was to produce intelligence on the presence of, or the introduction of, offensive missiles, offensive aircraft or other weapons or weapons systems of sufficient range to pose a threat .
 Requirements for overflights, whether by manned aircraft, satellites, balloons, drones, etc., should be governed by this criteria . The criteria should be applied to overflights .
 Collateral intelligence would be useful, such as information on military encampments, equipment, deployments, etc., in studying Cuba, but should not govern as criteria for establishing requirements for reconnaissance .
 This criteria should be passed to COMOR and should be discussed with General Carroll . General Carroll should discuss the criteria with COMOR .
 Rusk stated that he had had a long meeting with Dobrynin and had been told that Castro had stopped all subversive activities and efforts against Latin America and had insisted to the Soviets that neither he nor his government are engaged in any way in such nefarious operations .
 Castro Cubans have been accused of accelerating activities by the Castro regime in Cuba . The Cuban government has been blamed for a series of incidents in the past year .
 I would expect a continuation of such rumors and statements by individuals or members of the Congress similar to those we have witnessed in the last two years, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "I would expect the same things to continue to happen"
 Satellite photography will make some input into our intelligence on Cuba . It will not be conclusive because of the resolution of KH4 and the small area coverage of KH7. Satellite photography is not conclusive .
 We expect disappointments from satellite photography because of uncertain weather conditions encountered in Cuba and the impossibility of synchronizing satellite missions with Cuban weather . Also expected to be disappointing for satellite photography due to uncertain weather .
 It should be noted that every mission targeted against Cuba will involve sacrifices of intelligence gathering capabilities on the Soviet Union and Communist China . The mission will also sacrifice intelligence gathering capability on Soviet Union .
 An east-west orbit would be useful but expensive . Mission would cover Cuba more satisfactorily than the present north-south orbit . Such an orbit would not produce intelligence of particular interest in other parts of world .
 A satellite 112B camera can be mounted in a U2 on an angle and thus photography of the defended areas of Cuba as well as the undefended areas can be had with photographic resolution of about 5 feet .
 Jessup and Thompson, Vance, and McCone were drafted by Jessup on December 4 . They were distributed to Thompson and Vance, but not the other three .
 The paper ""Proposed Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations into Cuba during December and 17 January 1965"" /2/ was approved by telephonic vote on 3 December 1964 .
 The CIA paper dated 30 November 1964 entitled ""Proposed Take Over of the Cuban Merchant Ship Rio Caonao by the Artime Group"" was discussed by the principals with a marked lack of enthusiasm for the concept .
 Mr McCone stated he could not view this proposal favorably and he would prefer that Artimes energies be channeled into a commando effort more susceptible to guidance and control . e. e. McCone said he could . not view the proposal favorably .
 Mr McNaughton stated he understood that this paper was to be tabled until Mr Vances return but he would record the views of those present . Mr Vance’s return was not to be discussed until he returned .
 Committee Secretary determined that if there had been some votes in favor, the matter should be postponed until Mr Vance was heard, but since the attitude was overwhelmingly negative, this constituted a veto . g. g.
 In response to a question, indicated that when informed of the United States attitude on this operation, he felt Artime would abandon the idea, but he could offer no guarantee that this would be the case . Also indicated Artime was farther along in his operation with internal dissidents and was shortly
 Mr McCone urged that the pace not slacken in the preparation of a Cuba after Castro study . The study is under the aegis of the Coordinator for Cuban Affairs .
 He and Tom Mann are very interested to hear what Guevara wants to say to us if he does want to say something to us .
 Lisa Howard is so subjectively wound up in rapprochement that one would never know what Guevara is saying and what Lisa is interpreting . Howard should not be seen as a middleman in the negotiations, Howard says .
 If Lisa Howard calls me back, I will simply tell her that I have nothing to tell her . "I will let her know if and when I do," she says .
 The main problem is to ascertain the truth, whether Che really has something to say to us or whether this is Lisa Howard building bridges, says Howard . Howard: "I don't know if Che has anything to say"
 If it is true that the Cubans want to talk to us, we prefer not to talk through unofficial third parties . The Cuban government would also indicate that, if it was true, it would not talk to them, it is not a secret .
 Senator McCarthy outlined the main points of his December 16 conversation with Che Guevara, Cuban Minister of Industry .
 Senator said he believed the purpose of the meeting was to express Cuban interest in trade with the United States . The Senator said the meeting is to express Cuba's desire to trade in the U.S. and recognition of the Cuban regime .
 Cuban Regime interested in reviving trade relations with the U.S. to obtain convertible currency . Mr Ball agreed this was plausible, saying it was plausible .
 Guevara probably recognized that any dealings with the United States would add respectability to the regime in the eyes of other Latin American States, he said .
 Guevara told Senator McCarthy the Alliance for Progress would fail because it merely underwrites vested interests and the status quo . The Alliance will fail because of vested interests, he said .
 He said Venezuela and the Central American States in particular needed revolutions . Venezuela and Central American states in particular need revolutions, he said .
 Chile was one state that was undertaking reforms that might make a revolution unnecessary . Chile is one of several countries undergoing reforms that could make it unnecessary .
 Chile would recognize Cuba if it were not for U.S. pressure, he says . Chile would have recognized Cuba if not for United States pressure . Chile is one of the world's most populous countries .
 Guevara did not attempt to conceal the subversive activities which Cuba was undertaking, he says . He says he did not try to hide the Cuban government's subversive activities . He said: "It was not a secret that Cuba was taking part in its subversive activities"
 He explicitly admitted that they were training revolutionaries and would continue to do so . He said they would continue training revolutionaries .
 He felt that this was a necessary mission for the Cuban Government since revolution offered the only hope of progress for Latin America . He said that revolution was the only chance of progress in Latin America.
 Guevara attacked U.S. overflights but not in particularly belligerent terms . He attacked United States overflights, but not belligerently .
 He said Cuba had the means to shoot down the planes, but had not taken any action against the U.S. He said that Cuba had not acted against the United States . The Cuban government has not responded to the threat .
 He insisted that there was no juridical basis for the overflights and that such a juridic basis was not furnished by OAS approval . The overflights were not approved by the OAS .
 The helicopter was allowed to leave Cuban territory after some talk of firing upon the helicopter, Cuban official says .
 Most of Cubas enemies worked for the oil and power companies, he said . Cubas enemies work for the power and oil companies, according to the Cuban president .
 He said the regime could identify them and they knew they would be shot if they resorted to sabotage . He said they knew the regime would shoot them if they used sabotage .
 Guevara took issue with a statement that Ambassador Stevenson had made that the U.S. was not withholding shipments of drugs to Cuba . Ambassador Stevenson made the statement that the United States had made .
 Mr Mann commented that drug shipments may have been cut back and that this was one area in which the Cubans could score on us . Mr Mann said drug shipments were cut back .
 Mr Ball said there was no reason why we should not sell drugs or medicines to Cuba . Mr Mann said he would look into the matter and said he will look into it .
 Guevara told the Senator that while conditions in Cuba were not good, there was no question of the regime collapsing . He said conditions in the country are not currently good, but conditions are improving .
 Cubans who did not like life on the island are free to leave, he says . On the question of refugees, he said Cubans were free to escape the island .
 Guevara also said the regime did not want any refugees returned to Cuba . Guesvara said Cuba does not want refugees returning to the country .
 He mentioned in passing that they had more problems with Protestants than with Catholics .
 On free elections, Guevara said these had not taken place because the revolution had not fully evolved . He said these were not free elections because of the revolution's lack of progress .
 Mr Ball asked if any references were made to Cubas relationship to Moscow . Mr Ball: Cubas relationship with Moscow has been strained by its relationship with Russia .
 Mr Ball said he believed the USSR was becoming fed up with Cuba but felt compelled to continue supporting it . Cuba was the first country to go communist without pressure of the Red Army .
 Mr Ball emphasized the danger of meetings such as that which the Senator had had with Guevara .
 There was suspicion throughout Latin America that the U.S. might make a deal with Cuba behind the backs of the other American States . The United States and Cuba have been at odds for years .
 Mr Ball pointed out that Guevara could not move about without a great many people knowing where he was and whom he was seeing . Mr Ball said that he would not be able to move around without people knowing who he was .
 McCarthy agreed, mentioning the large number of police cars that had gathered when he met Guevara . McCarthy agreed that police cars had gathered at the time of the meeting .
 Mr Ball asked McCarthy to get in touch with him if any further contacts with Guevara were contemplated . Mr Ball said McCarthy should contact him if he wants any further contact .
 Nothing should be publicly said about the McCarthyGuevara meeting . Meanwhile it was essential that nothing be publicly revealed about the meeting .
 John Crimmins gave me a brief read-out 2 on the meeting Senator McCarthy had with George Ball about meeting with Che Guevara . McCarthy met with Ball about McCarthys meeting with . Ball .
 State feels that the conversation was entirely Lisa-generated and that Che really had nothing to tell us . After listening to McCarthy, State felt that the discussion was all about Lisa McCarthy .
 Latin America, with the possible exception of Chile, is going to collapse, says President Obama . Latin America will collapse, he says, but not all of it .
 Resumption of trade with the United States would be good but Cuba can get along without it . Cuba can't get along with the U.S. without it, Cuban president says .
 If the McCarthy/Che conversation does become public, it could cause us some problems . McCarthy will be viewed by some as an envoy from the Administration .
 Our line presumably will be to simply stick to the facts, i.e. that we dont control U.S. Senators and newspaperwomen . The Senator did not ask for our recommendation before he had his talk with Guevara, he says .
 The only plus from the McCarthy/Che meeting is that it was probably an eye-opener for McCarthy . About the only plus is that the meeting was probably a meeting of McCarthy and Che .
 The recommendations in the CIA paper of 6 January 1965 entitled, ‘Activities of Manuel Artime Buesa During December and Early January; Contact with Military Dissidents Inside Cuba, /2/ were discussed at length and approved with the proscriptions .
 Rolando Cubela is identified in the January 6 CIA paper as ""a representative of an internal military dissident group, which is plotting to overthrow Castro."" /4/ one of the three groups that Cubela said were involved in a coup against Castro .
 Mr FitzGerald’s estimate was that these individuals were genuine disenchantees positively identified from other sources as being anti-Castro . He said they were genuine disenchantes .
 Ambassador Thompson wondered if open civil war would be a desirable objective, and suggested a Soviet reaction in other theatres in that event . Ambassador Thompson suggested a possible Soviet reaction .
 Mr FitzGerald requested that consideration be given to reiteration by higher authority of a theme made by the late President Kennedy in a speech about a week before he died, to the effect that there are a lot of people in Cuba with whom the United States is prepared to deal .
 Mr Bundy requested a submission of draft language from Mr FitzGerald which could be used by higher authority in response to a planted question at a forthcoming press conference . The Committee members were receptive to this concept, Mr Bundy said .
 McCone wanted the committee to know that dealing with autonomous exiles was, unfortunately, a part of a previously approved total program against Cuba . Artime constituted a persistent menace, he said .
 /7/ concentration of development of the internal operation and curtailment of grandstand operations to augment his image . Mr McCone’s suggestion that additional payments for . two or three months could be offered in exchange for . acceptance of restrictive conditions by Artime .
 Ambassador Thompson reserves the right to refer the Committee position to Assistant Secretary of State Mann prior to signing off . Ambassador Thompson reserved the right .
 Mr McCone impressed on the Committee the difficulty of dealing with the autonomous exile groups . He said it was "extremely dangerous and of questionable effectiveness"
 Incidents beyond the control of CIA or USG might occur which could be very embarrassing, f. f. The CIA and USG could be at risk of embarrassing embarrassment .
 Mr McCone explained that support of the autonomous exile groups was part of a 6-point program . The program involved propaganda, psychological efforts, infiltration, infiltration and directed sabotage operations, economic denial, and autonomous operations .
 As time passed, some of the ""package" was discontinued for policy reasons . Some of the directed sabotage operations were discontinued .
 The effectiveness of autonomous operations has been greatly reduced and the danger of embarrassment enhanced . The risk of embarrassment has been enhanced by the loss of control of the operation .
 Artime is not responsive to persuasion or direction and thus constitutes a persistent menace . Furthermore, Artime does not respond to direction or persuasion .
 Paragraph 3.f. of the minutes dated 8 January thus becomes paragraph 3.i. Paramount of minutes from the minutes of the meeting . Paramount's minutes date from 8 January is now paragraph 3 .i. The minutes of this meeting are published in the New Year's
 In the opinion of the Executive Secretary, this amplification is completely in accord with what transpired at the meeting .
 The memorandum was prepared by Crimmins, following a meeting among Rusk, Thompson, Hughes, and Mann . Crimmins prepared the memo .
 Artime will be notified without delay that, in conformity with previous statements made to him, United States support for his group will be terminated as of February 28, with phasing out of United States assistance .
 Nicaraguan, Costa Rican and Dominican Governments will be informed discreetly, but clearly, that we are in no way supporting Artime . Any arrangements made with, or facilities provided to, Artime by the Governments concerned are strictly between them and him . We would understand and would have no
 The individual would return to the United States, but instead of publishing anything about his Soviet visit, he would visit Florida, the Caribbean area, and Washington . He would try to make it appear as if secret negotiations about Cuba had been conducted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union
 Mr FitzGerald said that the Agency was withdrawing the proposed use of former Senator Kenneth Keating . The Agency hoped to build a similar confusion operation around an actual trip to Moscow planned by lawyer James Britt Donovan .
 Ambassador Thompson asked if this would not preclude Mr Donovans usefulness in other possible missions in the future . Ambassador Thompson said Donovan�s usefulness will not preclude him from future missions . Donovans usefulness could be limited, he said .
 There are no plans in sight to make use of Mr Donovans services, says Mr Donovan .
 The memorandum stated that if an operation was not considered acceptable, the CIA be authorized to begin reduction of its commitments in the paramilitary field . ""If an operation of this type of this kind of . operation is not . considered acceptable," the memo stated .
 Mr FitzGerald stated that keeping paramilitary assets in being is an expensive process . Adiscussion followed in which he said that such a shelf life is limited in duration .
 He emphasized that only the lesser motivated types are willing to remain on ice indefinitely . Better caliber people drift away, he said, from the ice .
 Mr Vance felt it important to preserve the capability despite its tendency to waste away . While accepting this difficulty, Ambassador Thompson said this asset could be needed in the future .
 Mr Bundy directed that these arrangements be established and completed by the end of April . The arrangements should have been established by April 30 .
 Ambassador Thompson asked some questions concerning the internal operation of Cubela . Ambassador Thompson said there was no United States commitment to Cubela via Artime .
 Aid should be continued for another 2 months to give Artime time to develop his potential for action with Cuba . FitzGerald stated that the Agencys view was that the aid should continue for 2 months .
 The U.S. should not be involved with another exile organization, the group says . It was the consensus of the group that either-you-do-or-you dont and that the United States shouldn't be involved .
 The committee agreed to reimburse Major Oliva some $17,000 and to offer Oliva himself some help in finding a job commensurate with his talents . The committee also offered Oliva a job offer .
 Minutes of 7 January 1965 authorized a proposed draft of a planted question and answer on the subject of Cuba for a forthcoming Presidential press conference . Paragraph 3.d. of the minutes of the . minutes of 7 . January 1965 .
 The purpose of this question and answer was to reiterate a theme made by the late President Kennedy8 a week before he died . The late president said there were Cubans within Cuba with whom the United States would be willing to deal .
 Mr Bundy directed that the draft be circulated to members for comment at a future meeting .
 There was some doubt expressed whether a press conference at this time could appropriately generate a question on Cuba . There was also some doubt that the question would be appropriate .
 There will be no attempt during the talks to fix a common policy toward Cuba . Lines of policy will inevitably be discussed, but it is clearly understood by all concerned that .
 We cannot be sure about British motivations in the talks, for which they took the initiative . We are not sure about the British motivations behind the talks .
 The talks may be the first step in a process to move us toward a relaxation of current pressures on Cuba . On the other hand, they may regard the talks as a first step to a move toward a relaxed approach .
 The British added that they would be interested in inviting the Canadians to participate . The British said they would like to invite the Canadians .
 British policy toward Cuba has been successful in isolating Cuba, it cannot overthrow the Castro regime or induce any changes in his basic policies . If the British have the latter intention, they may advocate the line, set forth in various ""think-piece"" despatches written by their Ambassador
 British may argue it is necessary to provide inducements to Castro in order to reduce or terminate his subversive activities and to lessen his dependence on the Soviet Union . Therefore, the British could argue it was necessary to give inducements .
 The inducements would be expanded economic and other relations with the non-OAS West . An end to ""subversive activities"" against Cuba, to be keyed to Castros cessation of activities against Latin America .
 There are indications that the British may have somewhat revised the assessments upon which the approach was based, and are now thinking in more modest terms, having in mind a more limited objective and the consequent employment of narrower inducements .
 We may find that they will stress the single goal of preventing Castro from, as they put it, being forced irreversibly into complete dependence upon the Soviets . The U.S. might find that this is the ultimate goal of stopping Castro from being forced to rely on the Soviets,
 The means by which this would be the expansion of trade and other relations between Cuba and the non-OAS West . Cuba would be able to expand trade relations with the West, the Cuban government says . The Cuban government has been criticized for its policies in the past .
 Our objectives, therefore, are to prevent the present Cuban Government from attaining its own objectives in Latin America . We want to bring about the retraction of Soviet power and influence in Latin American .
 U.S. says an opening to the West might give Castro more independence in dealings with the USSR . We see little or no reason to believe this would affect his bed-rock, continuing reliance on the Soviets for basic economic support and military guarantees .
 There is no evidence whatsoever that Castro has any intention of making an ideological shift, of moving out of the ""Socialist"" camp, or of being ready to abandon his objectives in Latin America .
 His strong desire for greater independence relates to his relationships within, not outside, the camp, he says . His desire to be independent relates to relationships within and outside the camp .
 We believe an arrangement like the one which the British may propose would be advantageous to Cuba and the USSR and distinctly disadvantageous to us . We believe that an arrangement such as that may be proposed by the British would be beneficial to both countries .
 We consider that such a policy would be less effective than our present low-cost, low-risk policy . It would keep Castro from moving toward his objective in the Hemisphere .
 In fact, the ""relaxed"" policy could well be destructive of any hopes of further progress toward our goals . In fact it could be destructive to our goals.
 Jack Vaughn chaired the meeting, which included John Crimmins and Bill Bowdler on the United States side . Rennie and Watson on the British side; and Pick on the Canadian side; .
 The purpose of the twoday talks was to assess the situation inside Cuba and to take a look at the policy options now available to the West .
 The first order of business was to assess the economic situation in Cuba . On this, there seemed to be general agreement, with the Cuban government . The first task was to look at the Cuban economy .
 Sugar crop this year will probably be about 5 million tons; it could be smaller if cane does not get cut in time . Sugar crop could be about five million tons .
 In this regard, external activist pressures on Cuba seem to make some difference on cane-cutting . If there were a relaxation, there would be fewer soldiers and more experts available to cut cane .
 Cuba's sugar production will probably reach 6. to 7. million tons by 1970 . Cuba's target of 10 million tons is to produce 6 to 7 million tons in 1970 .
 Russian combines are now being used and will undoubtedly be used more and more in the future . Russian combines have been used in the past and will be used in future .
 Sugar expansion in Cuba does seem to have some limiting factors, such as the difficulty of putting too many resources into this one industry, in view of other requirements . Sugar expansion seems to be a limiting factor in Cuba's industry .
 Cuba sells an average of 1. million tons of sugar to the Free World each year . Cubans have a dilemma in that they like to earn the convertible currency but don't like the price .
 Imports from the West will drop considerably in 1965 as opposed to 1964 because of Cubas foreign exchange problems . Cubas foreign currency problems will also drop significantly in 1965 .
 It is hard to say just how much subsidy the Soviets pay for Cuban sugar . While the announced price is considerably above the world market price, the sugar is part of a barter deal .
 Russian loans are probably not very hard and they probably dont expect to get repaid . With respect to aid, Russian loans may not be very hard, says Andrew Hammond .
 Russians get little good behavior for investment they are making, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "Amazing how little the Russians get, in the form of good behavior"
 The penalties for failure are excessive and lead to over-caution . There is entirely too much transferring of personnel, too much transfer of personnel and too much penalties . The penalty for failure is excessive .
 Fidel is not always happy about sending trainees to Russiae.g., learning to farm in a cold climate is not very applicable to farming in Cuba . Second, Fidel is always unhappy with sending students to Russia, not to be sent to Russia .
 Next to sugar, cattle production is the second most important economic activity . Arable crops dont seem to count for much in Argentina . Cattle production is a key economic activity in the country .
 Cuba seems to be at the bottom of the pendulum in terms of growth . Cuba is the fourth most populous country in the world, followed by Cuba in 2009 .
 Cuba's economy may swing back and make up the ground it has lost since 1961, but it is probably going to take a number of years before there is any real economic growth . Cuba is still struggling to make up its ground since 1961 . Cuba has been hit hard by a series of
 The group generally agreed with the set of conclusions attached at Tab 1. Political Currents in Cuban Leadership .
 Ambassador Watson did go on to elaborate at some length on the struggle between Castro and the Old Guard communists . Ambassador Watson went on to detail the struggle to oust Castro from Cuba .
 The removal of the Old Guard from points of power might not only be a reflection of Castro's dissatisfaction with this group . It is also possible that the Old Guards are getting more and more disenchanted with Cuban progress .
 Watson speculated that the Old Guard may do much to feed Moscows doubts about Russian involvement in Cuba . Watson: The Old Guard could feed Moscow’s doubts .
 At the outset, the British expressed strong reservations about the United States view regarding the threat of Cuban subversion in the Hemisphere .
 He is not so sure there will be revolution in Latin America in the near future and, in any event, he will not be the leader of it . He says he does not think he will be a leader of the revolution .
 The British believed Castro would reduce subversion if he got something meaningful in return . These beliefs, in addition to the belief that Castro may want to concentrate on his own island, lead the British to believe that he would reduce his subversion .
 Castro may feel that his efforts at rapprochement with the West have been rebuffed, the British say . The British speculate that any increase in subversive activity has to do with the fact that Castro may have felt rebuffed .
 The United States pointed out that, while it would be nonsense to attribute all Latin American tension to Cuba, it would not be inaccurate to say that Cuba had no responsibility for a considerable part of it . The U.S. says Cuba has responsibility for some of the tension in Latin America
 There was plenty of evidence around to indicate Cubas subversive interests . Certainly, there was evidence that Cubas subversive interest was there .
 There was a recent meeting in Havana among Latin American communists to revitalize the subversive effort . First, there was the recent meeting of Latin American communist leaders .
 There is in operation today a very energetic National Liberation Section in the Cuban Governments Directorate General of Intelligence. Second, there is in . operation today, there are in operation . Second, the Cuban government’s National Liberation . Section in . Cubas  Directorate
 In Colombia, the leader of a recent carefully planned subversive incident had spent two months in Cuba just before coming home to lead the insurgency . The leader of the recent incident in Colombia had been in Cuba for two months .
 Ambassador Vaughn noted that in Panama literally hundreds of people have received training over the past couple years . Ambassador Vaughn said that this number of people can make quite an impact on a fragile society .
 His personal experience with a few of these trainees indicates that they are Chinese-oriented, fanatical, and violent, he says . He says they are fanatical and violent .
 By the end of the discussion, the British seemed to have a somewhat better appreciation of the Cuban threat in Latin America . The British implied that a deal might be made with Castro on subversion .
 While there was a difference in emphasis between the United States and the British, by and large there was close agreement with the summary paragraphs attached at Tab 2 .
 There was a good deal of discussion on the question of how far the Soviets would be willing to disengage from Cuba .
 Even the British did not think that the Soviets would willingly permit Cuba to leave the Socialist camp, although they did imply that this could come about over the long pull once the West had its foot firmly in the door .
 First, the United States policy has been ""brilliant"" , and has provided us with a remarkable opportunity to loosen the Cuban/Soviet tie . First, U.S. policy in Cuba has been "Brilliant" and has been a "remarkable opportunity"
 This is an important opportunity since we do not want to make the Cuban/Soviet tie indissoluble . This is a good opportunity for the U.S.-Cuban relations with the Soviet Union, says President Obama .
 Non-OAS Free World countries should be encouraged to sound out the terms of Cuba's deal . The U.S. and the OAS should probably not ease their pressures on Cuba .
 One of the Western carrots might be an offer of increased contact with the non-OAS Free World . In exchange for good behavior on Castro's part, less subversion might be offered .
 We want to reduce subversion and induce a retraction of the USSR from the Hemisphere . We are engaged in a policy designed to strengthen the internal resistance of L.A. and Cuba, and demonstrate to the Soviets that they have made a mistake .
 Cuba’s failure to demonstrate progress has hurt the regime with its own people and hurt Cuba as an example in Latin America . Cubas economic prospects in Cuba are not bright, says Juan Castellanos .
 Cuba has been denied any subversive successes in Latin America . Second, Cuba has denied any successful successes in the region . Cuba is denied any success in Latin American .
 Fourth, it should be emphasized that this is a policy which has called for very modest risks and costs on the part of the West . The policy is called for modest risk and costs .
 A modest intensification of the present policy would improve results, he says . Moreover, one could argue that a modest intensity of the policy would also improve results .
 An intensification might increase Soviet/Cuban tensions and make Castro look like more of a satellite to Latin Americans . Among other things, an intensification may increase Soviet-Cuban tension .
 Relaxation may reduce the chances that we will ever hit the jackpot, may give Cuba political and economic respectability, and may demonstrate to Latin Americans that the Cuban path is worthwhile after all . On the other hand, relaxation may reduce chance of hitting jackpot .
 State is drafting up a joint record of conclusions which will be cleared by the British and Canadians /5/ and which primarily will spell out the options for the West, with the arguments pro and con . The West is being drawn up to discuss the West's options with the British .
 There are in being a number of British, U.S., and Canadian papers on such subjects as the Cuban economic situation, political currents in Cuba, and Cuban relations with Latin America .
 "So far as the United States is concerned, the meetings were quite useful," says President Obama . "We are very pleased with the results," says Obama .
 The meetings gave us an opportunity to educate the British and Canadians to our side of the story . We hope to persuade them that we are really not madmen when it comes to Cuba .
 The next step is to get together among ourselves and, taking into account the British views, give a good, hard, inter-departmental look at where we are headed and what we want to do about Cuba .
 This process is in the works now and will be picking up steam over the next few weeks . The process is expected to pick up steam in the coming weeks .
 He holds the rival elements together and is the arbiter of their differences . "He holds them together," he says of the president .
 There is no force in Cuba today in a position to challenge his authority, says the Cuban president . Cuba's government has been accused of corruption in the past .
 Castro turned to the Soviet Union in 1959 and 1960 more out of necessity than conviction, dictated by the internal and external programs he set for himself . Castro's relationship with the Soviets was more than a friendship than a love affair, he says .
 In the process of reorienting Cuba toward the Soviet Bloc he came to accept Marxism-Leninism . Cuba was reorientated toward the Bloc .
 "His strong emotional commitment to radical change predisposed him to this direction," he said . "He is committed to radical changes," he added .
 He is motivated, however, more by personal ambition than by ideological commitment . "He is motivated by ambition," he says .
 Cuban leader finds himself more dependent upon Moscow than is compatible with his plans and temperament . Having transformed Cuba into a Marxist-Leninist state and associated with the Bloc, he finds himself .
 Castro would like greater elbowroom within the ""Socialist" camp . There is no evidence to indicate that he desires to break away from the party . Castro is a member of the 'Socialist' camp .
 A Communist world organized along the lines of regional polycentrism in which Cuba would lead an independent Latin American group is more in line with his objectives . Cuba would be an independent group in a Communist world, he says .
 Of the various groups which comprise the Cuban political spectrum, neo-Communists are clearly dominant . Neo-Communist groups dominate Cuba's political spectrum .
 This is due to their numerical strength and positions they hold in the party-state apparatus, says Castro . Castro is himself a neo-Communist, Castro said . Castro's government has been accused of corruption in Cuba .
 No other group is in a position to challenge the neo-Communists as long as Castro takes their side . Castro takes his side in order to win the vote in Cuba .
 The old-guard Communists are passing through a critical period in which Castro appears intent on reducing their influence . Castro is intent on severely reducing, if not eliminating, their influence, he says .
 This is sufficient, however, to make Castro move cautiously against them . This is not enough to make him move cautiously, but it is sufficient to make a move cautiously .
 The neo-Communists appear to be on the ascendancy represents no advantage for the West . They are more fanatical, more emotionally ""anti-imperialist"", and more disposed to push armed struggle as the appropriate means .
 Status of Termination of Manuel Artimes Autonomous Paramilitary Group 1. 1.1.2.3.4.5.5 .
 CIA has begun phasing-out support to Artime . In accordance with the decision of the Committee on 4 March 1965, /2/ CIA has began phasing out support to the Artime.
 Artime has agreed to cooperate in the disbanding of his paramilitary group . Artime's paramilitary group will be disbanded by the end of the year .
 Admiral Raborn said he felt strongly that as a result of the Dominican situation and increasing subversion in the Hemisphere, we should make Castro’s life as difficult as possible at home .
 There were a number of things that could be done with existing capabilities and we should concentrate on hitting the source of the difficulty. ""b. "We should concentrate," he said. "We should be concentrating on hitting . source of difficulty"
 Bundy: "We had spent some months in searching for ways to hurt Castro without hurting ourselves more and had not found them" Bundy: We had spent months trying to find a way to hurt ourselves more .
 He remained skeptical as to whether any or even a combination of the various methods would permanently damage Castro without incurring high collateral political costs .
 Mr Vance said he had just discussed the methods enumerated in through /3/ with the Secretary of Defense . He said they had emerged negative on all higher noise-level operations at the present time .
 Ambassador Thompson indicated State was opposed, if for somewhat different reasons . Ambassador Thompson said State was also opposed, though it was not .
 Continual harassment by the United States might stimulate Soviet aid . If left alone, the Soviets might tire of the rising costs of Cuban disarray and ineptitude . The U.S. might leave Cuba alone .
 If Cubans on the island realized that the U.S. was faint-hearted, they would continue their coalescence into the Castro body politic . If the Cubans realize that the United States was faint heartless, they could coalesce into Castro's body politic.
 The limited activities consisting of infiltration/exfiltration operations, intelligence collection, and economic measures appeared to be all the Committee members were prepared to endorse at this time . ""e.e.
 I think you should know that Admiral Raborn has recommended reactivation of a paramilitary effort against Cuba . I think it should be reactivated to reactivate the paramilitary effort .
 Night attacks on major Cuban merchant vessels were while in Cuban territorial waters . Night attacks were carried out in Cuban waters .
 Deception operations designed to give the impression of imminent invasion by U.S. forces . Deception operation designed to . give . impression of . imminent invasion of United States forces. Deception . operations .
 The trouble most of us see in such operations is that their international noise level outweighs their anti-Castro value . The trouble we see is that such operations have an international noise factor .
 Most of us do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba . Especially with the Dominican problem before us, most of us don't recommend visible violence .
 Printed from a copy that bears these typed initials . B /3/ Look at it again. B /4/ Leave it alone for now. B .
 In June 1963 President Kennedy approved a covert policy and an integrated program of action toward Cuba .
 Only five hit-and-run operations had been carried out in the period August-December 1963 . Course 5 was suspended in January 1964 after only five operations were completed .
 In terms of purely Cuban policy, the raids probably had had a net positive effect . The raids were likely to have had a positive effect on the island nation .
 The decision to suspend was taken essentially on broader grounds, including concern about disturbing the emerging détente between the United States and the Soviets . The desire to avoid measures which might prevent or delay Soviet troop withdrawals from Cuba, the desire to have ""clean hands" in moving towards OAS
 A tactical factor was the embarrassment caused us by the Cuban capture of a CIA infiltration team in December 1963 and the subsequent revelations by members of the team . The team was captured by the CIA in Cuba, Cuba, and the CIA captured by Cuba .
 It is important to note that this incident occurred in connection with an infiltration and that this kind of operation continues to be approved . The incident was part of an operation that was approved by the government, officials said .
 Operations by ""autonomous" groups were permitted to proceed in 1964 . The first effort occurred in April 1964 . Operations by 'autonomous' groups were allowed to proceed .
 In late 1964-early 1965, however, these too were closed out because they were producing more problems and risks than results . U.S.-USSR relations and in the Vietnamese situation were also closed out in 1965 .
 An important special factor during most of the life of the operations was the concern that they would provoke Cuban action against U.S. surveillance overflights . The autonomous operations were conducted in Cuba .
 No paramilitary efforts are being mounted against Cuba at present . Thus, there are no paramilitary efforts being mounted . No paramilitary forces are currently being mounted in Cuba .
 The CIA proposal is, in effect, an attempt to seek a reversal of the early 1964 decision with respect to their own operations . The proposal is in effect .
 The basis of the CIA proposal is the belief that the present state of the Cuban question counsels a resumption of CIA-controlled paramilitary activity, the CIA says . The proposal is based on a belief that there will be paramilitary activity .
 Castro regime is almost certainly more firmly entrenched now than at any time since its accession to power . Current Situation: Castro regime now more entrenched than ever before . Castro regime has been in power for more than a decade .
 The economy, although still operating at a relatively low level, has been moving forward in the past two years . The economy is hampered by disorganization and inefficiency, but it is moving forward .
 The prospect is that modest advances will continue through 1965, with the outlook highly uncertain beyond this year . The prospect of modest advances in technology is uncertain beyond 1965 .
 Politically, the regime certainly has problems, but it appears capable of dealing with them, short of the disappearance of Castro . The regime appears to be able to deal with them short of Castro's disappearance, CNN says .
 Security measures have become increasingly effective, but there are, from time to time, evidences of uneasiness and over-reaction to internal or external threats, real or imagined, on the part of the regime . Security measures are increasingly effective but there is still an overreaction
 The average Cuban is probably unhappy with his lot and skeptical of significant, early improvement of it . But he is almost certainly becoming more and more resigned to the permanence of the regime .
 Internal active opposition to the government has grown weaker in recent years . Anti-government opposition has grown increasingly weaker in Syria .
 Morale among antiregime elements within and outside Cuba is low, and there is growing reluctance among these groups to take the risks involved in acts of resistance . Morale within and out of Cuba among anti-Cuba elements is low .
 This prudence is heightened by the absence of visible, effective external pressures . The absence of external pressures has led to a greater prudence in the country .
 The pressures, largely economic, which we have placed upon the regime have probably had moderate success in delayingbut not in preventingthe movement toward internal consolidation of the Castro government, the authors say .
 If maintained at their present level, they will probably become more and more difficult to maintain and less effective . They will probably be less effective if maintained at the present level . If maintained, they may become more difficult and less efficient .
 Author: Pressure has not induced the regime to abandon its subversive efforts in Latin America . Author: The regime has not abandoned its efforts to engage in Latin American subversion .
 Cuba has been trying to make its efforts more effective at a time when our own subversive measures against it have been sharply reduced . The great bulk of the evidence shows that Cuba .
 There are, moreover, several indications of increased Soviet activity in fostering ""national liberation movements"" in Latin America . There are also indications that there is also increased activity in the region .
 It is not possible to say whether this apparent Soviet decision to become more heavily involved in Latin America arises from the need to meet Chinese Communist pressures, or from an assessment that the general situation in the Hemisphere affords more opportunities than before .
 Evidence of heightened Soviet activity in Latin America is relevant to any consideration of the effects on US-USSR relations of U.S. policies toward Cuba and toward subversion .
 The situation in Latin America from the U.S. point of view remains fragile, and subversion remains a constant concern . Subversion, whether from Havana, Moscow or Peking acting independently or together, is still a concern .
 Cuba's image of Latin America in Latin America has been dimmed since 1961, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Cuba has a relatively low-key U.S. policy toward Cuba in the past two years, Sutter says .
 A Communist Cuba which will be able to show that it is progressing economically and is consolidated politically cannot help but be impressive in Latin America . Nevertheless, a Communist Cuba cannot help to be impressive .
 When such a regime is able, at the same time, continues to carry out acts of subversion with impunity, the U.S. is magnified in Latin America . The negative effects for the United States are magnified by the actions of the Soviet-controlled regime .
 The weakening or even the disappearance of the Communist government in Cuba would certainly not solve United States problems in Latin America, but its continuation and its gradual entrenchment seriously prejudice U.S. objectives and programs, says President Obama .
 The United States actions in the Dominican Republic have probably had mixed effects on Latin American views on U.S. policy toward Cuba . The actions probably have had mixed effect on Latin America's views on Cuba .
 Latin American elements in Latin America which have advocated a ""hard"" United States line on Cuba and Communist subversion were probably encouraged by the U.S. intervention . Some hoped that it foreshadowed a ""tougher"" attitude .
 Most of the sectors which opposed or were made uneasy by the United States action in the Dominican Republic as a retrograde step in US-Latin American relations would probably tend to fear that a more aggressive U.S. stance toward Cuba was part of a general administration policy of ""cracking
 Cuban regime has made some gains in at least the short term in left sectors of the Hemisphere . Cuban regime hasn't been able to restore its image in Latin America as a result of the Dominican affair .
 Within the United States, interest in the Cuban problem is at a very low ebb . Interest in the U.S. has been low in recent years . The Cuban crisis has been a major problem for the United Kingdom .
 The administration is not under significant domestic pressure to ""do something""beyond what it is now doing . The administration does not need to "do something" beyond what it's now doing, the president says .
 The Cuban government seems to believe that matters are going reasonably well for us in Cuba, CNN's John Sutter writes .
 If this belief begins to wane, if events elsewhere in Latin America go against our interests, it could change, especially in 1966 . If such setbacks could be attributed to Cuban activities, this could change policy .
 An influential general factor here would be the results of our Vietnamese policy, says the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam .
 Paramilitary activities have a considerably better chance of creating within Cuba the political, economic and psychological effects we have sought, the U.S. says . Paramilitary activity is better than intensification of overt economic denial measures .
 They provide an unmistakable signal to all concerned of our continuing opposition to the Cuban regime, the U.S. says .
 They can be justified, if necessary, in appropriate quarters as a response to the harder Cuban-Soviet line in Latin America, particularly in view of the long stand-down which can be presented as an unsuccessful attempt .
 They may exacerbate Cuban-USSR relations, should Soviet response to Cuban requests for support be considered inadequate by Havana .
 The risk of capture of participants is not appreciably greater than that involving infiltration/exfiltration teams, whose operations remain authorized . Risk of capture is greater than those of infiltration teams, which are authorized, officials say .
 U.S. involvement in the activities is to some degree deniable because of the personnel and techniques involved . United States involvement in these activities is deniable . The United States is involved in some of the activities .
 The activities take advantage of an existing capability, which over time is degraded through disuse . The activities use the existing capability .
 It is impossible to predict with any assurance whether paramilitary activities will in fact bring about the results hoped for within Cuba . The Cuban government has been accused of using paramilitary activities in Cuba .
 The regime may be able to utilize the activities as a means of rallying political support against ""imperialist aggression" and as an excuse to the Cuban people, the Soviets, and others for its failures .
 The erosion of the will to resist and the improvement of the security apparatus may have progressed beyond the point of no return . Moreover, the eroding of thewill to resist may have been beyond the limit, says the author .
 There is no serious possibility of cloaking U.S. involvement, whether or not missions go awry and personnel are captured . The United States will not be able to cloaking its involvement in the Iraq mission .
 "If we decide it is necessary to suspend the activities in midcourse, the effects will probably be sharply negative and perhaps irreparable," he says . "The effects of the suspension of the activities will be sharp negative," he adds .
 The resumption of paramilitary activities will probably stimulate uncontrolled exile groups to attempt to launch raids from U.S. territory, the U.N. says .
 Such activities may strengthen rather than weaken SovietCuban ties, particularly in the context of the Soviet-Chinese Communist conflict . Such activities are seen as strengthening rather than weakening Soviet Cuba ties .
 Subversive efforts in Latin America may be intensified in retaliation, and our own ""dirty hands"" may reduce our ability to obtain Latin American and other support for counter-action . Subversive . efforts in . Latin American . and other . support for Counter-action may reduce . our ability
 Paramilitary activities increase the risk of Cuban action against surveillance overflights, Cuban officials say . Paramilitary activity increases risk of Cuba taking action against overflights . The Cuban government has been criticized by the U.S. government for its actions .
 Some sectors in Latin America fear that the administration is embarking on a course of direct action throughout the Hemisphere . They will probably reinforce fears in some sectors in the region .
 Under present levels of external pressure, the Cuban regime probably will become stronger and better entrenched . The Cuban regime is likely to become stronger, better entrenched, says CNN's John Defterios .
 The regime remains committed to the ""export of revolution"" and, in concert with the USSR, is attempting to make Communist subversive activities in Latin America more effective . The regime is committed to making subversive activities more effective in Latin American .
 The stronger the regime becomes, the greater are the difficulties and dangers for U.S. policy in Latin America . The stronger regime is the greater risk to the United States, writes CNN's John Sutter .
 The regime still confronts economic and political difficulties which constitute vulnerabilities and which indicate that we have not yet run out of time . In spite of the improvement in its position, the regime still faces economic, political difficulties .
 Increased pressure, either in the form of additional overt economic measures or of a resumption of paramilitary activities, offers some unmeasurable prospect of halting and reversing the trend in Cuba .
 Of the two types of pressure, paramilitary activities provide a better chance of success . paramilitary activities are more likely to succeed than other pressure pressure, says CNN.com .
 paramilitary activities, after a relatively brief trial, have been considered to be too costly politically in relation to their return and to the availability of other means of pressure believed at the time to be promising . In the past paramilitary activities have been seen to be considered too costly .
 paramilitary activities have to be carried on steadily and progressively over a considerable period of time . In order to avoid the perhaps irreparable damage of suspension in mid-course, paramilitary activities must be carried out slowly and progressively .
 A decision to embark upon paramilitary activities carries with it an acceptance of their objective, a coup from within the power structure, the author says . The timing and nature of the timing of the paramilitary activities we might well not control, he says .
 We can continue our present policy in full awareness that, barring some fortuitous development, we will probably lose ground in terms of both our Cuban and Latin American objectives, says the British Foreign Secretary .
 The U.S. can increase pressure on Cuba by resuming paramilitary activities or taking additional economic measures, the president says . "We can arrest and eventually reverse the forward movement of the Cuban regime," he says .
 U.S. can try to bring about a Titoist evolution of the Cuban regime, accepting in the process the probability of serious damage to our long-term interests in Latin America .
 Of these options, a policy of increased pressure on Cuba provides the best protection for our position in Latin America, says President Obama . Of all options, increased pressure is the best, he says .
 The resumption of paramilitary activities against Cuba meets the needs of our Cuban and Latin American policies . Because it has a better chance of being successful than other available means of increasing pressure, it has been successful .
 The resumption of these activities will certainly have positive and negative effects on the achievement of national objectives in areas of foreign policy beyond Latin America . The net result of these effects must obviously be assessed, and must be assessed .
 ARA recommends that, provided that the benefits to our Cuban and Latin American policies are not clearly outweighed by disadvantages elsewhere, 1.1.2.3.4.5. Recommendations ARA says .
 If you decide that the broad national interest would not be served by resumption, /2/ you authorize in principle the initiation of additional measures of economic denial, it being understood of course that these measures would be subject to your approval . If you choose to continue the process, you authorize
 He took exception to the view that paramilitary operations were merely a "pinprick" He believed that none of these efforts had been really carried through .
 He also noted that Cubans ""over-react"" to these operations and therefore the disruptive effect was greater . He also said Cubans over-react to the operations .
 Hart assured Vaughn renewed operations could be undertaken without ""undue publicity"" and fully under CIA control . Hart said the renewed operations would be fully under agency control .
 To estimate the Cuban situation and outlook over the next year or two. The Cuban situation will be looked at in the next few years . To estimate how Cuba will react to the next two years.
 Castro’s hold on power is firm; there is virtually no chance of his overthrow in the foreseeable future . Castros hold is firm, but he is unlikely to be overthrown in the near future .
 His regime has abandoned its ill conceived program for rapid industrialization and is now concentrating on what Cuba can produce most readily . Cuba's sugar production is the key to Cuba's success .
 The economy is making some progress, though not enough to advance living conditions much during the next few years . The economy will continue to make progress, but it won't advance living standards much in the coming years .
 Castro has cooled toward the Chinese Communists . Recognizing that he has no alternative to further large-scale aid from the Soviet Union, Castro has moved politically closer to the Soviets .
 He no longer views all Latin America as on the brink of revolution, and will concentrate his clandestine support where revolutionaries are already active . Venezuela, Guatemala, Colombia, Colombia and Peru will be the focus of support, he says .
 Both the Soviets and the Cubans will probably exercise caution to avoid any direct confrontation with the United States in Latin America . Castro is not likely to use his SAMs to shoot down a U.S. U2 .
 I am informed that you would like to have my views for presentation to the President on the CIA proposal to reactivate its paramilitary efforts against Cuba . I'm told that you want to have your views on the proposal to present your views to the president .
 CIA chief: "I am strongly opposed to resumption of such operations at this time" CIA director: "It would be advisable for the CIA to keep open, so far as may be practicable"
 I believe that with the current situation in the Dominican Republic and the status of the conflict in Viet-Nam, not to mention other problems around the world, we should not initiate the actions proposed .
 "The proposed program could well affect Soviet policies in a manner adverse to our interests," he said . The proposed program was described as 'a matter of concern'
 I should be glad to reconsider the matter should changes in circumstances so warrant. I should also reconsider the decision, he says . I should consider reconsidering the matter .
 A study of this question was prepared by the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs of the Department, /2/ which constitutes a useful statement of the problem from the point of view of our interests in the Western Hemisphere, but, as will be noted above, I do not reach the same
 Castro is supporting and encouraging active or potential insurgent groups in 14 Latin American nations as well as several in Africa . Castro is also supporting or encouraging groups in several Latin American countries . Castro: "I'm not afraid to say yes"
 Cuba is a privileged sanctuary within the Western hemisphere from which Communist subversive efforts are launched . Cuba is also a sanctuary for the Cuban people, says the Cuban president .
 Castro defiance of the U.S. strengthens ultra-nationalist and proCommunist movements in the hemisphere . Castro defiance will strengthen pro-communist and anti-American movements in hemisphere .
 Reactivation of selective paramilitary harassment at this time is our best means to cost him heavily in money and manpower at a highly critical time and reduce his capability to export revolution .
 CIA has in being a small paramilitary mechanism composed of Cubans . CIA can mount carefully selected operations which can destroy installations and facilities with loss of life held to a minimum while economic damage is maximized . CIA has been a very small paramilitary force in Cuba .
 The Department of State examined this proposal, the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs supported the CIA reasoning . The Bureau also examined the proposal, and the CIA supported it, the State Department said .
 Reactivation of these operations would provide an unmistakable signal to all concerned of our continuing opposition to Castro, the U.S. State Department says .
 The stronger the regime becomes, the greater the difficulties and danger for U.S. policy in Latin America, says Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: "The stronger regime becomes ... the greater ... danger for United States policy"
 Of these options, the policy of increased pressure provides the best protection of our position in Latin America, says President Vladimir Putin .
 On 30 August, the Secretary of State made known his views in the attached memorandum .
 On 20 September, Deputy Secretary of Defense Vance confirmed that he and Mr McNamara hold the same opinion as Mr Rusk .
 Fidel Castro stated that Cubans desiring to go to the U.S. would be permitted to do so . Exiles wishing to come and pick up their relatives at the Port of Camarioca would be free to . do so after October 10 . Fidel Castro declared that exiles
 There followed a chaotic rush of small boats from Florida to Camarioca . Small boats were seen in the chaos as they made their way from Florida .
 Bundy: "Castro seems to have misread, deliberately or otherwise, your Statue of Liberty statement, interpreting it to mean that we wanted to conduct all negotiations through the Red Cross" Bundy said in an October 6 memorandum to the President, Bundy stated that . Bundy said that Castro seems
 We have pointed out to him through the Swiss that this is not the case. We have also pointed out that he is not in Switzerland .
 The first refugees with family members in the United States began arriving in Florida by small boat in October . The first of the refugees arrived in October by boat in small boat .
 Bundy: 'We took special measures to persuade Cubans in southern Florida to wait until orderly arrangements could be worked out' Bundy: "We took ... special measures" to persuade Cuban citizens to wait .
 Bundy noted that the previous night ""the Cubans had replied to our note outlining procedures for handling the flow of refugees" Bundy said that the Cuban government had responded to the request . Bundy noted the previous day that the Cubans responded to a note outlining their procedures for dealing with the refugees
 "We had expressed a desire to keep the flow to about 3,000 per month, but they said they preferred a 12,000 rate" "They said they wanted to keep it down to 3,500 per month," the mayor says .
 Men of military age would not be allowed out, but agreed to prioritise immediate family members . They said that men of service age would be not allowed out .
 They want to make up the lists of persons to depart, but they explicitly recognized our right to veto persons on the lists . The UK has vetoes on some of the lists, but the UK has a veto power to veto them .
 The Cuban Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the Swiss Embassy in Havana on October 19 . Bowdler, Bundy and Bundy were involved in the Cuban government's anti-gay policy .
 The United States continued to insist that the Camarioca boat traffic had to be reduced, controlled, and eventually eliminated . The U.S. government insisted that the boat traffic must be reduced .
 The Cuban Ministry of Interior announced that as of midnight that day that day, no more boats would be allowed to dock at Camarioca to pick up relatives . On October 28, the Cuban government announced that the closure .
 Cuban citizens were allowed to leave Camarioca on November 4 . The agreement on the agreement became imminent . The Cuban government announced that as of noon that day it would permit no further departure .
 The sealift was completed on November 24 when the last eligible Camarioca refugees were brought to the U.S. The last eligible refugees have now been brought into the United States .
 The shift from sealift to airlift took place as scheduled on December 1 . The shift was scheduled to take place as planned .
 Airlift operated on the basis of two flights per day, 5 days a week, carrying an average of 4,000 persons each month from Varadero to Miami, Florida .
 3,349 came in December via the airlift arranged by the U.S. and Cuban Governments . Of these, 3,350 came in . of these in December . The United States and Cuban governments have been involved in airlifting .
 The airlift continued until April 1973, by which time a total of 260,737 refugees had entered the U.S. The airlifts continued until the end of the airlift .
 The airlift provided a major new transportation link, since after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 all direct commercial air transportation between the U.S. and Cuba had been suspended . Some people could arrange transportation through Mexico or Spain, although some people could .
 By December 1968, there were still thousands on this list awaiting departure . Thousands were still awaiting departure from the U.S.
 In the past four days there have been two reported incidents of Cuban penetration of the Guantanamo Base perimeter .
 A Marine sentry at about 7:00m. observed an armed Cuban soldier on the Base side of the fence . Night of May 2122
 The sentry reports that he challenged him and fired a warning shot which the intruder ignored . The intruder ignored the warning shot, the sentry says .
 It is not clear whether the Cuban was on the Base side of the fence when this shot was fired . It is unclear if the shooter was in the area at the time .
 The Cuban soldier involved in the incident was probably the one which the Cuban Government alleges was killed by the Marines while at his post on the Cuban side of the fence . The Cuban government alleges that the soldier was killed while on his post .
 At about midnight a Marine patrol sighted six armed Cuban soldiers in the salt flats area inside the Base perimeter . The incident occurred at about midnight .
 The Cubans reportedly fired four rounds at the Marines and fled over the fence . The Marines were attacked by the Cubans, who then fled the fence over the border .
 At present there is no indication that these incidents are in any way related to the Cuban suspension of refugee flights last Friday . The Cuban government has suspended refugee flights .
 Administrative delays in shifting from Category ""A"" refugees to Category ""B"" is not a sufficient explanation . It is not the only explanation for the delay in moving refugees from Category "A" to Category "B"
 Since the airlift started last December 1, almost 22,000 Cuban refugees in the ""A"" Category have arrived . The airlift began on December 1 .
 The Cuban Government claims that there are no more persons in this particular group who wish to come . The Cuban government claims that no more people will be allowed to come to Cuba .
 We told the Cubans last week that we are prepared to start with Category ""B"" refugees, so that the record is clear that any delayor suspensionis not our doing .
 There are several as yet inconclusive indicators that the Cubans would like to close down the airlift if they could find a means to shift the onus on us .
 Covert collection of counterintelligence and the use of this information to counter Cuban efforts to export the revolution . c. c. Counterintelligence was used to counter efforts to counter Cuba's export of the Cuban revolution . Covert intelligence was used as a tool to counter the Cuban government's efforts
 Intelligence and covert action operations are designed to detect discontent, and the latter to exploit discontent, within the military and other key power centers . d. d. The former was designed to target and exploit discontent within the U.S.
 Covert actions, including propaganda, designed to stimulate discontent, to maintain the spirit of resistance, at least to some degree, and maintain the isolation of Cuba . Covert action is designed to provoke discontent and to maintain Cuba's isolation of the country .
 The February 1966 memo was a CIA effort to contain the Castro regime rather than undermine it . It should be noted that, in contrast with earlier CIA programs, the objective of the program was not to undermine the regime . The memo was published in 1966 .
 Increase emphasis on the collection of intelligence and counterintelligence through operations in third countries . Increase emphasis to the collection .
 The Cuban security services have improved in Cuba's security services . This has resulted in increasing difficulty in creating and maintaining in-place assets in Cuba . This is necessary because of the quantitative and qualitative improvement in the security services, the government says .
 The decline in the productivity of agents recruited by means of infiltration operations exemplifies this problem . b. b. The decline is due to the fact that agents are less productive than they are recruited in the United States .
 Because of the decreasing effectiveness of intelligence infiltration operations it is planned to limit these to those essential to exfiltrate agents who are in difficulties in Cuba, to provide support to inside assets, and to infiltrate teams for intelligence purposes only on limited occasions in order to gain access to high priority
 To revise the total output of written and radio propaganda directed at Cuba, to retain those portions of the current program which are currently effective, and eliminating those portions which have become outdated .
 The revision of the program will involve an overall quantitative reduction, but is not expected to affect the impact within Cuba appreciably . The revision is expected to involve a quantitative reduction .
 The proposal envisages elimination or reduction of support to certain specialized exile groups, such as jurists, students, and teachers . The proposal would eliminate or reduce the support of certain specialized exiled groups .
 Also under consideration is the possibility of substituting use of commercial radio stations located in the United States for the present radio broadcast facility maintained . d. d. also under consideration .
 They will result in significant savings in money and manpower, however . They will be significant savings, however, according to the government .
 Gordon noted that the CIA intended to cut down its 24-hour-a-day propaganda broadcasts to Cuba to 46 hours of comparatively high-quality material . Gordon: The CIA planned to cut back on the broadcasts to a less than four hours of high quality material .
 Agency intended to maintain ""on an active basis six highly trained and expert infiltration teams on which it can rely for intelligence collection purposes."" nations .
 It is believed that such an interpretation can be effectively thwarted in part by more sophisticated radio programming and by one or more authoritative restatements of policy .
 Minutes: CIA estimates savings of approximately $2,000,000 . CIA says the finely honed program would result in savings of about $2 million . Minutes: Committee approved paper as presented, CIA says .
 To estimate the outlook over the next two years. The problem to estimate is that the outlook is that of the future . Key issues and prospects for the country's economy are key to success .
 The Castro revolution has survived adversity, but it has not prospered . Castro revolution survived adversity but has failed to thrive, says Castro . Castro's revolution has not survived adversity .
 The regime is keying its hopes for major material progress to the more distant future . It expects the economic impact of its large-scale education and long-term economic programs to be felt .
 The level of the economy in 1966 was only slightly above that reached in 1958, the last prerevolutionary year . Per capita private consumption was down nearly 25 percent, though favored groups were better off .
 Economic gains in 1967 and 1968 will probably be minor, with little or no improvement in living conditions . Economic gains probably will probably not be minor .
 The United States Intelligence Board concurred in this estimate on March 2 . The U.S. intelligence board concurred with this estimate .
 Fidel will almost certainly persist in providing encouragement and training support to ""anti-imperialist" and insurgent movements abroad, and in extending material aid .
 Poor prospects for success in Latin America help account for his increased support to revolutionary elements in Africa . There are more opportunities and fewer risks in Africa than Latin America, he says .
 Differences about Communist revolutionary tactics and the amount of aid required by Cuba will continue to produce frictions in the Cuban-Soviet relationship . Differences about . Communist revolutionary . tactics and . the amount . of aid needed by Cuba .
 Cuba remains important to the Soviets; they have little practical choice except to keep backing Fidel Castro . Cuba is important to Cuba; it is important for the Soviet Union to remain loyal to the Cuban government .
 Castro has continued the process of institutionalizing his revolution . Castro has talked of sharing more responsibility with his inner circle of colleagues . Castro is expected to take on more responsibility .
 We believe that he will remain clearly pre-eminent, however, and his hold on power will remain strong . We also believe he will be a strong leader .
 In the unlikely event of Fidels death or incapacitation during the next two years, a collegium headed by his brother Raúl and President Dorticós would probably take control of the country .
 We doubt that this arrangement could long endure; it would probably give way to a power struggle of unpredictable outcome . We doubt it could be long-lasting; some point it would give way way to power struggle .
 We know of no basis for supposing that a resulting new government would fundamentally change the domestic political and economic system . However, there are no grounds to suppose that such a government would change the country's political system .
 Report of Soviet Strategic Missiles in Cuba . I have checked the charges made by Paul Bethel before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee today that there are Soviet strategic missiles .
 We think it highly unlikely that the USSR will attempt to reintroduce strategic missiles into Cuba . The USSR will not attempt to re-establish strategic missiles in Cuba, experts say .
 The build-up of strategic forces in the USSR in recent years would make the installation of strategic weapons in Cuba of less significance to the Soviet strategic posture than in 1962 .
 Paul Bethel is a propagandist who for the past five years has traded on his brief experience in our Embassy in Havana to make a living out of the Cuban issue . Bethel: "You should know that . You should know ... that Paul Betchel is a . propagand
 "What he told the Subcommittee today is the same tale which he has repeatedly published in his newsletter and tells everybody who is willing to listen to him," says Rep. Tom Coburn . Coburn: "He has repeatedly told everybody who has been listening to him"
 The sources for his charges are the same Cuban refugees who passed through our intelligence screening process in Miami, Florida . The Cuban refugees have passed through the same screening process as Cuban refugees .
 I'm having State do an assessment of other charges made in his testimony . I am having State to assess the other charges, he said .
 At Punta del Este Valdez Valdez /2/ spoke to me about Cuba and seemed to think that there are now some differences of view in Havana which might be open to probing . Valdez/2/ said that some differences in Havana may open to probe .
 President Kennedy said Cuba could find its way back to the Hemisphere if it stopped its interference in the affairs of other American states by agents, arms and propaganda, and severed its military association with the Soviet Union . The attitude of the U.S. remains that indicated by President Kennedy, namely
 Cuba's internal organization is not the crucial obstacle, says Castro . "Internal organization of Cuba is not a crucial obstacle," he says . "These two primary external forces were fundamental," he adds .
 Valdez: Castro has seen no real evidence that he is prepared to change his attitude on either point . Valdez added that Castro is not willing to give up his stance on the issue of Castro .
 Putin seems to be differing with Moscow on the question of interference in other countries . He seems to differ with the Russian leader on the issue of interference .
 I told Valdez I saw no objection to any most secret probes which he might wish to undertake . Valdez: 'If he got anything of interest coming back we would be glad to know about it' Valdez said .
 I further said that we would set up this special channel between you and me in order to assure maximum secrecy and that he could be entirely frank in passing on to you, and to you alone, anything that develops . I said he could pass on anything he wants to do to you and
 A review of our Cuba policy seems very much needed, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: Review of the Cuba policy is needed .
 Our present policy of economic denial and political isolation through OAS action has contributed to Castro�s difficulties, but has not shaken his grip on power . Castros difficulties have contributed to his difficulties, says Castro .
 In any event, after six years it is only prudent to ask whether this policy will be the best means of advancing our national interests under the conditions which may prevail .
 A policy review might well conclude that, all things considered, no fundamental change is required . A policy change is not required, but a policy review may be necessary .
 The manner and consequences of applying considerably increased pressure on the Castro regime could both be studied . The opportunities and risks involved in seeking some accommodation could also be studied. For example, the risks and opportunities to seek accommodation could be explored .
 "Without a thorough evaluation, however, we do not have the basis for recommending any of these courses of action on Cuba," says CNN.com .
 President Johnson directed Helms to conduct an investigation after reading a March 7, 1967, column by Drew Pearson that alleged the U.S. attempted to assassinate Castro . Helms' investigation was launched after Pearson's column .
 The Inspector General’s Report of April 24, 1967, indicated that the CIA was in contact with and cooperated with Major Rolando Cubela of the Cuban military in plans to assassinate Fidel Castro . The report was the result of the Inspector Generals Report .
 After receiving the report, Helms orally briefed the President about its contents .
 Helms said he didn't know if he had told the President that efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro had continued into Johnson’s presidency . Helms: ‘I just can’t answer that, I just dont know.’
 The records of the Special Group for the Johnson administration do not record any consideration, authorization, or involvement by the U.S. in any plot to assassinate Castro . The CIA had a relationship with Cubela .
 Others felt that the United States was being put on notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then undertake prevention . Others, including Mr Bundy, said the U.S. should do more to prevent the spread of terrorism .
 McCone sent Bundy an August 19 memorandum reviewing the investigation and agreeing with the FBI analysis . McCone agreed with an FBI analysis that dismissed the reported exile assassination plans . Bundy agreed with the analysis .
 The CIA Inspector General’s Report of April 24, 1967, provides considerable information about Project AMLASH during the Johnson administration . The report was published in 1967 .
 The Report indicates that a CIA officer was passing an assassination weapon, a ballpoint pen rigged with a hypodermic needle, to Rolando Cubela, AMLASH1 .
 Rolando Cubela Secades was the second-ranking leader of the Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo, an elite group of leftist students . The group was founded in 1956 to organize violence to overthrow the Batista regime .
 Cubela was non-committal when the CIA first contacted him in March of 1961 in Mexico City . He soon began to insist that the essential first step in overthrowing the Cuban regime was the elimination of Castro himself . Cubela stated he was prepared to accomplish .
 Cubela attempted to obtain a silencer for a Belgian FAL submachine gun, but the CIA was unable to produce one in time to be included in an arms cache drop . After the aborted ballpoint poison pen incident, Cubela was able to obtain one .
 The CIA put Cuban exile leader Manuel Artime and Cubela together in such a way that neither knew that the contact had been engineered by the Agency . Neither knew that Artime or Cubela had been put in contact .
 Artime and Cubela met in Madrid on December 27 and December 30, 1964, where Artime agreed to provide a silencer to Cubela . Artime gave Cubela the silencer .
 Cubela met Artime in Madrid on February 1012, 1965, and reportedly received a Belgian FAL rifle with silencer . Cubela reportedly received two pistols with silencers .
 Cubela requested financial assistance from several CIA officers for emergency travel expenses . Cubela was given a total of $8,200 by the CIA .
 Cubela group members were killed in 1965 . Cubela was part of the Cubela network of Cubela fighters .
 Cubela was arrested by Cuban security police in March 1966, confessed his guilt, and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment . Castro's request to the prosecutor that the death penalty not be imposed was denied .
 "Continuing concerns of this Bureau has been with the implementation of the Departments controls on the travel of U.S. citizens to Cuba," she said . "As I am certain you know, one of the continuing concerns of the Bureau is with Cuba," the secretary of
 The Under Secretary spoke to me a short time ago on the general subject of travel controls . He said the Under Secretary of State spoke to him on the matter of travel .
 With this in mind, I thought it might be appropriate to outline to you our problems and views on this subject . We are happy to clarify that we are not going to live in a state of war .
 Restrictions exist on travel of American citizens to North VietNam, North Korea and Communist China . Restrictions also exist on the travel of Americans to Communist China and Cuba .
 Under the current implementing rules, /3/ exceptions to these restrictions relate to such categories as professional journalists, medical and public health specialists, and graduate scholars needing to do research in Cuba .
 Other casesincluding those involving humanitarian factorsare considered on a discretionary basis .
 Journalists and scholars, of course, constitute the bulk of applications for waivers to our travel restrictions . Journalists, scholars, are among the most likely to be granted waivers .
 SCA’s position is that journalists, for example, constitute a mandatory exception, but it is supposed to be necessary for applicants to show that they are established journalists who earn the greater part of their living through this profession .
 Until recently, if that office interposed strong objections to an application, SCA either accepted these objections or deferred a final decision on the validation of the applicants passport until CCA had had an opportunity to present its views in detail .
 The celebration of Cubas National Day on July 26 this year and the LASO conference which began on July 31 resulted in a flood of applications for journalist travel to Cuba .
 Our present concern arose when it became clear that ARA’s role was being eroded to the point where, in a number of the most doubtful cases, passports were validated despite the fact that CCA had raised strong objections, in some cases without informing CCA .
 As a general rule, I personally believe that ""the truth will out"" and that any increase in the flow of information or opinions eventually will work to our advantage .
 The way in which we carry out the various aspects of our policy toward Cuba directly affects our relations with other Latin American countries . However, I hardly need to point out that . I hardly . need point out . that, I . hardly need point . out .
 The application of our own restrictions on travel to Cuba is no exception to this rule . Cuba is the only country in the world to be allowed to travel to the island nation of Cuba .
 It is part of our basic policy, and that of the OAS, to isolate Cuba, to cut down the movement of subversives, says President Obama . Cuba is isolated for political, economic and psychological reasons, says Obama .
 This policy was reiterated strongly by the OAS Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Washington September 2224, 1967 . OAS foreign ministers met in Washington to discuss the policy .
 In connection with the recent LASO conferences, we made strenuous efforts to encourage Latin American governments to inhibit travel to that meeting . In the past, Latin America governments have been reluctant to allow travel to the meeting .
 Even Mexico, which has never broken relations with Cuba, cooperated with us with surprising effectiveness . As a result, even Mexico, even . Mexico, never . broke relations with . Cuba, Cuba's president says .
 Latin Americans continually search for inconsistency, real or imagined, in our words and deeds . However, because of our leadership in the area of Hemispheric policy toward Cuba, the Latin Americans constantly search for, and are quick to point out .
 Cuba is within the geographic zone of the Bureau . U.S. actions on the matter of Cuban travel affect ARA's responsibilities elsewhere in Latin America, he says .
 But at the same time we must put forward our views when the situation warrants . We need to be certain that full consideration will be given to them . We must be certain full consideration is given to those who want to make a decision .
 I regret that as the system of considering applications for waivers now operates, we do not believe our views are being given the consideration due them. I regret to say that . We do not think the system is being given consideration due to our views .
 I have seen enough of human institutions to know that a policy is sometimes changed without admitting it, by lowering the intensity of its administration . I have also seen many institutions change without admitting that .
 If a change in our policy on travel to Cuba is desired, then the Department ought to face up to that possibility, instead of fudging on operations .
 Cuba has announced that early next year it will host a conference of artists, scholars and writers . A conference of journalists is scheduled for July 1968 . Cuba has also announced a conference for journalists in July 1968.
 I can assure you now that we intend to cooperate as fully as possible with all interested offices to make certain that within existing USG policies toward Cuba, our travel regulations are applied in such a way as to serve our own best interests .
 "We can look forward to an improvement in the present method of reviewing applications for waivers in order to ensure that ARA's views on each case are taken into account"
 Last Friday I had a most interesting talk with CIAs new man in Cuba . CIA’s new chief in Cuba.
 He is one of their more sophisticated operators who performed so well in the DR following the 1965 revolt . He is Dave Phillipsone of their most sophisticated operators . Phillips is also known as the leader of the African National Democratic Party .
 It was aimed at stimulating Castro�s overthrow from the outside with propaganda, infiltrators, supplies, etc. etc. It was intended to stimulate Castro's overthrow from outside .
 For this purpose they had a large and not well-camouflaged establishment in Miami, Miami . It was used to hide their presence in Miami . For this, they used to have a large establishment in the city .
 The sizeable sea-borne infiltration-exfiltration capability is being dismantled and a small, more efficient one established for stand-by use is being discontinued .
 We need to know more about who his main advisers are and what they are thinking . We need more information about who he is thinking and what his advisers are .
 If there is to be a change in Cuba, it is more likely to come from defections from this group . The Cuban government has been accused of corruption in recent years .
 If Castro were to start looking for accommodation, one of them would be the first to know and probably the channel for feelers . Castro would be keen to find out if he wanted to stay in the Castro family .
 The loss of ""Che"" and the insurgency effort in Bolivia on the heels of the big LASO splash has been a serious blow . "Che" was a key figure in Bolivia's insurgency effort .
 The outlook for the government is to begin broadcasting to Cuba from private stations in the Caribbean area, including Costa Rica and Venezuela . The move is expected to take place at the end of the fiscal year .
 Relations with the Soviets are probably the testiest since the missile crisis, as reflected by Cubas actions during the 50th anniversary ceremonies . Relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union have been strained since the crisis .
 I am happy to see as politically sensitive an operator as Dave Phillips on the Cuban job at this time . Phillips is a veteran broadcaster who has been with the Cuban government for more than a decade .
 A memorandum given to Secretary Rusk by the Spanish Ambassador on December 21 /2/ reporting on a conversation between a special Spanish emissary and Fidel Castro on US-Cuban relations . Attached is a memorandum .
 In a conversation with the Spanish Foreign Minister last month, Secretary Rusk asked if Spanish diplomats in Havana were in contact with Castro . In the past, the secretary of state asked if diplomats in Cuba were in touch with Castro.
 Cuban intervention and guerrilla activities in other Latin American countries . Soviet presence of Soviet arms on Cuban soil. Cuban intervention in Latin America . Cuban intervention .
 The US, on the other hand, had no interest in interfering in Cubas internal political situation . The U.S. had no intention of interfering in the Cuban political situation, he says .
 It was not the Secretarys intention that the Spanish send a special emissary to Castro, but in their eagerness to be a bridge, they did . The Secretarys intention was not to send the Spanish emissaries to Castro .
 He said he wanted to analyze carefully the motives and timing of the message before responding to it . The message was posted on Facebook .
 Castro promises to maintain utmost discretion about the approach . Castro promised to use the same channel for any response he may decide to make . Castro says he will use same channel as any response .
 Spaniards have taken what Secretary Rusk intended to be a low-key reminder to Castro of our position and escalated it to a special message delivered by a special envoy . The Spaniards are 'self-serving reasons' for their actions, he says .
 As long as there are no leaks, this may prove to be an interesting and useful exercise . This may be a useful exercise for the government .
 If it gets out that the U.S. has taken the initiative in putting out accommodation feelers to Castro, it may prove embarrassing to us in Latin America and on the domestic political front .
 The only committee pertinent to ARA/CCA is the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on Cuba, of which I am chairman . "I am chairman of the committee," he says .
 The other agencies on the Committee are the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, currently represented by Deputy Assistant Secretary William Lang .
 Other agencies may be associated with the Committees work as necessary in particular cases .
 It is recommended that the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on Cuba now be eliminated . Inasmuch as the establishment in the intervening period of the SIG/IRG mechanism provides an instrument for coordination of matters relating to Cuba .
 Many of the factors which impelled the NSC to establish a special coordinating committee on Cuba in January 1963 have changed in focus in the last few years .
 This is necessary so that we do not give the impression to Cuba and to the world that we have finally accepted the permanence of the Castro regime in an unchanged form, says President Vladimir Putin .
 The draft does, of course, fully discuss the dangers in implementing the program . The draft also discusses the dangers of implementing such programs .
 Since the draft was first produced, internal conditions in Cuba have deteriorated strikingly . The draft has been published by the Cuban government .
 This situation has been covered in other documents, including the first draft of the IRG paper on Cuba /3/ which is now being submitted . The situation has also been covered by other documents .
 The current deterioration in Cuba gives more hope than we have had for a long time that elements in the Cuban power elite may themselves be impelled to consider whether some drastic change does not have to be made in Cubas posture toward the world if Cuba is to survive .
 I therefore think that now and for some months to come we should be even more cautious in anything we do so as not to convey a seeming signal /4/ that we have finally accepted the permanence of the Castro regime . This comes at a time when others, who have disagreed with
 It is a time for alert watchfulness and for sending of signals which encourage power elite elements to do something about Castro or some of his policies . It is not a time to seem conciliatory toward the Castro regime as such, as such . The Castro regime should not be seen as
 Special National Intelligence Estimate/1/ SNIE 8568 . Washington, June 27, 1968 .
 The United States Intelligence Board concurred in this estimate on June 27 . The U.S. intelligence board concurred with this estimate .
 A severe drought has depressed sugar production and agriculture generally . The world's sugar production has been hit hard by a severe drought .
 Living conditions have become more stringent because of reduced food supplies and other factors . Castro is trying to overcome his economic problems by forcing the population to work harder .
 There has been an increase in popular discontent and in the number of small, local disorders . There has also been a rise in small-scale protests in recent weeks .
 We see little prospect that economic adversity will significantly weaken Castro’s position over the next couple of years . Nonetheless, the U.S. should not expect economic adversity to weaken Castro's position .
 A return of more favorable weather, already in prospect, would in itself relieve domestic pressures . A return in itself would relieve domestic pressure, the government says .
 Castro would still have the advantages of charismatic appeal, political skill, and ultimately, a formidable military-security apparatus . Even if economic conditions were to deteriorate further, Castro would have advantages of charisma .
 It is unlikely that the USSR will permit the Cuban economy to approach a critical condition . The USSR will not allow Cuba's economy to reach a critical point, writes CNN.com's John Defterios .
 He will, however, seek to expand his trade with other nonCommunist countries .
 Castro's limited financial credit will restrict his trade with countries . Castro's isolation will continue to grow, but he will be reluctant to maintain diplomatic and economic isolation .
 Henry Owen, Chairman of the Policy Planning Council, obtained Rusk’s approval in May 1967, to review U.S. policy toward Cuba .
 It predicted that the effectiveness of economic denials would decline over the next few years . The political cost of U.S. policy would grow greatly, the report said .
 The paper illustrated how a scenario of incremental ""parallel"" steps might unfold, without actually recommending the specific quids and pros . The paper was published by the University of Cambridge .
 The paper concluded with a long series of courses of actions and contingencies .
 It restated basic U.S. Latin American policy ideas such as support for the Alliance for Progress . OAS regional cooperation, intelligence surveillance, and intelligence surveillance .
 This change in policy, however, was never approved, much less implemented . This change of policy never was approved .
 Any U.S. actions or concessions must fit within the OAS criteria to which we are a party, he said . OAS must avoid the impression of unilateral United States policy making .
 Vaky requested a political, economic, and security assessment from all ARA Office Directors . Your memorandum of July 25 to all Office Directors was sent to all offices .
 I assume it is unnecessary for me to give you a political, economic and security assessment of Cuba, I assume . In view of your familiarity with the Cuban situation as a result of chairing the NPP Working Group on Cuba, he says .
 You are, of course, familiar with policy issues for the reason given above and I will therefore not discuss these here . Political issues will not be discussed .
 All of the U.S. planes, crews and passengers hijacked to Cuba have been returned . The problem continues to be one of grave concern in aviation, Governmental, Congressional and press circles .
 Measures to prevent hijackers from boarding planes or, once they are aboard, are not promising . emphasis is therefore placed on the deterrence which might result from some arrangement for the return of hijackers to the U.S. for prosecution .
 Castro has no incentive to enter into an arrangement primarily of benefit to us . Cuba has not been suffering from hijacking of its planes, he says . The problem is that since Cuba hasn't been suffering hijacking, it hasn't suffered from such a problem .
 Castro would meet any request for return of hijackers with a demand for return to Cuba of all persons who escaped from the island by small boat or otherwise . We have no evidence so far that the GOC is back of these hijackings and they may .
 Anonymous Cuban exiles have been engaging in a wave of bombings and threats involving Cuban Mission to the UN and tourist or other installations of countries which have been trading with Cuba .
 This has resulted in protests of the countries involved and in intensive efforts by law enforcement authorities both to protect these installations and to apprehend the perpetrators of these acts . The protests have led to intensive efforts to protect the installations .
 Authorities have a pretty good line on a number of individuals believed to be associated with "Cuban Power" So far there have been no arrests primarily because it has been impossible to get direct evidence of guilt or catch any one in the act .
 Our Mission to the UN and we have urged the authorities to do everything possible to harass the suspects. We have urged them to harass them, says the UN .
 We still have several hundred U.S. citizens who have not been allowed to leave Cuba freely . Together with their ""fireside alien relatives"", the repatriation group is estimated to number a few thousands .
 Starting with February of this year, Castro agreed to allow the Mexicans to carry out one repatriation flight a month on a Mexican charter plane via Mexico . Castro has been criticized for allowing the repatriation flights to be carried out on Mexican charter planes .
 There are new registrations every month of United States citizens . Net figure has not been declining very much, but at least we have been getting out many of the hardship cases .
 The Mexicans hope to step up the frequency of the flights later, but do not feel the time is yet right to approach Castro about this . The Mexican government does not want to make the flights more frequent .
 The Refugee Airlift began on December 1, 1965, on the basis of two flights a day, five days a week . This has been proceeding in routine fashion ever since .
 We bring out about 3700 refugees a month and the total thus carried out is now about 120,000 . The refugees are brought in by the government, which has brought in 3700 a month .
 As of July 1, 1968, there has gone into effect a quota of 120,000 immigrants a year for the western hemisphere . This is listed as only in the sense that the influx of refugees represents a burden, financially and in terms of domestic politics .
 Cuban refugees must be counted against this with a resulting impact on the number of immigrants from other countries, including Canada and Mexico, who can be admitted .
 The airlift refugees themselves do not immediately count against this quota . When they convert into permanent residents they count as immigrants and are subtracted from the quota . The airlifted refugees are not immediately removed from the U.S.
 INS has estimated that probably 40,000 a year will have to be so counted . INS estimates that there will be 40,00 a year . Thousands of Cuban immigrants who come via Spain and other countries .
 The general issue of retention of the naval base has not been in the forefront of issues for some time . There have not been any fence-line shootings or other incidents of the type which caused tension in the past, but as long as we have the base there is always the possibility of
 Cuba has been using the base as a means of escape from Cuba . The base has been used as a military base for the past two years .
 The issue is somewhat sensitive in view of those provisions of the Guantanamo Base treaty which prohibit use of the base as a means of exit from or entry into Cuba . The treaty is based on those provisions .
 Escapees are quietly evacuated by air to the mainland where they are ""paroled"" like other refugees . We have felt that we could not turn escapees back to the GOC and they are quietly evacuated by air .
 The GOC obviously knows of this but so far has not made a public issue of it . So far, it has not been made public issue with it .
 A correlary concern of ours has been over the possibility that Castro might infiltrate agents by this route, although we subject such escapees to close screening after arrival . Such escapees are subject to close screenings after arrival, although they are not subject to further screening .
 The basic problem is that European and other countries trading with Cuba are less inclined to cooperate in our program of economic denial toward Cuba, /5/ because of commercial considerations and because of their feeling that Cuba is a U.S. problem not particularly of concern to them .
 The main obstacle to increased trade by these countries is their growing doubt as to Cubas credit worthiness in view of deteriorating economic conditions there . The main present obstacle is uncertainty as to the Soviet Union’s willingness to continue underwriting Castro .
 U.S. citizens and residents to Cuba, China, North Korea and North Viet Nam are banned . Journalists, scholars, medical men and humanitarian cases are allowed to travel to Cuba .
 Court decisions have virtually deprived the Department of the ability to enforce these controls except with respect to use of passports . Court decisions, however, have been virtually deprived of these controls .
 Persons who defy the ban are subject to no criminal penalties and not even to loss of passports unless it can be shown they used them in the banned countries .
 SCA shows little inclination to use what authority it has, says CCA . CCA has admitted limitations to its authority .
 SCA does not insist on proof that the applicant is a professional journalist . It often wants to accept as credentials the applicants own claim, supported by a letter from some publication that if he can get to Cuba the publication will print an article by him .
 SCA not requiring, as the original criteria did, that the scholar be an established one whose trip to Cuba is necessary for a particular research project . The same is true of ""scholars"", SCA does not require that they be established one who travel to Cuba .
 A constant parade of U.S. radicals to Cuba on false pretenses and genuine scholars rarely go, as they cannot get Cuban visas . "The result of all this is that we have a constant parade" of radicals, he says .
 The whole subject is such a farce that I would recommend dropping all travel controls on Cuba were it not for the fact that this would probably result in the resumption of the tourist trade on a significant scale . This would probably lead to a significant tourism resumption on the island .
 The result would be an economic advantage to Cuba but also a protection problem which, in the absence of diplomatic relations, we could not handle . Cuba would be a huge advantage to the Cuban people, says the UK's ambassador .
 Cuba is a sensitive issue to almost everyone and we are subject to constant criticism from opposite points of view . Criticism of Cuban Policy Cuba is an issue that is very sensitive to .
 Cuban exiles attack U.S. for not taking action to end Castro menace . Leftist-liberal community criticizes us for being 'rigid' in our policies, says Cuban ex-Cuban leader . Castro regime, leftist-libertarian community advocates a policy of accommodation with
 One of the perennial charges is that there are still long-range missiles or other offensive weapons in Cuba . In connection with the first school of criticism, one of the complaints is that the weapons are still in the country .
 The intelligence community maintains a constant watch on this situation and, on the basis of all the evidence, believes that there are no offensive weapons or Soviet bases in Cuba .
 Cuba presents a more continuing issue in domestic politics than other countries in the hemisphere . Excitement over this waxes and wanes but Cuba presents more of a continuing issue than any other country .
 There was a considerable discussion of what our next moves toward Cuba should be . Broe, Horton and Phillips INR. InR.
 Agency referred to a paper that it had submitted to the Department in April /2/ and which, according to Mr Vaky, was still on the Secretary’s desk .
 CIA discussed the possibility of approaching Cuban leaders around Castro to assure them that the U.S. had no wish to abrogate or wipe out the gains of the Cuban revolution . If they were prepared to cooperate covertly with CIA to provide information and perhaps to take timely action that would
 Oliver and Vaky indicated that they felt some of the language of this proposal required modification but that it might provide a basis for discussion . Oliver said some language required modification, but that the proposal might provide an opportunity to discuss the proposal .
 It was felt especially that references to a post-Castro regime or the suggestion of Castros removal were not appropriate .
 The Cuban branch in DDP/WH says it's reaching the point that CIA really had to know how our policy toward Cuba will develop .
 Mr Olivers speeches were being interpreted by some as opening up the possibility of CubanUnited States rapprochement . Some believe the speeches could open up a possible Cuban-U.S. rapproachment .
 There was a world-wide impression that secret negotiations were in fact going on between Cuba and the U.S. There was also an impression there were secret negotiations going on in Cuba .
 Oliver said that at the moment a freeze should be put on any further talk . Oliver said it merely be indicated to the Cubans that the channel would be kept open for their use .
 As to us, we have no contacts with the United States and have no desire for any . We have no contact with the U.S. and no desire to engage in any. As to them, we are not interested in any contacts with them .
 Oliver replied that the ball was in the Cuban court and that channels for negotiation existed . Oliver said we should deny that negotiations were taking place in Cuba .
 If the Cubans are interested in making an official contact, other channels are available to them . Jimenez: "Other channels" are also available to Cubans .
 Mr Vaky wanted to know if the question put by Phillips meant that the Agency intended to take the initiative in approaching Cuban intelligence, or whether CIA merely meant to remain passively prepared .
 Gardner said if rumors and reports of negotiations were working as strongly in Cubas favor as Phillips had indicated, the method of denial seemed excessively demure . Gardner said that if in fact there were negotiations, the way of denial just agreed upon seemed excessive . Gardner: If in fact
 Vaky suggested that perhaps it would be better to instruct station chiefs in Latin America to see it through their own means that denials of the negotiations were effectively made in their own countries .
 The creation of a small study group with State, Defense and CIA participation to consider the question of what exactly we should do next about Cuba was made but no definite decision was reached .
 It was agreed that another meeting should be held to review what had been said in the meeting .
 It was recognized that any decisions about changes or developments in our policy toward Cuba would have to be referred to a higher level . The Cuban government has been criticized for its lack of transparency .
