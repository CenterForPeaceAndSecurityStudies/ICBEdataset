 Not even the most talented writer can fully re-create the atmosphere of fear and imminent danger that pervaded Washington. In this day of quieter relations with Moscow, not even the best writer can .
 All of us who worked in the postwar U.S. administrations were aware that the Soviet leaders had the power to blow America off the face of the earth . We were aware of the power of the Soviets to blow the United States .
 John Kennedy served as John Kennedy's secretary of state for economic affairs . He served in the Kennedy administration . He says Kennedy's administration was beset by an ever-present doom .
 President Obama felt threatened during his early weeks in the White House . He felt critically menaced both ’ by enemies abroad and adversaries at home .
 V V I recall. example, his excuse for inaction when in early 1961 some of us discussed an initiative to normalize relations with Red;China. I recall .
 In addition to his narrow electoral victory the President was, by twentiethcentury (though not by eighteenth!! ::ii 1 ■ •;; I century) standards, far too young to be taken seriously as a statesman . He could not seriously consider tjiat project now, he^
 He maintained an outward ap* pearance of aplomb and invulnerabilabilabil. ity, but never forgot that the American people were comparing him with Eisenhower . Eisenhower's established reputation not only for overwhelming military but also for political victories had given him political self-assurance
 In Congress, his reputation had been more for absenteeism than serious achievement . In Congress he had been known for his absenteeism .
 He had never belonged to the inner circle of senators; nor was confident of the always capricious public support . His major political assets were his good looks and the glamour of a , golden boy .
 As Professor Beschloss suggests, Kennedy’s Soviet opponent in the op. posite comer appears also, but to a lesser degree, to have been unsure of himself . Kennedy's Soviet opponent appears also to be unsure of him .
 He repeatedly attributes many aspects of Khrushchev’s behavior to constraints similar to those ex-V perienced by Kennedy . Kennedy had a personal touchstone for himself .
 Khrushchev was constantly sensitive to the bitter hatred of the Soviet hard-liners . The former Soviet leader was constantly aware of the bitterness of Soviet hardliners .
 Kennedy’s feckless campaign charges of a “missile gap” between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . Defense Secretary McNamara finally had to acknowledge, that none, existed .
 In addition Castro’s Cuba formed an overhanging cloud of public shame and obsession . Castro's Cuba formed a cloud of private shame, obsession and obsession with Castro .
 I had no part in the highly restricted planning operation that preceded the Bay of Pigs fiasco . I was not involved in any of the planning operations that preceded that .
 Kennedy, as is now well known, did not initiate the Bay of Pigs project . Kennedy received it full-blown from the Eisenhower administration . Kennedy did not initiated the project but received it from Eisenhower .
 CIA had dreamed up a number of preposterous schemes to eliminate Castro . The CIA had shared the public preoccupation with Castro with Castro . Castro was the subject of a series of plots to eliminate him .
 Many were adolescent fantasies, including a plan to have Castro’s shoes dusted with a depilatory that would make his beard fall out, experts said . Experts said the plan was to deprive him of the badge of virility thought essential to lead the Cubans .
 'Track Two' of the plan plated Castro’s assassination before the Bay of Pigs invasion and involved enlistment of known American gangsters to assist in killing him . During the last year of the Eisenhower presidency the CIA had scoured the Miami community of expatriate Cubans
 High expectations had been built-up at least in intelligence circles, and the press had gained a whiff of these activities . High expectations were built up at least by intelligence circles .
 Had Kennedy been longer in office he might have realized that the plan, depended on large elements of fantasy based on dubious intelligence .
 Tha; the CIA could be so sure, for example, that the Cuban population would rise against Castro to support such an invasion is merely one more tragic example of wishful intelligence analysis by which our country has been repeatedly victimized .
 The preliminary planning and preparations had all been made by the ‘ Eisenhower administration, with the active encouragement of the vicepresident, Richard Nixon . Richard Nixon.
 Since January I960 substantial effort had gone into organizing the operation . The dilemma in which Kennedy found himself found himself was both poignant and agonizing .
 The plan had become widely known among the Cuban underground in Miami . Some leaks to the press had already occurred, and the plan had already been leaked .
 Had Kennedy abandoned the project he would have faced a considerable “disposal problem,’’ The prospect was referred to by friends and advisers .
 He would have been charged with cowardice and held up to derisory comparison with his warrior predecessor . More important, he would have faced charges of cowardice . He would also have been held up as a cowardice compared with his predecessor .
 Kennedy's fear of being criticized as a coward was reinforced by the brash encouragement of his speculator father, Joseph Kennedy, whom he visited just before making the decision to go forward .
 The U.S. Air Force should have provided air cover, that, of course, was precisely what Kennedy wished to avid .
 To me, the disaster merely confirmed a belief I had strongly held for some years— that the U.S. government should renounce covert operations . "To me, it merely confirmed that the United States government must renounce ... covert operations," he writes .
 The CIA should be limited to gathering intelligence, and its operational activities chopped off . The use of such surrogates was a source more of embarrassment than of pride . The CIA, Ihave long believed,
 More often than not our clandestine services have not only made catastrophic opera5 tional blunders but have failed to assess the probable consequences of their actions . More often, not only make catastrophic blunders, but have not been assessed the consequences of those actions .

 As I recall, p . t; in almost no case did I find any covert operations worthy of an American initiative . As I . t, p. t; almost no covert operations were worthy of being American .
 They were based on the improbable assumption that, given money or encouragement, the population of a whole country would rise against its leader . The idea was based on an assumption that given money, encouragement, a whole . population would rise . against a leader .
 Aiter Kennedy’s difficult meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961 in Vienna . Kennedy took away the impression of an aggressive mood, from which he took away from the impression . The principal emphasis of foreign policy was shifted to the repeated Soviet threat to sign a peace treaty with
 Kennedy’s attiV-' tude toward Khrushchev was conditioned by the threat of nuclear weapons . This threat, when coupled with the ' , ever-present awareness of the nuclear danger, conditioned Kennedy's atti.-tude . Kennedy's tude to Khrush
 The Soviet temptation to cut off Berlin was greatly stimulated by the swelling migration of East Germany’s most talented citizens to the West . East Germany was greatly dependent on the flow of talented people from the Soviet Union .
 The DDR would, in the Kremlin’s view, have lost most of its technical and managerial leaders, the Kremlin says . Had that brain drain been permitted to continue, the DDR would have lost some of its top leaders .
 Building the Berlin Wall relieved pressure on the Soviets to create a new Berlin crisis . Thus by halting the flight to the West, building the Berlin wall relieved pressure from the Soviets .
 As a result, Kennedy could never publicly admit it, he was relieved that the Wall might reduce pressure on him . Kennedy was privately relieved that that pressure might reduce that pressure . Kennedy never publicly admitted it .
 The President meanwhile had some difficulty defending himself from domestic political charges of timidity because he did not promptly react with force to remove the Wall . That reaction was, of course, a tightly 5 held secret in administration circles .
 The Cuban missile crisis was the biggest drama of Kennedy’s presidency . Kennedy was president of the U.S. from 1961 to 1961 .
 Secretary McNamara assured Kennedy that the missiles would make no appreciable effect on the total balance of power . But knowledge of their emplacement in Cuba would almost certainly have a devastating effect on American opinion .
 After all, America had fought two . world wars without damage to its own territory . After all the war damage was done in the U.S. territory . America fought two world wars . without damage .
 The American people had grown accustomed to thinking that the moat* of two oceans was an effective barrier to external aggression . Their leaders had made it clear since the Monroe Doctrine that they would not tolerate a European intrusion in the Western Hemisphere .
 The prospect of Soviet missiles ninety miles off our borders was something altogether different . It 'would be an affront to our history. The prospect . of Soviet missile attacks would be something else than a threat .
 The Cuban missile crisis had all the elements of an international detective thriller, a popular genre in America . It was a popular detective thriller in America, with the elements included .
 It combined secret intrigue about vastly destructive weapons, strong elements of deceit, and the danger that large numbers of innocent people would be killed . The film was based on a series of secret documents that were released in 1998 .
 The story of the crisis has been retold so often that the facts need not be rehearsed, says David Cameron . Cameron: "The story of this crisis has not been rehearsed. The facts are not rehearsed"
 The incident has been approached from diverse points of view by political scientists and historians . As might be expected, the incident has also been approached by historians and political scientists .
 Dino Brugioni served with the CIA between 1948 and 1982 . He was a member of the National Photographic Interpretation Center . He served in the CIA .
 His role in the Cuban missile crisis was no doubt significant . He understandably emphasizes the techniques that made aerial reconnaisance effective .
 Without aerial photography, the U.S. would never have detected the missiles or been able to estimate when they might become usable . Without aerial photos, the United States would not have detected them .
 Mr Brugioni's book should be read as a supplement to Professor Beschloss’s version of the crisis, he says . The book is published in Italy and the UK .
 His hero is Arthur C Lundahl, who organized the National Photographic Interpretation Center in the mid to late 1950s . Brugioni’s book reveals special information on the technical aspects of conducting photographic missions .
 I do not in any way diminish the importance of his work when I say it evoked for me a description of the Battle of Waterloo as it might have been written by a member of Wellington's staff .
 Perhaps the most coherent brief account of the incident has been written by one of its * principal participants, McGeorge Bundy, in Danger and Survival . Bundy's account is published in Danger & Survival, a history of nuclear weapons .
 Bundy, as national security adviser, was at the President’s side during the whole ordeal . Bundy was in charge of the President's national security team . Bundy has been in charge since 2009 .
 I had been a director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey at the end of the Second World War . The President received aerial photographs of work in progress to install missile launchers in Cuba .
 He then established the EXCOM, composed of the secretaries of state and defense and other relevant members of his foreign relations hierarchy . The EXCOM was established in 1953 .
 State Department officials convene in a continuous session in a conference room at the State Department . That group promptly convened in a continuing session .
 EXCOM members of EXCOM quickly discarded the first two options . After careful consideration, EXCOM decided against the other two .
 All agreed on the need to force the removal of the mis^ . siles from Cuba; the only question was ;,J how to achieve it .
 At no time in our conversation did Kennedy raise the question of the presence of Soviet missiles in A Cuba; Consequently, there was no .< need for me to say whether there * \ were any there or hot .
 State Department Soviet expert Llewellyn Thompson proved to be the most* useful member of the group . Thompson was not the most assertive participant in the EXCOM meetrings .
 He appraised Soviet reactions and the effect of suggested U.S. moves with unfailing accuracy . He also appraised the effect on suggested American moves .
 Khrushchev ’$ period, and, as Professor Beschloss makes clear, he had developed a more intimate relation with Khruschev than had any previous American ambassador . Khruschchev ‘$ period’
 As a conse-^ quence, Tommy was reassuringly knowledgeable when we tried to predict the Soviet reaction to ’ Jeach’s move we might contemplate . Tommy was comfortingly knowledgeable about how to predict a Soviet reaction .
 The missiles had been smuggled in surreptitiously and in contradiction of explicit assurances that the Soviet Union would never re, sort to such a reckless action . The missiles were smuggled in by the Soviets, despite assurances that they would never be allowed to do so .
 Gromyko had visited the President without mentioning the presence of the ‘ missiles’ and when confronted with the facts, Ambassador Dobrynin had denied that they were there .
 As we now know, Dobrynin was not lying to the President when he assured him that he knew of no missiles in Cuba . He had never been told of the event; he had not been told .
 Gromyko, however, gave a less perceptive, and skillful in framing his observations . He gave a more perceptive version of the book .
 I can think of no one else else I ever met who was so well suited to be the President’s adviser in such a complicated and unnerving period. I'm not sure who is the best person to advise the President, but I'm sure he is .
 The President did not want to open communications with Khrushchev until . he knew what action the Soviet side would take . President did want to know what action would take before he opened up .
 He feared that if America blockaded Cuba, the Russians might reply with a blockade of Berlin which would, in turn, require the use of deadly force before it was broken . In turn, he feared that Russia might respond to the U.S. blockade of Berlin .
 A blockade of Cuba would not begin with ‘‘sudden death, and it was a first step, not a last” Bundy points out . Bundy: “Many of us who participated in the missile crisis regarded the outcome as a major achievement”
 The Soviet missiles were withdrawn; the United States promised to withdraw its own outmoded missiles from Turkey and to refrain from invading Cuba . The U.S. also promised to pull out its own missiles and refrain from invasion of Cuba .
 In Deadline James Reston reflects a widely held opinion when he writes, Kennedy improved with experience . Reston: Kennedy . . improved . with experience. Kennedy .
 He was tested as no other president had been, during the Cuban missile crisis . His handling of the crisis was ... the greatest achievement of his 1 administration .
 He is obviously not happy with the way the missile criJ sis was handled; and, he implies, had he been president it simply would not have occurred .
 Beschloss treats emplacement of missiles as resulting from Kennedy’s failure to understand that his own behavior was provocative and to give Khrushchev adequate advance warning of his possible responses to the installation of missiles .
 X which the United States had an; nounced itself willing to go to nu■ v*. • ‘clear war.’ ‘’ clear war. X’ which the U.S. had an . U.K. would be willing to . go to
 Despite Khrushchev’s hints as early sis 1960 that Soviet nu/ clear missiles, might one day de; clear Cuba, as of the spring of ■>i 1962, Kennedy had yet to issue a single serious warning against them .
 In fact, such a possibility was occasionally referred to in their exchanges . "Such a possibility" was occasionally mentioned in the exchanges .
 Before the missiles were discovered, no one I know of in the Kennedy camp n believed that the Soviets would have the audacity to risk such a dangerous action .
 Had Kennedy explicitly expressed his opposition to the emplacement of * * missiles he would have had to use exactly the kind of language with regard to their forceful removal i i i that Beschloss complains about .
 Kennedy phrased his September pledge more vaguely or not at all . How different these Cabinet Room ’conversations might have been had he phrased it differently .
 Instead of discussing how to it take the missiles out, he and his advisers would now be able to consider the option of explaining to Americans they had little to fear from the missiles in Cuba .
 No president in his right mind would have failed to react incisively to the Soviets’ perfidious move . If he had not reacted, he would have had to face the need to persuade the American people that the missiles were not a threat .
 Professor Beschloss says Kennedy put the whole world at risk for no serious purpose . He says the missile crisis and the quarantine with which America responded were a reckless adventure .
 Professor Beschloss could not know at the time he wrote his book is the serious prospect of a nuclear exchange implicit in a fact only recently disclosed at a meeting between Soviet, Cuban, and American representatives .
 Khrushchev authorized the Soviet general on the spot to use them against any American advancing force if the U.S. should ever undertake an invasion of the island . U-2s spotted the missiles spotted by our U.2s .
 A continuing tension between two major military powers is like a high fever . Since the EXCOM was seriously considering such an invasion if other measures failed, the possibility of a nuclear exchange had a troubling 16 .
 The incident of the Cuban missiles provided that breaking point . It may have to reach a crisis before it can subside, and it may have been reached .
 Relations between Moscow and Washington gradually diminished in intensity . Khruschev lost his job, and the Soviet leadership recognized that their megalomaniac ambitions would inevitably be checked by effective American countermeasures .
 The missiles were not a mere gesture of bravado; they were installed through deceit and treated by Khrushchev as a major move in the ongoing contest . The missile system was installed in a deceitful way, says the historian .
 President finally accede to the hard line that several members of the EXCOM demanded . Nor did the President accede . President did not agree to a hard line .
 Minority group advocated a surprise air strike, followed by an invasion .
 Even losing the 1962 elections would have been preferable to the Kafkaesque nightmare that now faced the President . Still, Beschloss points out that even losing the election was preferable .
 Beschloss’s complaint that the President decided on a quarantine too quickly after the missiles were discovered is not consistent with his complaint that he failed to make a prompt decision on what action to take, he says .
 Beschloss: President was not in command of the crisis '££' from the start . President was at cabinet room meeting following discovery of missiles .
 "What we needed was conversation and time to reflect carefully before committing ourselves. Obviously we were all shocked a»t the discovery and what we needed is conversation," she said .
 It would, in my view, have been highly irresponsible for the President at the outset to have expressed his own views explicitly . He needed first to have his advisers explore the various implications and possibilities without being influenced by his own wishes .
 "To my mind, the discussion among members of the EXCOM was conducted at a high intellectual level, and with the somber intensity that the situation required," he says . The discussion was conducted with an intellectual level of seriousness .
 The chance to discuss a seri• ous threat for a week before being required to react was a luxury which would not now be possible . Yet, I have since concluded, that was probably the last time such a protracted debate could have been held without becoming public property .
 One contributing reason why secrecy was possible was that the White House press corps was engaged in the 1962 political campaign, leaving on Fridays with bags packed and staying on the road through Saturday and Sunday .
 I think it highly doubtful that with the changed attitude pf the press today, we could have kept the secret for the week needed to debate all its implications . Still, I think that with . the changed attitudes pf . today, it is doubtful that . with the . changed attitude
 The brash and tireless investigative reporter has now become an accepted cult figure in American life . Although great precautions are being taken to assure secrecy, exposure of inner White House secrets has become irresistible .
 Reston telephoned me at home late Saturday, October 20, or early Sunday morning, October 21, to inquire about the stories the Times reporters were gathering that the air force was being readied for an attack on Cuba . Reston called me to ask if the stories were true
 Bundy was as ambiguous as I was, but suggested that Reston call the President, Reston said . Bundy called Reston and Reston . Bundy said Reston should call the White House, but not the President .
 The President assured him that no action would be taken before his announcement due to Monday evening .
 For the Times it was a highly contentious issue since the paper had been criticized for holding back on revealing the Bay of Pigs landing .
 When I praised the press for its restraint in handling the Cuban missile crisis, Salisbury challenged me vigorously . Salisbury said Reston should not have agreed to withhold the story until after the President’s speech announcing that the missiles had been discovered and the United States would impose a blockade
 The Times made a mistake in holding back the story of the landing at the Bay of Pigs, he said . He said the paper should immediately have gone forward with what its reporters had then discovered about the missiles in Cuba .
 The late columnist Joseph Kraft, who was present on the occasion, supported my view, but it was certainly not shared by all of the Times news and editorial staff . The late columnist Joseph Kraft was present at the occasion .
 Salisbury suggested there had been a noisy row among Times staff on Tuesday . Reston implies in his memoirs that there was a row among the Times staff, Salisbury said .
 I doubt that any president could these days expect such restraint from a responsible journal in the light of sensational subsequent events, including the Watergate scandal . I doubt any president would expect this restraint from such a responsible newspaper .
 The risks of backing into a major Asian war by way of SVN are present but . ..not impressive . The risks are not impressive .
 On November 4, 1961, I met with General Taylor as well as Secretary McNamara and Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric . I was invited to the White House to meet with President Nixon on that date .
 Since McNamara and Giipatric were invariably prompt, I had a chance to talk with them before Taylor arrived . McNamara was invariably prompt .
 Vietnam was a terrain hostile to U.S. operations both physically and militarily . Vietnam was an area hostile to American operations both physical and politically .
 We. must not commit our iorccs r there or we would find ourselves in a protracted conflict far more serious than Korea . We must not engage in any of these conflicts, writes David Cameron .
 The assertion that America had committed its prestige, read in the light of the “falling domino’s theory, was felt sufficient to dispose of my arguments. The assertion . was felt enough to dispose . of his arguments.
 1 raised the question with President Kennedy on the following Tuesday, November 7, 1963 . The following day, 1 raised it with Kennedy .
 To commit Amer2, ican forces to South Vietnam would, I ;said, be a tragic etror. To commit A.I. forces to Vietnam would be a tragedy .
 Vietnam is the worst possible terrain both from a physical and political point of view. Vietnam is Vietnam, Vietnam is a very difficult place to live in, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 I have often pondered the meaning of that statement, but I am still not sure what the President had in mind . President Obama said, "I am still unsure what I have to do with my life"
 Kennedy was often asked whether, if Kennedy had lived, we would have avoided our deep involvement in the Vietnam War . Later, he was asked whether he would have lived to avoid our involvement in Vietnam .
 Once Kennedy had over fifteen thousand “advisers’ • engaged not only in giving advice but also in giving support on the battlefield . U.S. power and prestige were thought by many officials in Washington and in the . Asian capitals to be committed .
 President Johnson was more responsible for commit' ting the U.S. to that struggle, but in my view Kennedy started the slide .
 He tries to explain the complex events that marked the Keiinedy-Khrushchev relationship by stating as categorical fact exactly what was in Khrushchev's or Kennedy's mind .
 Without the psychic powers which Beschloss does not explicitly claim, no outsider can indulge in mind-reading . In the latter part of l the book, to be sure, he begins to inject qualifying phrases such as ‘it might have been’ or ‘probably,�
