 One is a unique look at the crisis by a Communist diplomat then in Washington . The diplomat was in Washington when the crisis broke out .
 Janos Radvanyi was the Hungarian charge 1 in Washington at the time (there was no ambassador), an affable fellow with whom I had | much contact . Janos was the Hungarians charge 1 at the U.S. Embassy in Washington .
 On May 17, 1967, he defected, i turning up later at Stanford where he wrote “Hungary and the Super Powers” to be pub; lished in May by the Hoover Institution .
 Radj vanyi reported home that the U.S. was overreacting to reports of Soviet activity in Cuba . What follows * is from it .
 Soviet dipt lomats here had told him that the uproar was part of the American pre-election campaign . He did so in part because Soviet officials told him they were behind the uproar .
 I Budapest received a copy of a cable to I Budapest from Hungarian Ambassador { Janos Beck in Havana . The cable was sent from the Hungarian ambassador to Havana .
 Defense Department photograph of Soviet missile installations at San Cristobal, Cuba, Oct. 1962 . as being provocatively anti-Soviet,” Radvanyi I * writes .
 The U.S. Intelligence Board’s estimate was l that the Soviets would not introduce offensive missiles into Cuba . The board's estimate was that the Soviet Union would not launch offensive missiles .
 Radvanyi attended the first of three meetings with Soviet Ambassador Anatolyi F Dobrynin and heads of all the Communist embassies in Washington . Radvanya met with the heads of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.
 Dobrynin discussed the meeting the previous day between President Kennedy and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko . Dobrynins: Kennedy's visit to the Soviet Union was the first time President Kennedy had met with Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko in Moscow .
 Kennedy-Gromyko meeting was "nothing extraordinary had happened," says Gromyko . The German situation had been discussed at length along with disarmament, he says . "Nothing extraordinary" had happened .
 Radvanyi: “It seems highly unlikely to me” that Gromyko had not been “privy to the Kremlin discussions” about the missiles . Radvanya: ‘It is altogether possible that Dobrynin may not have been informed.�
 Dobrynin “characterized it as serious and offered two reasons for his concern’s concern,” he said . Dobrynins characterizes the situation as serious . The investigation is ongoing .
 A possible U.S. attack on Cuba would almost surely kill some Soviet military personnel who had been sent to handle the sophisticated new weapons . A possible attack would almost certainly result in the death of some Soviet personnel .
 The Soviet ambassador was admitting the presence of Soviet mediumrange missiles in Cuba . Thus by implication the Soviet ambassador admitted the presence in Cuba of the missiles .
 The Pearl Harbor attack might have been responsible for this paranoia, he suggested . Pearl Harbor may have been behind this unwarranted paranoia .
 The Soviet envoy did not disclose that before the party he had met with Attorney General * Robert F Kennedy in the third floor of the embassy .
 Communist diplomats discuss dismantling of American missiles in Turkey and Cuba . Walter Lippmann's column suggested dismantling of U.S. missiles in Cuba .
 Lippmann has nevqr said whether the idea was simply his own . Only the Romanian ambassador indicated he had some reason to think that it was just that .
 Adlai Stevenson suggested a swap involving withdrawal of American missiles from Turkey and Italy and giving up the naval base at Guanv *fnamo Bay in Cuba . RFK’s account says the swap involved withdrawal of missiles from both Turkey .
 The President rejected V the proposal . Dobrynin said he still had no information on how Moscow would meet the quarantine . The proposal was rejected by the President .
 The Soviet Union found itself in a difficult position in Cuba because its supply lines were too long and the American blockade could be very effective . The Soviet ambassador concurred with my analysis, adding that the U.S. had a difficult situation in Cuba .
 Ruzek t i emarked grimly that if the Americans inI va «ed, it would definitely trigger a nuclear i war .
 At this point I lost self-control and r asked whether it was not the same to die from an American missile attack as from a Soviet one . At this time I lost control and asked if it wasn't the same for a Soviet missile attack .
 Dobrynin asked whether he planned to evacuate the families of Soviet diplomatic personnel . The families of Russian diplomatic personnel were not evacuated . Dobrynins: "Shocked" at the news .
 Unless a quick political solution were found, the U.S. would proceed with the invasion, he says . "Nothing short of a miracle could save the world from nuclear war"
 Moscow sent Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba to reason with Fidel Castro . Fidel Castro was outraged and Moscow sent Mikoyans to Russia to talk with him .
 Mikoyan explained how he tried to win Castro’s approval to the United Nations inspection of the missile dismantling process in Cuba, one of the terms to which Khrushchev had agreed, but which Castro rejected .
 They were inspected from the air, the tarpulins covering them pulled back by the Soviet sailors on ships taking them home . The planes were inspected by the Soviets in the hope they would be able to fly them home safely .
 Peking, accanvas-covered cording to Mikoyan, had sent tons of propaganda material to Havana . Mao Tse-tung had transmitted to Havana one message after another assuring the Cubans that the eight hundred , million Chinese stood firmly behind them .
 Mikoyan reported that while the Chinese had done nothing to help defend Castro, they had refrained from shelling Quemoy and Matsu during the days of the crisis .
 Mikoyan noted ironically that they might easily have stepped up pressure against Taiwan which — with the Americans involved in the Caribbean — could have j changed the whole situation ...” i .
 The missile deployment in the Caribbean is aimed at defending Castro on the one hand and at achieving a definite shift in the power relationship between the socialist and the capitalist worlds .
 He concludes that American warnings against installation of the missiles, may not have seemed all that strong to Moscow and hence the Soviets went on . The U.S. warned Moscow not to install the missiles .
 McGeorge Bundy, Mr Kennedy’s asP sistant for national security, said publicly that he knew there was “no present evidence’ of “a major offensive capability” being installed in Cuba . Bundy: “I think there is no present likelihood�
 Bundy' knew about of crates on the decks of Soviet ships in route to Cuba crates similar to those used to send IL-28 light bombers to Egypt and Indonesia . Yet the U.S. had taken pictures of the crates . The pictures were taken by Bundy' on Sept. 9
