 R GERALD HUGHES: I never thought I would live to see the day when I wanted to go to war . May.22 THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, 1962 Overt Confrontation, Covert Diplomacy and Downright Luck .
 If they carry out an attack on Cuba, a barbaric, illegal, and immoral act, then that would be the time to think about liquidating such a danger forever . General Earle Wheeler, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, October 20, 1962 .
 However harsh and terrible such a decision would be, there is no other way out in my opinion. However, however, there are no other ways out of this situation, I think .
 For the US, the crisis was initiated by the deployment of Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba . For the U.S. it was triggered by the Soviet deployment of ballistic missiles .
 In the end it was resolved by negotiation, although the clandestine nature of this meant that the details remained a closely-guarded secret .
 It seemed only a matter of time before the U.S. would invade Cuba and end the Cuban Revolution permanently . The Cuban Revolution began in 1959 .
 Castro acceded to Khrushchev’s request to install ballistic nuclear missiles on Cuba . By June 1962, the Cuban government had agreed to install missiles in Cuba .
 The installation of these missiles began later that summer in strict secrecy . The installation was later revealed to be a secret operation .
 Kennedy was under no small amount of domestic political pressure over Cuba . Kennedy was in the midst of domestic pressure over the situation .
 Republican politicians gleefully denounced Kennedy for his weakness in the face of the communist threat posed by Cuba . Republican politicians such as Senator Homer Capehart and Senator Barry Goldwater denounced Kennedy's weakness .
 In the Senate on October 10, 1962, Keating warned that the Soviets were installing nuclear missiles in Cuba . Keating: "The Soviets were actually installing nuclear missile in Cuba"
 On September 19, the CIA asserted that it was unlikely that the Soviets would deploy missiles in Cuba . The CIA says it is unlikely that it would deploy such a missile .
 On October 14, 1962, a U2 spy plane photographed Soviet R-12 medium-range ballistic missiles in Cuba . The U.S. U2 plane photographed the Soviet missiles .
 U.S. vulnerability to Soviet missiles was hardly new . Overt diplomacy: pressurise the USSR to remove the missiles . Covert diplomacy: make an approach to Castro to try and split him from the Soviets . An invasion of Cuba would have led to air strikes against Cuba .
 On October 16, the main actors in the National Security Council began to meet as the so-called Executive Committee . This body was only officially established on October 22, although this body was officially established October 22 .
 By the afternoon of October 19, 1962, senior figures in the Kennedy administration was leaning towards the blockade option . But a significant—and skeptical—minority advocated air strikes to neutralize the threat from Cuba .
 Kennedy’s military advisers remained unconvinced, 12 and it was clear that more moderate responses were strictly limited in the time they had to effect a change in Soviet policy .
 Kennedy made it clear that he would not permit offensive weapons to remain in 7 SNIE 85-3-62, “The Military Buildup in Cuba”, September 19, 1962 .
 After several days of tension, Khrushchev sent a conciliatory proposal that was still under consideration in Washington . It was followed by a letter setting out a hard-line position . The proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union .
 Attorney General suggested replying only to Khrushchev’s first letter, and accepting its terms . At this juncture Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, the president’�s brother, suggested that he would only reply to the letter .
 The deal that ended the crisis entailed the Soviet Union dismantling and removing its offensive weapons from Cuba . The Soviet Union also removed its weapons from the country .
 The deal also involved a secret assurance whereby the United States agreed that it would dismantle all its Jupiter MRBMs in Turkey . The U.S. agreed to dismantle the Jupiter missiles in Turkey, Turkey .
 The first letter on the fateful weekend of the crisis had requested only the ‘no-invasion” pledge from the US . The second letter additionally demanded the removal of the Jupiters from Turkey .
 To accede to this latter demand in public would have been political suicide for Kennedy . Kennedy would have faced political suicide if he had acceded to this demand .
 A secret agreement robbed Khrushchev of any significant political capital he could derive from the resolution of the crisis . The secret agreement was effectively a defeat for the Soviet Union in the 1960s .
 Members of the group that had conducted U.S. policy during the crisis acted to preserve the myth that Kennedy had stood firm and refused to withdraw the Jupiters .
 The ‘Quarantine’ of Cuba ended on November 21, 1962, following the departure of the Soviet missiles . The “Quarantine of Cuba’s Cuba” ended in 1962 . The Cuban state of Cuba was declared a quarantine by the Soviet Union .
 Influential insider accounts cast Kennedy in heroic mold, an individual who had mastered the structures of international politics . Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 in Washington, DC .
 The taped consultations demonstrate that Kennedy had successfully managed the crisis to a remarkable extent, although he had been assisted by Khrushchev and enjoyed some real strokes of fortune .
 The Moscow-Washington Hot Line was established in June 1963 . The nuclear age demanded better lines of direct communication .
 The pursuit of détente, so Kennedy’s admirers insisted, would have been a central policy of a Kennedy second term . Kennedy's admirers said he would have pursued a denteente relationship with the West .
 Between 1987 and 1992, the historiography of the crisis was driven forward by critical oral history conferences . Historians of the 1980s and 1990s were driven forward in the wake of the collapse of Yugoslavia .
 McNamara continued to downplay the risk of war in October 1962 . He found support for his position from Sorensen and Bundy . During the 1989 Moscow conference, McNamara downplayed the risk .
 The underestimation of Soviet forces in Cuba in 1962, allied to the pressures for a military solution, meant that the U.S. was far closer to war with the USSR than anyone realized at the time . Indeed, the underestimation meant the United States was close to war .
 The absence of trust, the information asymmetry between the two sides and the lack of direct communication between the military headquarters make the event look very vulnerable to an escalation . In negotiation terms, the absence of . trust and the . lack of trust makes the event vulnerable .
 The Cuba crisis avoided this trap due to luck . Political leaders should continue to think about how to handle such extreme cases, writes CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Moscow-Washington hotline was established in 1962 . Moscow and Washington established a hotline to prevent Soviet-Russian tensions . The hotline was set up in Moscow in 1961 .
 30 crisis management and détente require constant interaction and negotiation . This demonstrated that, beyond whatever strategies can be put in place in order to handle such gamed theoretical cases, crisis management requires constant interaction, negotiation and interaction .
 In ‘chicken’, war is the mutual worst option, whilst defeat is the second-worst option . In “chicken,” war is war, while defeat is a second worst option .
 The disastrous policy of Appeasement in the 1930s had forever handicapped policymakers in their pursuit of peaceful solutions to diplomatic crises . The policy was forever handicaped policymakers in the pursuit of peace .
 It was the combination of high-risk nuclear gamble and volatile domestic political considerations that made the Cuban missile crisis so dangerous . It was a high risk nuclear gamble that made it so dangerous. The U.S. government's decision to launch a missile strike in Cuba was a major mistake .
 In the nuclear age the delicate art of balancing the maintenance of vital national interests against the danger of nuclear war has strained the sinews of statesmen for over 70 years now .
