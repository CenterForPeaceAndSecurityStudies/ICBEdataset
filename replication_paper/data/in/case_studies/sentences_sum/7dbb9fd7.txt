 The speech was aimed at moving forward that agreement—and it succeeded . It succeeded, and it succeeded.
 Seven weeks later, a treaty that was almost unimaginable to most Americans and to many elsewhere in the world was signed . One month after that, it was ratified by the United States Senate, which is a near-miracle .
 The treaty was ratified by an overwhelming majority of 80 to 19 . It was ratified not only by the two-thirds required under the U.S. Constitution for a treaty .
 JFK’s quest for peace is the story of leadership; how John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev helped to guide the world from October 1962 through to September 1963 . The treaty was presented at the United Nations in Kennedy's last speech to the General Assembly on 20 September 1963
 The entire world, with only the notable exceptions of China and France, participated in a global expression of profound relief and a sense of having turned away from a disaster as close as could be imagined to a chance, at last, for peace . Only the exceptions of France and China participated in
 Kennedy had accomplished something of definitive and lasting value . Kennedy's legacy will never be forgotten, but he had something of lasting value.
 He proved by accomplishment that it was possible to reach a binding agreement with the Soviet Union that was in the interests of both sides, and that would be honoured, as indeed it was .
 This is an edited version of a talk given by the author at Chatham House in July 2013 . Not only was that treaty secured, ratified and proved successful, but it was followed—as Kennedy anticipated, hoped and planned—five years later by an assassination .
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was an even more important treaty . The treaty was signed by the U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1968 .
 This treaty has by no means solved the world’s problems, but it has dramatically reduced the chances of mass proliferation of nuclear weapons . The treaty has since been signed by the U.S. President Barack Obama .
 Kennedy believed there could be 40 nuclear powers by the 1980s if something was not done to stop the proliferation process . This is, of course, an issue we continue to grapple with every day, but Kennedy believed .
 In explaining and expressing our common humanity, our common experience of living on a crowded planet, this is as compelling an expression of our shared human fate as is possible . This is the most compelling expression of humanity as possible .
 One is that it arguably saved the world, since the record up until 1963 was not one of a stable balance of terror, as some of the game theorists of the nuclear age believed . The world was filled with accidents and misjudgements and near-disasters, as I fear it
 The last year of Obama's life is a period of nearly miraculous leadership . Almost everything done right, but many things had been done wrong during the first two years of his presidency .
 Most powerfully, this is an episode that demonstrates that what is taken to be the conventional wisdom can be disastrously wrong . The episode is a reminder that the 'conventional wisdom' can be wronged .
 The same is very much true today in international relations, from the moment-by-moment developments in Egypt or Iran or Syria to the more slow-moving issues of how we face the challenges of climate change and planetary wreckage .
 There are a lot of smart people around -- they're in 10 Downing Street, they're at the White House, they’re in all the corridors of power . They are not solving our problems, they are not even coming close. There are not solutions to our problems; they
 It’s important for us to capture, to understand, to savour; one from which to draw lessons that are appropriate and applicable for us today . And therefore it’�s a moment that we should capture, understand, and savour. And therefore, it�
 "It takes place at a time in which the two superpowers were each filled with ideas about the other that were dangerous, misguided, unnecessary, and ultimately had enormously high potential for destruction," says author .
 Both sides felt that they were most likely engaged in a battle to the end for the fate of the planet . Either the United States would come to defeat communism, if necessary by war, or that communism would take over the world in its godless manner .
 Both sides were struggling with far more mundane matters of trying to keep their economies afloat, facing challenges of civil rights, dealing with civil rights .
 The notion on each side was that the counterpart was an implacable foe, ready to do anything, however irrational, however evil, to gain global domination, was very strong . But the notion on both sides that the . counterpart was . ready to . do anything . However irrational,
 Of course, it was not held universally, by any means; there were powerful voices for peace . "Peace" was not universally held universally; there was powerful voices .
 There were peace movements; there were anti-nuclear movements of tremendous significance all over the world . Peace movements, anti-nuke movements were of enormous significance, says historian .
 There were hard-liners on both sides exerting constant pressure on each side . Hard-liners tend to dominate when there is doubt on one side or the other . But there was no doubt on either side when there was doubt .
 The 'prisoner's dilemma' is reflected in the so-called ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ and the threat of escalation . Either of two sides fears that any step back from a hard line would be nothing more than appeasing the enemy . And that basic logic
 The fear of being soft in the face of a foe was a big fear politically as well as strategically . The Munich agreement and the lead-up to the Second World War were only very recent history .
 Both sides were groping for some manner of mutual accommodation after Stalin’s death in 1953 . Both sides built their nuclear arsenals in the 1950s and '60s .
 Eisenhower was keen to find some way to reach an accommodation with the Soviet Union . Yet he was surrounded by hard-liners in the U.S.
 Churchill referred to Dulles by Churchill as ‘dull, duller, Dulles’ Dulles . Dulles was a terrible Secretary of State, Churchill said .
 The second agent of constant unrest and destructiveness was the CIA, the agency that has continued its disastrous tradition up to the present day . The CIA has continued their disastrous tradition .
 During the 1950s, they prevented Eisenhower from taking any bold or daring initiatives . Eisenhower took a very collegial and bureaucratic view of the presidency, he says .
 Mr Khrushchev and I occupy approximately the same political positions inside our governments. One of the ironic things about this entire situation is that Mr Khruschev and me occupy approximately . The former Soviet Union leader said: "One of the irony things about the entire situation was ... Mr Kh
 Both sides had proceeded some way down the path to a nuclear test ban . But this process ground to a halt, for two main reasons . Kennedy and Khrushchev at the Vienna summit, April 1961 .
 Eisenhower toyed with the idea of sharing nuclear weapons with Germany, which was Russia's biggest fear by far . Russia’s biggest fear was the threat of sharing nukes with Germany . Eisenhower's decision to take action against Germany was a mistake .
 This was an example of the U.S.’s lack of self-reflection or understanding of legitimate Soviet security concerns, author says . “This was a failure of the United States. It was a mistake,” he writes .
 At the end of the 1950s there was a proposition for something called the Multilateral Force . It was based on the idea of sharing nuclear weapons in some form .
 JFK and the future of global leadership would gain access to nuclear weapons . JFK would have access to the weapons of the future . JFK was assassinated in 1968 . JFK believed to be the only person in the world to be assassinated in the U.S.
 Eisenhower’s point of view: US troops could come home, it would be a lot cheaper, save money on the budget . But of course, this was as grave a strategic threat as could be imagined for the Soviet Union, given the history of destruction that Germany had caused just
 Of course, the Soviets knew very well, and the CIA knew that they knew, that these overflights were taking place . The CIA knew, of course, that overflights would be taking place, says the CIA .
 They intercepted pilot Gary Powers, shot down the U2, captured him alive, captured and collected the wreckage of the plane . They announced that a spy plane had been shot down, and announced it was a U2 .
 Eisenhower lied that the intercepted plane had been on a weather surveillance flight launched from Turkey . The Soviet side produced Mr Powers and the U2 wreckage for global television .
 Kennedy came into office in January 1961 determined to find a path to peace . Kennedy was determined to make peace in the world .
 He was determined that he would settle issues with the Soviet Union, and find a way back from the nuclear arms race . "He was determined to settle issues," he said .
 Kennedy resisted, as Eisenhower had a year earlier, but was assured that the military brass and the CIA guaranteed that nothing could go wrong . Kennedy resisted as Eisenhower did, but he was assured of a year later .
 Kennedy foolishly agreed to the plan, but agreed in the most absurd way, saying that the invasion would take place but there would be no US air cover for it . This guaranteed that when the Cubans landed in the Bay of Pigs they were immediately captured or killed .
 The planes which are bombing Cuban cities belong to the United States of America . The bombs they are dropping are being supplied by the American Government .
 All of this evokes here in the Soviet Union an understandable feeling of indignation on the part of the Soviet Government and the Soviet people . The Soviet government and Soviet people are said to be outraged by the events in Russia .
 Twice within a year, he had been directly lied to by the President of the U.S. on an issue of the highest security . He had been lied to twice in a year .
 Such is our smart international politics, of the kind that we rely on to this moment, says David Cameron . Such is the kind of of a smart international diplomacy, he says .
 If the United States was going to threaten to invade Cuba, the Soviets would defend Cuba . If the U.S. threatened to invade, the Soviet Union would back Cuba, it would defend the country .
 If the U.S. had intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Turkey, the Soviets would have missiles in Cuba . If the United States had such a situation, the Soviet Union would have a similar situation in Cuba, says historian .
 Khrushchev denied that the Soviet Union would use Cuba as an offensive base . Of course, he lied blatantly and brazenly, and denied that he did .
 Kennedy asked repeatedly, and insisted that placing such missiles in Cuba would be viewed as a casus belli, that this was intolerable from the U.S. point of view . Kennedy: "This was intolerable"
 The Soviet Union, from top to bottom, assured that this would never be done, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 It was just about the stupidest thing in the world imaginable, which is what our leaders are always capable of doing, he says . It was about the stupidityest thing imaginable, he adds .
 Kennedy was thrown onto the back foot because his political opponents were insisting the Soviet Union was building a base in Cuba for offensive missiles . Kennedy insisted again and again that wasn’t the case .
 Kennedy could not afford to lose face by abandoning this commitment, he says . When that was indeed revealed to be the case, Kennedy must not abandon this commitment .
 What happened next is too well known to need recounting in detail here; but it is worth emphasizing just how many accidents nearly occurred in 13 days . Many advisers on both sides gave precisely the advice that would have ended humanity .
 It’s our undeserved blessing that it happened, because it could have turned out so differently; but in the end the crisis ended, he says . "From that moment on, these were two uniquely changed individuals," he says of the two men .
 Never in history had two leaders experienced what they had just experienced . President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were both at the top of the polls .
 This wasn't about two countries, this wasn’t about war; this was about the world,’s president says . ‘This was about a world. This was the world,' he says .
 He had come to office as a student of history, he said . He was aware of how stupidities could multiply, he added . He said .
 Winston Churchill and Barbara Tuchman argued that this was a case in which both sides stumbled into disaster—stumbled, by accident, for no deep reason . He had closely studied the First World War, reading analyses by Winston Churchill .
 The last year of Kennedy’s presidency and life is a year of a complete change in tone, capacity, quality of leadership and determination to get it right . Kennedy's life is being marked by a change of tone .
 The peace speech was written nearly in secret, without the standard intergovernmental, interdepartmental reviews . "Peace speech" was written in secret in secret .
 It was a draft by Kennedy and Ted Sorensen, and was seen by very, very few others . The draft by Ted Kennedy and Kennedy was not seen by many others . It was the first draft of the war .
 "This is an approach that I don’t think I’ve seen taken before or since by any American president," he says . This is a bold move for the president, he adds .
 Some say that it is useless to speak of peace or world law, or world disarmament, and that it will be useless until the leaders of the Soviet Union adopt a more enlightened attitude .
 I believe we can help them do it, but I also believe that we must re-examine our own attitudes as individuals and as a nation, for our attitude is as essential as theirs . I believe our attitude should be as important as theirs, but we also need to re-
 Kennedy's genius was to dig deep, and put the international challenge on a moral basis and on a common human basis . Kennedy’s genius was that he dug deep, he said, to put the global challenge on moral basis .
