 Cuban missile crisis; game theory; threat that leaves something to chance; metagame theory; theory of moves; analytic narrative 1.1. 1.2.3.4.5.5 .
 When players in a real-world game make choices that can plausibly be associated with an equilibrium outcome, a game-theoretic explanation has been uncovered . Players in the game can make decisions that can be linked to equilibrium outcomes .
 Game-theoretic predictions about future play presume rational choice . The assumption is that an equilibrium choice will be made by each of the players . The definition of an equilibrium depends on whether the game’s depiction is dynamic .
 In Chicken, the assumption is that each player most-prefers to win and, failing that, to compromise . Chicken is a game of chicken versus chicken, with the aim of winning and compromise .
 The outcome called Conflict is the lowest ranked outcome of both players . Chicken presents a number of perplexing analytic problems . The outcome is Conflict .
 A Nash equilibrium is the accepted measure of rational behavior in normal-form games with complete information . Nash equilibrium measures the behavior of players in Nash equilibrium games .
 Dobbs and Trachtenberg find little evidence of the mathematically precise manipulation of threat levels that Schlesinger wrote about . Dobbs: "There is little evidence that this is true"
 In the years immediately after Schelling wrote, a determinative assessment of his interpretation of the crisis was problematic . Thus, before rejecting Schelling’s explanation of the missile crisis, a more compelling reason would have to be given .
 If the Cuban crisis were truly a competition in risk taking, there could have been no compromise; there would either have been a clear “winner” or a thermonuclear war . Schelling’s interpretation of the Cuban missile crisis and, arguably, of most other intense
 The lack of fit between Schelling’s theoretical explanation and the resolution of the crisis is disturbing . The historical record shows that Kennedy was more than eager to compromise, and that he was willing to offer much more .
 Howard implicitly accepts what is now the standard understanding of the resolution of the crisis’s resolution, that is that it was a draw .
 Howard’s reformulation of classical game theory is as a theory of equilibrium selection . Stable outcomes of the metagame are termed metaequilibria . Howard's theory is based on equilibrium selection theory .
 The United States must intend to cooperate by blockading Cuba if the Soviet Union cooperates by withdrawing the missiles . This is an interesting and potentially important theoretical result .
 Which metaequilibrium comes into play depends on what the players expect from one another, or what they communicate to each other, in pre-play bargaining and discussion .
 The metastrategy A/B/B-A is weakly dominant for the United States, giving the Soviet Union good reason to suspect that the U.S. would choose it . M Regardless is the best response to A/A, and since it's a good response to
 Howard rejects this outcome as the solution to the metagame, and denies that any particular reason exists for singling it out . All of which suggests that the metaequilibrium associated with these two metastrategies, which would bring about a Soviet victory, might well evolve in an
 If the U.S. were to select its retaliatory metastrategy A/A/B/A and the Soviet Union, anticipating the sure-thing metastrategy M, selects M . Regardless, each player’s worst outcome, Conflict, results .
 Fraser and Hipel’s analysis of options technique should be interpreted, at least in part, as a proto-theory of equilibrium selection . Like Howard’�s theory of metagames, the analysis of the options technique can be interpreted as an equilibrium selection theory .
 Perform no aggressive action, either by doing nothing or by using diplomatic channels to try to induce the Soviets to remove the missiles . Destroy the missile sites with an air strike, or blockade Cuba; and three for the Soviet Union: Withdraw the missiles,Maintain the missiles orEsc
 Fraser and Hipel assume that the United States most-prefers outcome 4 to outcome 6 . Fraser, Hipel assumed that the U.S. would prefer outcomes 4 to 6 .
 They ask whether any of the outcomes offer either player a ‘unilateral improvement’ They say it is defined as a better outcome a player can induce by unilaterally changing its strategy . Next, they ask if any outcome offers a “unilateral improvement”
 Although outcome 0 is rational for the Soviet Union, it is unstable for the United States . The U.S. can induce three other outcomes it prefers to outcome 0 simply by switching to another course of action .
 Of these three unilateral improvements, outcome 2 would be the United States preference . The United States prefers outcome 2 .
 The likely Soviet response to the blockade can be also deduced from its incentive structure . Hence, the United States reaction to the U.S. reaction .
 Brams abandons both a normal-form representation and the standard Chicken analogy . Here I concentrate on the theoretical core of all his explanations and ignore the subtle differences .
 When Kennedy announced the blockade on October 22, the Soviet missiles were already being installed in Cuba . The blockade was already underway when Kennedy announced it .
 Brams argues that the Soviet Union would stick with its choice to withdraw missiles simply because, by not doing so, it would only cycle back to the Compromise outcome . The United States would, perhaps, also move to its best outcome, not because it is its best, but
 Brams' explanation proceeds from this fact . Neither player has a long-term incentive to move away from this outcome if and when it is reached .
 The Soviet Union withdrew missiles because, looking ahead, they believed that maintaining them would not be in their long-term interest . All of which is another way of saying that they withdrew the missiles .
 There is obviously much to like about the Theory of Moves framework . Given the American blockade and the incentive structure of the game, they simply could not win .
 U.S. and Soviet Union's crisis bargaining model is based on what must have been true for Khrushchev to introduce missiles in Cuba, Kennedy to have implemented a blockade and the bargain that ended the crisis to have come about .
 The crisis was not a “competition in risk taking” as Schelling suggests; rather it was an exercise in bargaining and information gathering . Both Kennedy and Khrushchev lacked complete information about one another’s preferences .
 Wagner’s method is to deduce preferences from action choices, but it cannot but fail to fully explain actual behavior . For that, a general model that identifies a plausible equilibrium, and specifies the general conditions under which it exists, is necessary .
 Clearly, space and other considerations preclude either a full description of the model or a detailed discussion of the explanation derived from it .
 The improved metagame technique of Fraser and Hipel falls short of the explanatory mark . It is less than satisfying for rational choice explanations that reject some of the logical imperatives of the rationality postulate .
 Brams’ theory of moves framework avoids the arbitrary foresight limitation that Fraser and Hipel assume of the players in their model . Finally, since their description of the crisis begins after the missiles were installed, they fail to address one of the three critical questions that a complete explanation of
 Brams takes as his starting point as the announcement of the blockade on October 22 . The blockade is expected to begin on October 25 .
 Study: Bargaining Equilibrium in Games and Social Situations . The study was published in the book "Rational Behavior" and "Bargain Equilibrium" in Games .
 The “threat-that-leaves-something-to-chance” depends on the possibility of an accidental war, Quackenbush says . For a discussion, see Rapoport, , 119.6 .
 Empirical examples of accidental wars, including World War I, are nonexistent . Snyder and Diesing also find no example of the use of coercive bargaining tactics in the sixteen major interstate crises they studied .
 Powell also shows that under certain conditions no challenge will be made and, hence, stable mutual deterrence can emerge . See also Huth, Danilovic and Dixit and Skeath .
 Zagare and Kilgour challenge the adequacy of this deduction . The same is true of Dixit and Skeath’s model. The same was true of the model.
 Powell’s model suggests that when deterrence breaks down, the connection between resolve and victory in a crisis does not always depend on a greater willingness to risk war .
 There is a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies in Chicken . Brams assigns different utilities to different utilities .
 A metaequilibrium is simply a Nash equilibrium in the metagame . Fraser and Hipel do not provide a detailed justification for their preference assumptions .
 Fraser and Hipel also describe a computational model, called the state transition model, that conforms to the actual outcome of the crisis . Their assumptions are not particularly unreasonable .
 Brams also develops a few explanations using standard game-theoretic concepts . While it uses the input of their improved metagame technique, it is not a game-model model .
 Brams constructed an extensive-form game model in which the compromise outcome is a Nash equilibrium . Brams shows that it was in the interest of the United States to allow the Soviet Union to precipitate the move counter-move process .
 A subgame-perfect equilibrium requires the players to plan to choose rationally at every node of the game tree . Thus, the United States could afford to be ‘magnanimous’ in 1962 .
 A sequential equilibrium is a refinement of perfect Bayesian equilibrium . It must indicate how each player updates its beliefs about other players’ types in the light of new information obtained as the game is played out .
 Schelling was right to dismiss Schelling’s characterization of the Cuban crisis, but for the wrong reasons . For a discussion, see Morrow .26 .
 The fact that the Soviets did not make their alert known to U.S. decision-makers is inconsistent with Schelling’s interpretation of the crisis . Schelling's approach, called revealed preferences, should be contrasted with posited preferences that assumes an actor's goals .
 This explanation is both theoretically and empirically inconsistent with Schelling’s . See also Hausman .
