 This article reveals the role of RFK to have been far more complex, fluid and essential in the successful resolution of the crisis than such rigid demarcations can encompass . RFK's role in resolving the crisis was far more fluid and fluid than rigid rules can encompass, it has been
 Taken collectively these amount to an idiosyncratic and unique role . Quite apart from their individual contributions, taken collectively they amount to a unique role in the world .
 This article argues that it was a role that could not have been fulfilled by any other individual . It argues that without which the crisis may have been averted, it may not have averted .
 Robert F Kennedy received an urgent phone call from his brother, President Kennedy, informing him that he had lost his job . The article was published in October 1962 in the United States .
 Thank you to Mum and Dad, who first set me on this path with our passionate dinnertable debates and to whom I owe so much. Thank you .
 Thank you to my wife Abigail for her loving support and patience throughout, and all in our beautiful daughter Cora .
 The weeks that followed remain the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war . The weeks following the war were the closest moments of nuclear war ever seen .
 Nuclear missiles now lay in place 90 miles off the U.S. coast, contrary to the express assurances of Soviet Premier Khrushchev to the contrary, and in the face of repeated warnings from President Kennedy in preceding months . The missiles now lie 90 miles from the United States coast .
 President Kennedy and his administration had no option but to respond – triggering a stand-off between two nuclear superpowers, each with their own just cause . Politically and strategically, President Kennedy . President Kennedy had no choice but to go nuclear .
 The study of the resolution of the crisis is one of the most fascinating and instructive periods in modern history . The stakes involved, and the richness of the primary source material available, make the study of this crisis an important part of history .
 His unique judgement and counsel to the President throughout the crisis was essential to its successful resolution, and indispensable to the president . His unique and particular judgement .
 RFK acted as de-facto Chief of Staff, Presidential Agent and Intermediary for his brother . RFK was the President's Secretary of State in the late 1960s and early 1960s .
 As President Kennedy’s trusted proxy, RFK enabled the President to circumnavigate the often opaque and invariably sluggish formal channels of government but also to gather, organise and relay frank assessments and advice from others, unhindered by presidential deference . RFK was President Kennedy
 The Kennedy administration’s antagonistic policies toward Cuba were the products of a confrontational mind-set fuelled by Cold War ideologies . Events such as the Bay of Pigs served only to drive Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and Cuban premier Fidel Castro to desperate measures3.
 Khrushchev's underestimation of likely U.S. reaction to placement of nuclear weapons in Cuba in Cuba was a mistake . The two administrations have decried the mistaken assumptions made of each other by both sides . They have also decried mistaken assumptions by both governments .
 They have criticised the secrecy of the Jupiter trade and the resulting impact this had on U.S. foreign policy for decades after . The Jupiter trade has been criticised for its impact on foreign policy .
 All these insights, and more, are important contributions to our understanding of the crisis, say experts . We are happy to share our insights with the world's first responders .
 RFK’s contribution to handling of the crisis is not fully or fairly assessed . RFK's contribution to the handling of RFK is not considered fully or fair to be considered, he says .
 Few crises can be so neatly constrained to such a precise timetable – certainly the crisis had its roots far before than than than October 16th and was not conclusively resolved until several months later . The crisis was not resolved until after several months .
 Overflights to ensure missiles were removed and not replaced continued well after October 28th . Negotiations to resolve the crisis also continued long after that .
 RFK's critical role in the crisis rested upon relationships built long before these thirteen days . RFK’s critical role rested on relationships built before these 13 days, he says .
 The EXCOMM enlarged the regular membership of the National Security Council, which included, among others, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Director of Intelligence John McCone .
 The EXCOMM included RFK, White House counsel Theodore Sorensen and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Llewellyn Thompson . RFK and eleven other key advisors across senior government, met regularly over the thirteen-day period .
 The tapes of this period, enabled by President Kennedy’s placement of recording devices in key rooms in the White House, reveal much about the management of the crisis and RFK's role within it . The tapes were enabled by the placement of . President Kennedy's placement of devices in
 No evidence yet points to RFK being aware of EXCOMM tapes in 1962 . RFK was not aware of them in 1962, according to reports .
 Were he to have been aware of them there is little sign of him self-censoring. Furthermore, were he . to have known them there are little signs of him . self- censoring .
 Historians have dismantled myths around President Kennedy and his administration, including one of its principal moments of glory . Subsequently, historians have dismantled the myths around the Kennedy administration .
 Some are not directly relevant to the central argument of this article, but it is worth addressing them at the outset as they are useful context . Some of the points are not relevant to this article but are useful to the main argument .
 'heroic interpretation of Robert Kennedy’s contribution’ is ‘rooted’ in his own apparently self-serving memoir, 12 Schlesinger Jr., Robert Kennedy and His Times, 531 .
 A useful overview can be found in Dylan Matthews’s ‘Americans think John F Kennedy was one of our greatest presidents.’
 White’s contention is that historians took their lead from its chief claims . White says the Cold War drama was an insider's account of this most famous Cold War .
 Writing before the crisis had even begun, RFK reveals a contemporary view of RFK not incompatible with the leading role revealed in the Thirteen Days memoir .
 The view that RFK was himself was himself the chief propagator of his predominant and crucial role – in fact, others had spoken to that effect far earlier, and several key participants corroborated his perspective .
 RFK’s memoir, nor the crisis dynamics it describes, can or should be completely disregarded . RFK's memoir, or crisis dynamics, should not be disregarded, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Stern, for example, continues to quote a second-hand exchange between RFK and Kenneth O’Donnell, JFK’s special assistant and confidante during the crisis, to undermine the veracity of RFK’S memoir Thirteen Days . Stern: "Stern
 The post-revisionist view should be treated with as much caution as the revisionist and heroic narratives . Thus the post-resignist view is treated as much with caution .
 To address the post-revisionist view this article argues for a reappraisal of RFK’s central role in the resolution of the crisis . RFK provided the unique and indispensable support he provided the President as brother and administration member .
 President Obama has a unique role - more a Presidential partner than advisor . The role is more of a President's partner than an advisor, he says .
 The Evolving American Presidency Series . 9 complex, fluid and essential in the successful resolution of the crisis than rigid demarcations of either early or post-revisionist perspectives .
 RFK as an indispensable advisor in his own right during the crisis . We are talking about his unique and particular judgement and counsel as events transpired .
 As long as there have been articles written about JFK, writers have observed the intimate role of his brother Robert – not merely as a close family member, but as an advisor and even partner .
 JFK’s younger brother's role grew in stature with each successive campaign, manifestly in recognition of RFK's successful qualities . Contemporary newsmen and commentators first heralded his role in JFK's political campaigns 24 years ago .
 For their working relationship was by no means a familial certainty,25 but one earned in the crucible of political endeavour . The relationship was no means of familial certainty .
 Of course, the exact breadth and nature of these qualities was debated then and remains a source of debate now . The exact breadth of the qualities that were debated then was debated .
 RFK's tenaciousness and dogged pursuit of his brother's ambition can be concluded with some confidence . RFK’s tenacity is tenacious and his pursuit of ambition .
 For an early article on the collaboration of the two brothers, see ‘The Rise of the Brothers Kennedy’ in Look, 6 August 1957 . By 1960, it had 24 people in the world .
 RFK was the ‘only choice’ as campaign manager for JFK’s presidential bid . RFK's Life, 59. 10, will be broadcast at 9 p.m. ET on Monday, November 11 .
 New President ensured his younger brother had a central role in his subsequent administration . And commentators were surprised at his appointment as Attorney General .
 The appointment cemented a progression from family member, to supportive campaign manager, to political collaborator and finally to a central advisor of his Presidency .
 RFK could speak truth to power because of his familial intimacy with the President . RFK spoke truth to the President because he was close to him, says historian .
 There was a consensus amongst presidential advisors that RFK’s voice was a uniquely personal one, able to cut through to the President where others could not . RFK's voice was uniquely personal, says President John Kennedy .
 White House Press Secretary Christine Camp described RFK's position as being in the innermost circle of Presidential advisors, privileged above all others as JFK’s ‘close friend and confidante’ 27.
 RFK could raise the spectre of nuclear emplacement on Cuba mere days after the President had suffered the greatest blow of his Presidency at the Bay of Pigs, a time when JFK least wanted to hear it .
 Prior to April 1961, RFK was an important but not indispensable part of his brother’s Administration . RFK's brother was a member of the Kennedy administration but not an indispensable part .
 JFK learnt from the Bay of Pigs fiasco of the limits to, and dangers of, organisational reliance . JFK learnt the limits of, and the dangers, of, organisation reliance .
 Brother Protector, , 417. 12 . 12 comprehensiveness of their intelligence, their playbook-approach to Soviet ‘aggression’ and their failure to anticipate likely Soviet responses . Brother Protector is the author of the book, The Brother Protector .
 JFK's dogged questioning of proposed courses of action ensured JFK heard everything he thought he needed to, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 Third was his innate understanding of the crisis as more of a political struggle than a military one, with its own limitations .
 JFK administration united in shock after U-2 photos showed Soviet missiles in Cuba . JFK administration was united in shocked by the discovery of Soviet missile sites .
 This was because the bureaucracy around them had concluded that, strategically, the Soviets would not do so . The bureaucracy around the Soviet Union concluded that it would not be able to defeat the U.S. This was .
 As the President himself would remark on the first day of the crisis, ‘not many of us thought that he was going to put MRBMs on Cuba’35.35.
 This should be known and understood by those who are planning a project . This should not be known by those planning to build a project, it should be understood .
 RFK was not one to close the book on an issue merely because the ‘experts’ had. RFK would not be one to back down on the issue . RFK is not one of the 'experts' who closed the book .
 He had learnt the hard way that departmental experts should not be followed blindly . He said he had learnt that departmentists should not follow blindly .
 His private notes on the Bay of Pigs indicate that he judged ‘underestimation’ by the United States of Castro’s forces as a key cause of the fiasco 38 years ago .
 RFK’s prescience on this issue continues to be overlooked in recent histories of the crisis . Recent histories emphasise the failure in predicting the deployment of Soviet nuclear forces in Cuba, whilst ignoring the voice of RFK .
 Correcting this oversight is important, as left unchallenged it is in danger of perpetuating itself . Correcting the oversight is crucial, as it is a danger to perpetuate itself .
 U.S. reaction could have been different had there been greater foresight and preparedness, historian says . It also means that inferences are made by historians on the crisis which should be more qualified .
 RFK’s concern not to underestimate his opponents also led him to instruct officials from the Departments of State and Defense, as well as the CIA, to investigate possible responses to the establishment of a military base in Cuba .
 RFK’s letter to the President and his undaunted exchange with Bundy a month before the crisis, also illustrates his proactive character and confidence . RFK also wrote a letter to Bundy and Bundy in 1961 . The letter also illustrates RFK's proactive character .
 RFK continuously sought to probe issues – to get the facts, to look at all options for handling an issue . RFK continued to seek out all possible options for dealing with issues in the 1960s .
 The President is so confident in RFK’s advice that he is prepared to effectively hand over the meeting to his younger brother . RFK is confident in his brother's advice .
 He then proactively seeks additional advice from him. Reflecting on this counsel, he then seeks further advice from the doctor .
 RFK was already providing the President with unique advice on Cuba-related issues well before the crisis . RFK says RFK had been advising the President on Cuban issues before .
 RFK had at his disposal months of thought and analysis on Cuba-related issues, both his own and others, that he could refer to the President’s benefit throughout the crisis . This meant that RFK was able to use months of analysis and analysis to refer to President�
 Scholars have disagreed about RFK’s role in the decision to blockade Cuba . Scholars disagree on RFK's role in decision to block Cuba from going to Cuba .
 RFK neither claimed to have originated the blockade route, nor did he actually do so . RFK did not claim to be responsible for the blockade, nor to have actually done so .
 RFK’s frank admission (‘not from a deep conviction’) does not diminish the importance of his role – quite the opposite in fact . RFK's frank admission doesn't diminish his role as an important figure in American history .
 It reveals an individual who did not solely view his role as an advisory one, only throwing up alternative options for President Kennedy’s decision or advocating his own approach without recourse to debates with other advisors or other advisors .
 It reads instead as the words of a highly reflective individual, influenced by others but still wary of the chosen option .
 This touches upon both the Chief of Staff and intermediary roles discussed later . This touches on both the chief of staff and the intermediary roles .
 It also shows how the primary source material often marshalled by RFK’s critics can be reconciled with the more flattering contemporaneous accounts .
 Critics say RFK was a dangerous hawk advocating invasion from the outset . Critics say he was a leader of the doves who supported the blockade .
 Whether it wouldn’t be the argument, if you’re going to get into it at all, whether we should just get . into it, and get it over with, and take our losses. Now whether it would be the . argument, whether it wouldn't be
 If he wants to get into a war over this, he sticks those kinds of missiles in after the warning, then he’s gonna get into war over six months from now, or a year from now on something . And if he wants it to come on this thing, he
 RFK’s quote comes from the first day of the crisis, the evening of Tuesday 16th October, at a time when the EXCOMM group was endeavouring to lay out all options and when no sensible participant could yet profess to a final, resolved view .
 McNamara qualified when first outlining the blockade route in that same meeting, ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said .
 RFK’s quote in the round, therefore, it can be seen not as a belligerent exhortation, but a qualified question . RFK's quote is effectively placing invasion on the table as another alternative .
 RFK took a very different approach when directly advocating a position and certainly did so without such qualification . As will be seen later, RFK takes a different approach to advocating for a position .
 RFK helped to broaden the President’s range of alternatives, which was precisely what was required on the first day of the crisis, as all participants continued to reserve final judgment .
 The Chiefs were focused on military efficacies in constructing their invasion plans .
 RFK knew that reducing the invasion lead-time could be a key factor in ensuring the invasion was still a practicable option in the face of world opinion . RFK: "Reducing the invasion leads-time is key to ensuring it is still a feasible option"
 As the meetings progressed, and his support for the blockade route solidified, he also knew that there was a significant likelihood an invasion would be necessary . If the blockade proved ineffectual, he knew there would be an invasion .
 JFK actually explored such a role with RFK after the Bay of Pigs . RFK also explored a role in the White House with JFK in the 1960s . JFK and RFK were both involved in the CIA operation .

 That RFK continued to question this issue, even whilst his support for other courses of action solidified, underscores that neutrality . RFK’s agenda was not departmental, but rather Presidential .
 This was indispensable to the President throughout the crisis, ultimately ensuring its successful resolution by providing the President with an advisor that continued to question and probe and to do so with the President’s interests superseding narrow departmental concerns .
 A further assertion from revisionist critics such as Stern is that RFK’s approach was in ‘sharp contrast to his brother’68.68. RFK was assassinated in 1968 in the wake of the assassination of President Bobby Kennedy .
 On the first day of the crisis, RFK held a Mongoose meeting in the afternoon . RFK was in the midst of a crisis at the time .
 The missile crisis represented an opportunity for RFK’s long-held ambitions to reclaim Cuba from communism, he says . RFK: In this hypothesis, the missile crisis was a chance to reclaim the island nation .
 RFK’s questions in the Mongoose meeting, whilst further underscoring his probing and poking quality, also illustrates that far from these ‘provocative’ questions about an invasion representing a personal agenda, they were informed by a keen understanding of JFK's requirements . RFK
 President Kennedy faced with an air strike option which was far from surgical . The military could not guarantee all missiles would be hit and advised extensive sorties to even get close . A blockade route with highly uncertain outcomes was also a highly uncertain option .
 President Kennedy himself recalled in an interview later that year, ‘whatever action we took had so many disadvantages to it, and each action that we took raised the prospect that it might escalate’72.72.
 The notion of resolving the threat from Cuba altogether, with some form of invasion, was therefore an entirely logical option, particularly when one considers that these Soviet missile emplacements represented the realisation of the administration’s worst fears .
 'Nothing' for 18 months after Bay of Pigs failed to deter the introduction of nuclear weapons . President Kennedy and his brother said it showed that doing ‘nothing’ for the 18 months . after Bay . of Pigs had failed to . deter the invasion of Cuba .
 Prime Minister Harold Macmillan’s initial reaction was to argue that the President ought ‘to seize Cuba and have done with it’
 RFK’s indispensable role ensured that a range of alternatives were brought to the table and fully considered before the Administration acted in such a volatile situation . i. ii. RFK's indispensable role was to ensure that a variety of alternatives could be considered .
 RFK insisted on portraying a tough stance to the Soviets while remaining ‘a force for caution and good sense’ within the White House . RFK's personal contribution to the deliberations was his insistence on portraying the tough stance . As the days progressed, RFK’s personal
 RFK's pursuit of this stance was unique in its energy and resolve but rooted in a keen awareness of the President’s own instincts . As ever, RFK was always committed to the cause of the Vietnam War .
 Few others were able to bridge the hawk/dove divide in this way, and do so in a way which had a pivotal impact on the President, his advisors, and the resolution of the crisis . Few others have been able to do so .
 President Kennedy tasked his brother to convey his resolve to the Russian Premier . JFK was paranoid about appearing weak after Khrushchev's dominating turn at the Vienna Summit of 1961 . JFK’s stance in public also sprang out of a conviction, as the President .
 Measures taken to ready the U.S. military, navy and air force for war were being closely watched by the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union and heightened ‘tension’ in Moscow .
 Khrushchev's memoirs emphasise this aspect when referencing Dobrynin’s meeting with RFK on October 27th, tellingly highlighting ‘that the military men were putting heavy pressure on ’ and extolling RFK for being ‘frank and open
 Bernstein and others have observed that such recollections were published well after the crisis and may not be entirely honest . Bernstein: Such recollections may not have been entirely honest. Bernstein: "Such recollections are published well before the crisis. It's not entirely honest."
 ‘Trick the Jitters in Turkey?’, Political Science Quarterly, 95,1 , 123.1 .
 This sense of impending military action, and pressures behind it, had a profound effect on the Soviet assessment of the situation . The pressures behind the situation had an impact on Soviet assessments of the Soviet response to it .
 A report six months earlier from a GRU officer in Washington, Colonel Georgi Bolshakov, who held repeated back-channel meetings with RFK, reported RFK telling of the power and independence of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 84 .
 RFK’s message carried unique credibility appearing, as it did, consistent with previous RFK/Soviet interactions . The highly personal tone of the delivery of the message was clearly personal . RFK: "It is also clear that this message carries unique credibility"
 Khrushchev's actions had an impact on the crisis, informing the actions he subsequently took to help resolve the crisis . As noted earlier, we also know that this had a significant impact on Khruschev .
 This is another illustration of the uniqueness of RFK’s contribution, given the weight carried to his messages as Presidential brother and intimate, but also his successful delivery of them . RFK's success is an illustration of his unique contribution to his legacy .
 RFK continued to advocate a balanced approach, passionately advocating the blockade route . RFK: "At the same time, in private, he advocated the blockade" RFK was critical of the blockade, but in private he was supportive of the action .
 RFK advocated a ‘combination of the blockade route and the air strike route’ in a decisive meeting on October 20th, arguing for an initial blockade to be followed by an air strike in the event the Russians ‘did not halt the development of the missile capability�
 RFK reiterated this compromise approach the following morning, McCone agreed . RFK agreed to McCone's request that RFK meet with RFK in order to meet with him .
 Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon also attributed RFK for persuading him to drop his support of the air strike . He credited his ‘intense but quiet passion’ and the force of the Pearl Harbor analogy he made .
 Bundy must have been moved in part by a shared language of resolve . Likewise, Bundy must be moved by a common language of resolution . Bundy was moved by the same language as Bundy .
 RFK’s passionate urging of the blockade route must have reassured them of a shared sensibility and like-minded caution, EXCOMM . RFK was a passionate advocate for the 'doves' within EXCOMm .
 RFK represented a ‘middle-way’ figure able to empathise with both blocs, backed with the aura of being the President’s brother, suspected to reflect JFK's own preferred course of action . RFK was the President's brother .
 The strategy was to accept Khrushchev's first proposal while barely acknowledging receipt of the second . The strategy of accepting the first proposal was to be accepted while not acknowledging the second. The second proposal was accepted by the Soviet Union .
 Early historiography extolled the ploy as a clever ruse by RFK94 . Later revisionism has revealed other advisors to have been just as responsible .
 RFK was not the first to touch on the beginnings of this stratagem, says author . RFK had a history of being involved in the assassination of JFK .
 It is here where RFK’s indispensable role becomes clear, for debates on who did or did not conceive the Trollope ploy are a distraction .
 Both men were in the room for the preceding conversation, yet for some reason they still felt it important, in endorsing the Trollope ploy, to qualify it as ‘Bobby’s idea’ – even Bundy, who had technically first broached it .
 First, that whether he conceived the ideas or not, his voice was one that counted – and it invariably became recognised as the predominant one . Whether he conceived or not he was one of the most influential thinkers in the world .
 The second aspect revealed is that RFK’s voice was seen as an influential factor in influencing the President – supporting the view of RFK's essential role as a privileged personal confidant .
 RFK was able to bring to the President through their brotherly intimacy . RFK’s unique value was seen in the unique value RFK brought to the president .
 The nature of the brothers’ family bond is invariably pushed to the margins of studies on the crisis . It is essential in understanding the full extent of RFK’s contribution to the President during the crisis, and why this was indispensable in its successful resolution . RFK's family
 RFK had a unique trust in the President that he simply could not give to other advisors . RFK was one of the most prominent figures in the country's history .
 His legal training was no doubt advantageous, providing those skills of synthesis and advocacy that enabled him to brief his brother in the quick asides they shared throughout the crisis . Some of which we have a record for, others we can only surmise .
 Dean Acheson called EXCOMM a ‘leaderless, inhibited group’107 he unwittingly conferred on this body its most perceptive compliment . The body is a 'leaderless group'
 Many meetings taking place without the President, participants could speak freely and openly, uninhibited .
 The administration avoided tacit consensus that proved so damaging in the Bay of Pigs operation . This helped the administration avoid the tacit consensus . It silenced frank assessments of that plan’s viability .
 RFK became the channel to refer these discussions back to the President . RFK was also the channel for organising organising capabilities, RFK .
 Such a President would have had to rely on memoranda or those departmental leaders that, as we have seen, carried particular objectives .
 As it was, RFK acting as de-facto Chief of Staff he could convey the views of others that did not make the formal record or did so but with insufficient force and needed drawing out . RFK could convey others that didn't make the official record but did so with
 RFK’s use of this capability had an impact on the President. We know that RFK used this capability . RFK's use of the capability had a impact on RFK, says historian .
 Ball was circumspect in advocating the argument among colleagues . RFK was infinitely less so. Ball was fortunate that RFK wasn't so circumspect . Ball was a circumspect.
 It was essential that the administration present a consensus to the world once a decision was made, to present a united front to the Soviets with no weakness to probe and exploit . The U.S. should present a unified front to Soviet Russia, the author says .
 Bundy and Acheson argued forcefully for the strike option in a memorandum for a key EXCOMM meeting on October 19th . Bundy and acheson argue forcefully for a strike option . One can feel this in the highly suggestive memorandum .
 Leonard Meeker, a legal advisor to the State Department during the crisis, wrote a memo . Meeker's memo is another suggestive memo from a legal adviser to the state .
 Historians have criticised Bundy, the closest on paper to this role during the crisis, for failing to adequately prepare JFK for the EXCOMM meetings . Bundy was criticised for not adequately preparing JFK for these meetings .
 JFK eschewed from the outset of his Presidency, in such large and complex meetings this ability of his brother to support his objectives must have been indispensable . Without such support, or the Chief of Staff role, he eschewed .
 JFK was conscious as JFK was that the President must reserve judgment so as not to lead discussions . Yet he also acted as the President’s agent, saying things the President could not . JFK said he would reserve judgment, not lead discussions, but acted as his agent .
 JFK was anxious to ensure one voice from his administration as to how and when the missiles were discovered, and the protocols that were in place to identify this at the earliest opportunity . The question that I’ve heard raised raised rather extensively is why this was not uncovered sooner .
 McCone had given JFK cause to doubt that the administration had done all it could, and that there had been no oversights, so JFK wanted this probed further .
 The President used his brother as an agent for himself, so too did his wider group of advisors, in and out of EXCOMM, and called upon as required .
 Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Averell Harriman, wrote a memo to RFK on the morning of October 20th writing of his own experience of profound Soviet discomfort at the ‘encirclement’ they felt the missiles in Turkey represented . RFK: '
 RFK conveyed a confidential assurance of their removal on behalf of his brother . RFK later assured his brother that they would be removed .
 An additional example came later that evening when the President had essentially made the crucial decision for blockade . The President made the decision to blockade the area .
 Operation Mongoose was the work of McCone, who had built up a close working relationship with the U.S. intelligence community . The two men were involved in Operation Mongooses and McCone was one of them .
 RFK explicitly called for Thompson’s opinion in an October 25th EXCOMM meeting . RFK also called for JFK to follow suit, prodding JFK to do so .
 RFK’s personal files on the crisis, declassified in 2012, hold as many as 3,584 documents directly reviewed by RFK . RFK's personal files hold up to 3,000 documents from his personal files .
 We cannot be sure, but the proactive pursuit of independently corroborated detail is extraordinary and validates Evan Thomas’ assessment . We are happy to confirm that this is true, but we are not sure .
 RFK’s intertwined roles of de-facto Chief of Staff and Agent were indispensable to the President and his successful handling of the crisis . RFK's role was indispensable to President RFK, says historian John Sutter .
 President Johnson’s Tuesday Lunch Group was formed by many of the same advisors as EXCOMM . President Johnson's group was built around a similar idea of frank discussion .
 JFK was keenly aware of these failings throughout his administration, most notably after the failure of the Bay of Pigs . JFK was aware of his administration's failings during his administration .
 Dean Rusk appeared ‘clearly in a state of nervous tension’ in an early crisis meeting with Dobrynin152 . RFK’s adept handling of this channel, balancing indignation and resolve with measured conciliation .
 RFK’s tendency to direct communication and heated exchanges worked well as an effective foil to the national course of action chosen which, while dramatic, was not the military strong-arm it could have been . RFK was not a strong military strongarm, but a strong-armed
 Dobrynin was able to communicate RFK’s offers as the direct voice of the President, including worrying concerns of military pressures on the President . The distinction is surely in Dobrynins being able to .
 Dobrynin believed RFK’s words ‘rather correctly reflected the tense mood inside the White House’, including the idea that there were some, in particular the military, ‘spoiling for a fight'
 Whether conferring privately or during EXCOMM deliberations, the brothers appeared to have empathy with one another .
 RFK made a handwritten note on October 16th, which splits the Hawks and the Doves in two columns, does not list himself . It is telling that RFK did not list his name in the note .
 RFK considered himself apart from the other advisors, an agent of JFK’s objectives . JFK considered RFK apart from other advisors . RFK: "RFK was an agent for JFK's objectives. RFK was not alone"
 In RFK, RFK had someone who had sat with him on a remote Pacific island while close to death . RFK sat with RFK while he was on the island of a remote island while he lay dying . He said RFK was a good man who had a close friend
 RFK made his own objectives subservient to that of his brother . Behind this was that deep fraternal empathy, the shared outlook, and an overriding willingness for RFK to make his own .
 RFK was more attuned to JFK during the crisis than anyone else was . RFK is a great friend of JFK, who was in touch with JFK at the height of the crisis . JFK was JFK's closest ally during his presidency .
 President actively sought brother's advice on the Stennis Committee’s review of the Bay of Pigs Invasion . In a telephone conversation on 2 March 1963, the President sought his brother’�s advice .
 It is likely this was confirmed by previous, privately held discussions . It is not the first time this has been confirmed .
 This confidence was an indispensable support to the President’s burden of decision . This confidence of the President was essential to his decision to take action, the President said .
 Vasili Arkhipov, a senior officer on a Soviet submarine involved in the blockade confrontation, refused permission to launch its nuclear torpedo . He said: "Vasili refused to launch his nuclear torpedo. It was a mistake"
 Consider the outdated Jupiter missiles in Turkey and that they had not been withdrawn earlier, thus providing an ‘escape hatch’ during the crisis . Consider that they provided an 'escape hatch' in the crisis.
 The missiles were detected in mid-October before they were fully operational . It was fortunate, too, that they were detected before they had to be fully operational.
 These, and many other aspects besides, were indispensable factors in the peaceful resolution of the crisis . These, along with other aspects, were essential to the peace settlement of the Syrian conflict, the author says .
 RFK complained at the time and in his memoir on the crisis that earlier directives to remove the Jupiter missiles in Turkey had not been implemented . RFK repeated his brother’s frustrations on the matter .
 Bernstein and others have since observed this to have been ‘foolishly optimistic’ given the timing of such directives and their indirect manner . Bernstein: ‘Foolish optimism’ is now ‘doubting’
 These missiles became fundamental in resolving the crisis – far from being a hindrance, they were a helpful tool . The missiles were a key part of the solution to the crisis in Syria .
 RFK and his brother talked of Khrushchev’s possible responses during the crisis . But they failed to see his need, matching their own, for a modicum of success in any resolution . RFK: "Krushchev's need matched their own"
 RFK should have rejoiced at the usefulness of the RFK's use of the system . Far from bemoaning them, he should have been rejoicing at their usefulness .
 That this did not happen was a testament to both President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev, says President Kennedy . President Kennedy was assassinated in September 1968 .
