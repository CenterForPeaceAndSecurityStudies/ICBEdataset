 The Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba ended disastrously . The U.S. government authorized support for the invasion in 1961 . The invasion was the first of its kind in Cuba .
 Khrushchev secretly moved more than 41,000 troops into Cuba between July and October 1962 . Yet, the problem was real, as was demonstrated all too clearly by the Soviet leader .
 That was a bridge too far for the U.S. and a direct challenge to its young leader, President John F Kennedy . President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 .
 Kennedy consulted with top military brass and advisors and chose what history shows was a wise response . History shows it was wise to quarantine Cuba after Kennedy's decision to do so .
 Diplomats chose that term to avoid the word blockade, which would have amounted to a declaration of war . Diplomats say that term would have been a form of war, but not a declaration .

 Submarine B-59 carried a nuclear-tipped torpedo with about two-thirds the explosive power of the atomic bomb that had been used on Hiroshima . The torpedo was enough to destroy much of the nearby U.S. naval fleet .

 The Deciaration of Arbroath and Brexit ver since the Acts of Union in 1707 brought the kingdoms of Scotland and England together as Great Britain . Scotland has borne a somewhat strained relationship with her more powerful neighbour to the south .
 SNP won 48 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the UK Parliament in December 2019 . The recent general election has emboldened those pressing to leave the UK .
 It takes us back to the ancient origins of the Scottish people and the currently unrecognized familial bonds to the nations around them . The Scottish people have a unique relationship with the nations surrounding them .
 Alexander III of the House of Dunkeld died in 1286 . The Scottish barons invited Edward of England to mediate between opposing contenders to the throne . Edward mediated between Alexander III and Edward III .
 Edward violently coerced the Scots to swear allegiance to him . Instead of swearing allegiance to the king, he coerced them to swear their allegiance .
 Robert the Bruce fought against the English led by Edward II, winning a decisive battle for Scotland at Bannockburn in 1314 . Robert, known as Robert Bruce, subsequently fought against Edward II in Scotland .
 Through repeated letters, the pope sought to end hostilities between the two Catholic countries .
 The Declaration of Arbroath was written to Pope John XXII in Avignon, France, explaining the Scottish position on the conflict with England . He refused to acknowledge Robert the Bruce as Scotland's legitimate king, so the letter was written .
 In 1237, King Alexander II and the barons of his day sent Pope Gregory IX a peace treaty negotiated with England in the presence of a papal legate . The treaty was signed by Alexander II in 1237 and told the pope of their plans to abide by it . The
 Writing to inform the pope of their perception of injustice in 1320 would have been viewed as a potentially fruitful diplomatic approach .
 The Declaration described no sudden swelling of nationalist feeling, but rather a desire for respect and autonomy within the existing relationship with England . The Declaration was published in the 1920s and 1930s . It was intended to be a declaration of independence from England .
 It was a diplomatic letter and a piece of what might be called intelligent propaganda . "Intelligent propaganda," it was written in the diplomatic letter . The letter was signed by the U.S. State Department .
 A 1320 copy of the original resides at the National Archives of Scotland in Edinburgh . The original copy of this article was published in 1320 and is now in Scotland .
 The Declaration of Arbroath laid out the Scots’ historic national credentials . It essentially asked the pope to compel the English to leave them alone . It was essentially a declaration of independence from England .
 There is no evidence that the letter had any significant impact at the time . However, there is also evidence that it had no significant impact .
 It disappeared from history and was virtually forgotten even in Scotland until the English translation of the original Latin appeared in 1689 . The original Latin version of the book was published in 1688 .
 The most famous quote from the letter, sometimes used by Scottish nationalists, reads, “As long as a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be subjected to the lordship of the English.”
 SNP had sought to avoid Brexit and wants another Independence Referendum in Scotland (referred to as ‘IndyRef2’), seeking to separate Scotland from the other UK countries of England, Wales, and Northern lreland .
 If the Declaration of Arbroath were a declaration of Scottish independence, you could see why the SNP might use it . It is not the first time the SNP has used the declaration of independence .
 The party has, however, shied away from referencing the Declaration or even drawing attention to the phrase about freedom, as such references have proved problematic in their earlier campaigns .
 Despite encouraging results for the SNP, a constitutional standoff may not be on the cards . Despite the recent general election, the SNP is unlikely to win the Scottish Parliament .
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already declared that he will not support an IndyRef2 . The first one in 2014 was supposed to settle the issue for at least a generation .

 We know Jacob's name was changed to Israel . The name Jacob refers to northwestern Europe today, including the Scots, English, Welsh, and Northern Irish .
 It seems that the general election vote in Scotland was not necessarily for Scottish independence but rather was against leaving the UK . It seems the vote was against the idea of Scottish independence rather than Scottish independence .
 It remains to be seen how the dynamics will change following the end of the Great Depression .
 After nearly 50 years, the UK intends to control once again its own national destiny, which may be to the advantage of Scotland as well . Scotland is the only country in the world to have its own independent government .

 Americans claiming “no religion” now represent about 23. percent of the population, up from 21. percent in 2016 . Americans claiming "no religion" are sometimes referred to as “nones” because of how they answer the question “what is your religious tradition
 Time magazine's famous April 1966 cover asked ‘Is God Dead?’ It was hardly the first to raise the question or to propose an answer . Time magazine published its famous April cover in 1966 .
 Friedrich Nietzsche had boldly asserted more than 80 years earlier, “God is dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown.”
 Atheism became increasingly fashionable in the twentieth century, as people came to believe that science, not God, would provide their real salvation . Even in our Western world, atheism became increasingly popular .
 In recent decades, science has made amazing new strides in understanding our world . Many of the new understandings support the existence of an intelligent designer, and a human spirit .
 Charles Darwin published his On the Origin of Species in 1859 . The scientific community became increasingly influenced by flora and fauna in the 1800s .
 In 1855, he formulated his own theory of natural selection, and sent to Darwin a short paper on the topic . Darwin sent the paper to discuss the theory of evolution .
 Wallace, however, looking at the same biological questions Darwin considered, came to a different conclusion . Wallace's conclusion was that Darwin was wrong to conclude Darwin's theory of evolution was wrong . Wallace: "Darwin's theory is that evolution is not evolution, it is evolution."
 Wallace: If we saw people making things but weivvtcotinest the construction ots, being looking at the construction of a . DENIED THE INTELLIGENT WORK OF the people and STUDIED ONLY THE THINGS, OTHERS WOULD THINK United States
 Darwin acknowledged that his theory did not account for some natural phenomena that seemed too complex to arise through the incremental mutations and selections his theory required . Darwin was confident that these complexities would eventually be explained . Darwin himself acknowledged that he did not explain some of the complexities he faced .
 Scientists seeking to affirm Darwin’s theory have proposed evolutionary explanations for many complex structures . Evolutionary explanations for complex structures have been proposed since Darwin's theory .
 evolutionary explanations are stuck in the realm of theory, neither reproducible nor falsifiable, and thus are more akin to philosophy than real science . Their explanations, however, like so much of evolutionary theory, are stuck .
 Darwin spent eight years in Indonesia observing the construction of the country's largest buildings . Darwin spent the time observing the movement of materials and not the builders .
 If we saw people making things but denied the intelligent work of the people and studied only the things, others would think us foolish . We would be foolish if we denied people's intelligent work, we would think them foolish, others .
 Biochemist Michael Behe has observed that the science of Darwin’s day had no understanding of the molecular foundation of life .
 The late astronomer Fred Hoyle is famous for one illustration of the improbability of natural selection without intelligent design . Hoyle argues that natural selection is not a matter of evolution, but evolution is a form of evolution .
 He observed that a yeast cell and a jumbo jet have approximately the same number of parts . A yeast cell can be found in the same size of parts as a plane .
 No one would seriously propose that a jumbo jet could spontaneously evolve from its parts . Yet no one would serious propose that such a thing could happen .
 Some propose a “multiverse,” in which our universe exists alongside countless other universes, most of which do not support life as ours does . Most of the universe does not have life as our universe does .
 Most viewed it as a fringe idea, perhaps an interesting intellectual exercise, but certainly not a serious alternative worldview . Most thought of it as an idea, but it was viewed as a serious intellectual exercise .
 Bostrom proposed that unless most human-level civilizations become extinct before they are advanced enough to create computer simulations of persons, the vast majority of those experiencing personhood are doing so as part of a computer simulation .
 He does not eliminate the need for such a Creator; he merely pushes it away by a step . Neither does he eliminate the necessity of such a creator, but he pushes it further .
 The principle of biogenesis states that life can only come from life . Simulations aside, biogenesis is validating by all experiments and experience throughout the history of mankind .
 Scientists know there are intricate mathematical laws that determine the motion and expansion of the universe . Scientists say there are complex laws that explain the universe's motion .
 Scientist Patrick Glynn writes that everything had to be “just right’ from the very start . Everything from the values of fundamental forces like electromagnetism and gravity, to the relative masses of the various subatomic particles, to things like the number of neutrino types
 The laws of physics existed from the very beginning of the universe, scientists say . Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes, the laws of the physics existed .
 Mathematically, it is far beyond improbable that such a universe would randomly come into existence with just the right properties to allow human existence . The universe was created by a universe that has the right conditions to allow humans to exist .
 Many scientists are trapped by the philosophy of materialism and determined to come up with explanations that exclude divine creation . Many scientists have invented fanciful theories to explain complexity around us .
 Intelligent-design theorists point to the “irreducible complexity” of many living structures and processes as evidence that they could not have come about by random mutation and natural selection . By contrast, intelligent design theorists point out the complexity of living structures .
 Evolutionists have offered rebuttals to claims of irreducible complexity in nature . But even the most creative biologist cannot avoid the reality of mathematics . Evolutionists offer rebuttals .
 Evolutionists sometimes accuse creationists of offering a “God of the gaps” explanation . Creationists sometimes say creationists offer an explanation for phenomena that are not yet understood by science .
 Materialist evolutionists are faced with the phenomenon of human consciousness . Evolutionists find many of their assumptions challenged .
 We're doing pretty well in physics, even though we have some puzzling areas, like quantum mechanics . We’re doing well, says Dr. John Defterios . We're going pretty well, he says, but we’ve got a few puzzling areas .
 The philosophy called solipsism proposes that the only reality is in your mind, and that nothing else truly exists . Solipsism is a belief that only reality exists in the mind . The only reality that exists is in the person's mind .
 Scientists like Wallace and Behe propose looking for signs that another mind has acted . One way is to look for signs of another mind acting, they say .
 It’s not the things around us that convince us of others’ intelligence, but the purposeful arrangement of things . It's not things that convince people of others' intelligence, it's the purpose of things, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 The idea that the world around us provides evidence of intelligent design did not originate with sci22 Tomorrow's World, March-April 2020 . The show will feature Wallace and Behe .
 Materialist scientists may think that their minds are illusions, mere byproducts of the “meat” of which their bodies are made . Materialists may think they are illusions . But they are not illusions, they are merely byproducts .
 Animal instinct is an amazing mechanism that lets animals do many incredible things, but they cannot think on the human level . Though animal instinct is amazing, it is not possible to think on a human level, scientists say .
 The qualitative difference between human mind and animal brain is enormous, says Dr. John Sutter . He says the difference between the animal brain and the human mind is enormous . Dr. Sutter: 'The qualitative difference is enormous'
 Animal instinct is often remarkable, but only human beings can conceive of multiple physical dimensions beyond the visible . Only human beings are able to conceive of a range of physical dimensions .
 Physicists use massive instruments such as the Large Hadron Collider to understand physical dimensions beyond our view . Large Hadrons are used to understand the physical dimensions of the universe .
 Evolution cannot explain, and often even denies, the existence of spirit . But the greatest reality is not material existence, but the reality of spirit, it is spirit .
 Scientists make many wonderful discoveries, but their tools can take them only so far . Scientists make discoveries with tools that can only be used to make progress .
 If God has not opened their minds to understand the things of the Spirit, they cannot spiritually discern the full reality of what He is doing here on the earth, they can't .
 Many who puzzle over the physical creation of the universe are missing out on the most astounding aspect of God's creation . God’s Spiritual Creation is God's spiritual creation .
 His very own holy and righteous character, which becomes the character of humble, yielded, genuine Christians . His own holy . character .
 God created finely tuned physical law to form the universe . He has also given spiritual law to help form the character of Christians .
 Jesus gave the two “great commandments” in Matthew 22:36-39 . The commandments magnify the Ten Commandments given in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 . The two commandments are given in the Bible's "great commandments"
 These spiritual laws are just as real as the physical laws that govern the universe . The spiritual laws of the universe are real and real, as are those of us .

 Reason and logic are not the enemies of faith, it is said . It is good to understand the logical and philosophical points we have considered briefly .
 Modern ‘science’ hardly deserves its name, as it does not offer us reproducible experiments that can prove or disprove theories such as evolution and intelligent design . Yet we have seen that much modern “science” hardly deserves that name, says author .
 You can perform one vital experiment on your own and examine the results personally . However, you can do the same thing yourself .
 You can prove God’s existence by living the way of life He has revealed through the Bible and through the Son of God, Jesus Christ . You can live the way God has revealed in the Bible .
 He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to give us an example of godly life and character, and to save us from our sinful nature . And so, He sent us to God to give an example, and save us .

 The Real God March-April 2020 | Tomorrow's World 23 Works of His HANDS . The Brainless Genius of the Sponge . Tomorrow's Real God will be on CNN.com/Heroes 2020 .
 Softness and absorbency make them versatile tools for cleaning our bodies, floors, and dishes, and for applying paint to our walls .
 The sponges we use today are likely to be made of synthetic materials . For most of human history, they were harvested from the dried bodies of aquatic invertebrates . Today, we use them in the form of dried bodies from the oceans .
 Sponges can be found in marine environments throughout the world, from lakes and rivers to vast oceans, and from warm tropical climates to icy polar regions . They are found in lakes, rivers, oceans and warm tropical regions .
 They come in various shapes and sizes, with astoundingly vivid colors and intricate structural architecture . They come from various shapes, sizes, and come from all over the world .
 The underwater equivalent of flowers, their beauty, is truly breathtaking . The underwater world is the underwater equivalent to flowers, and their beauty is breathtaking .
 Unlike most animals, sponges have no external or internal organs or muscles . Sponges don't have internal or external organs or internal muscles .
 Sponges rely on cellular specialization to perform the functions necessary for life . The species of sponges live on the basis of cellular specialization in their cells .
 Others have a more rigid, yet highly flexible, skeletal frame that can withstand powerful ocean currents . Others have more rigid and flexible skeletal frames that withstand powerful currents .
 Cells called sclerocytes secrete calcite or silica strands of varying lengths to form these deceptively delicate 24 Tomorrow's World | March-April 2020 architectural wonders .
 Choanocytes have a funnel-like collar covered with sticky hairs, surrounding a central flagellum . Choanocyte are covered in sticky hairs and have a central, central flagllum around a funnel .
 A sponge’s outer layer contains many tiny pores, which connect to the inner layer to form a complex network of channels through the mesohyl . The outer layer of a sponge contains pores that connect to each other to form channels .
 The flagella of the choanocytes move back and forth in unison, directing the flow of water through the network of canals . The water is flowing through the system .
 The sticky hairs of choanocytes capture particles of organic matter carried in the water . Mobile amebocyte cells engulf and transport these captured bits to other cells within the sponge .
 The filter feeding of sponges has a positive impact on the water quality of marine ecosystems . Sponges have a positive effect on water quality in marine environments .
 As they feed, sponges clean the water by removing harmful bacteria, pesticides, and even heavy metals such as tin and lead . As they eat, they remove harmful bacteria and pesticides from water .
 The sponge stores within itself anything removed from the water that is not consumable as food . Sponges store within itself what is left in the water not being eaten .
 When they separate the individual cells of a live sponge, they find that the cells will reassemble to form one or more smaller sponges .
 The disassociated cells of a sponge can aggregate and reconstruct its entire body . They aggregate and rebuild their entire body in a sponge .
 Sponge cells do not require an assembly order, so a sponge can rapidly regenerate if forcibly separated . Sponge cells don't require assembly order and can regenerate rapidly if separated from each other .
 If two different species of sponge are put through a sieve together, the separated cells will sort themselves and combine only with other cells of the same species . The separated cells of a sponge are able to sort themselves .
 Given a food-rich environment, individual sponge cells could survive simply by reverting to an amoeba-like THE BRAINLESS GENIUS OF THE SPONGE state .
 The cells of these simple animals display knowledge, intent, and the ability to identify other cells as part of the original larger sponge . As they reconstruct the original animal, the cells display knowledge and intent .
 Sponges do this without an apparent means of communication, and despite having neither a brain nor a central nervous system . Amazingly, sponges are able to communicate without any apparent communication .
 Scientists do not fully understand the mechanism by which sponges accomplish all of this . And scientists don't fully understand how they do it .
 Each cell contains the necessary blueprints and instructions, including knowledge of all the specialized cells and cellular functions required for life . Carried somehow within each cell of this “simple” creature are blueprints, instructions and instructions .
 The sponge’s amazing ability to regenerate is even more amazing than its amazing ability .
 Sponge cells— sclerocytes, pinacocytes, choanocytes, amebocytes, and other cells of a sponge—are all totipotent . Sponge cells are totipototent, according to scientists .
 Each sponge cell is similar to a stem cell, able to become a different kind of cell . The sponge cells are similar to stem cells, which are able to turn into different kinds of cells .
 When strong currents damage it, or a hungry fish bites it, a part of it is harvested for a bath scrub, the sponge can heal itself . Any cell near the damaged area can take on the cellular specialization of the injured cells .
 Their form and structure, their ability to clean their ecosystem, and their miraculous ability to regenerate attest to a complexity far beyond human understanding . The form and . structure, ability to . clean their ecosystems, and . their miraculous . ability to regenerate, they say .
 These fantastic creatures are ideally suited to their environment and their role . They are ideal suited to the environment and the role .
 The ingenious perfection on display in the sea sponge cannot be the result of mere chance . The sea sponge is the world's most beautiful sponge sponge .
 It is evidence of a Creator who has planned, designed, and built everything needed to sustain life on this planet . It's evidence of the Creator's design for life on the planet, scientists say .

 A worn-down, frustrated parent can begin to feel like a mindless recording, repeating the same words again and again to a child . A worn down, frustrated parents often feel like they are repeating the words to their children .
 The child can seem not to care or understand why it matters that toys, dishes, or dirty socks are picked up, washed, or put away . And the child doesn't seem to care, even though it's important to put away toys .
 The lessons children learn when we continue to insist and expect that they ‘clean up their mess” will find application in many other areas of their lives . The lessons will also be applied to children in other ways of life .
 For example, teaching children to “clean up their mess’ fosters a sense of responsibility . Teaching children to clean up their own mess fosters responsibility .
 In Genesis, God introduced Adam and Eve to their home in the garden of Eden . Adam and Adam were introduced to their new home in Eden .
 "responsibility is not only a matter of taking care of what is ours. But responsibility is not just a matter, it's also a matter for our children's safety . We need to take responsibility for what we have, not just for ourselves, but for others .
 It also means ensuring that what is ours doesn’t make life worse for people around us . It means ensuring what is yours is not made worse for other people .

 How Practicing Gratitude Can Help Make You Happier, psychologist Robert Emmons says . Emmons writes about the benefit of purposefully and consciously cultivating gratitude .
 Emmons says gratitude is a deeper, more complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in human happiness . Emmons notes that while the emotion seemed simplistic even to him as he began his research .
 This involves the thanksgiving of our previous step, but also more than that that. This involves thanksgiving, and more . This involves a thanksgiving for our previous steps, but it also includes more . We are not only 'thankful' but also "thankful"
 Emmons found that these life changes were not just illusory, but were confirmed by the testimonies of the individuals’ spouses, friends, and families . Emmons: These life changes are confirmed by their spouses, family, friends and family .
 Emmons defined gratitude as acknowledging goodness in our lives and acknowledging the source of that goodness to be outside ourselves . Gratitude must be directed toward someone else, Emmons said .
 He found it all the more important that we practice gratitude for our blessings in times of trial and difficulty . Those blessings may seem hardest to find .
 None of us can pretend that we do not go through hard times. Let God Know . Let God know. None of them can pretend to pretend that they do not experience hard times .
 Of course, we must trust God’s response to our worries, believing that He has the wisdom to see what we do not and the power to act .
 We are to humble ourselves as He gives us His peace, as we remain confident that He will deliver us in His way, in His time .

 In their pursuit of happiness, many never discover the vital truth that happiness cannot be, in and of itself, our goal . Embrace a purpose greater than yourself .
 Cheap and temporary happiness can be ours easily, but the more we seek deep happiness, we cannot find it . The more we directly seek deep satisfaction, the more difficult it is to find it, says CNN.com .
 Something deep within us wants to know that we are connected to something larger than ourselves . Something deep in our hearts is connected to the greater power of God .
 There is a happiness in that connection that isn’t available to us any other way, he says . There is happiness in the connection, he adds. ‘There is happiness there that isn't available to be available to anyone else way.’
 There is no greater effort than to contribute to Jesus Christ’s own effort to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to the world .

 Even when imprisoned and in danger of losing his life, Paul possessed such a steadfast peace and a passionate joy . Paul chose not to defend himself but instead to preach the Gospel . Paul was imprisoned in chains and surrounded by accusers .
 Even imprisoned and in chains, Paul wished he could share with Agrippa the joy he had found in knowing His purpose and contributing to God’s Work .
 When we devote ourselves to service in pursuit of larger goals, happiness comes naturally . Happiness comes naturally, and far more deeply than when we seek it directly as an end unto itself . When we seek happiness, happiness is more important than when it comes to service .
 If you do, you will be on the way to happiness as you have never known it before—for now and for eternity . If you want to be happy, you are on the path to happiness .
