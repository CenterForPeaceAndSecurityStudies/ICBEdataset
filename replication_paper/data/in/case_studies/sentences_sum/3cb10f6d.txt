 With Russian long-range nuclear missiles just 90 miles off the shore of Florida, it is considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war .
 In April 1961, the United States government backed a group of Cuban exiles in an armed attempt to overthrow communist Cuban dictator Fidel Castro . The U.S. government backed the group in the armed attempt .
 The infamous assault, known as the Bay of Pigs invasion, failed miserably . It became a foreign policy black eye for President John F Kennedy . It only widened the growing Cold War diplomatic gap between the United States and the Soviet Union .
 The Kennedy administration in the spring of 1962 planned Operation Mongoose, a complex set of operations to remove Castro from power . Still smarting from the Bay of Pigs failure, the Kennedy administration planned the operation . The operation was part of the CIA and Department of Defense .
 Some of the non-military actions of Operation Mongoose were conducted during 1962 . The Castro regime remained solidly in place during the time .
 In July 1962, Nikita Khrushchev secretly agreed with Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in order to prevent future invasions of the island . The missiles were placed in response to the Bay of Pigs and the presence of American Jupiter ballistic missiles Turkey .
 In August of 1962, U.S. surveillance flights began showing a build-up of Soviet-made conventional weapons on Cuba . Soviet IL–28 bombers capable of carrying nuclear bombs were among the weapons .

 Photographs show sites for storage and launch of ballistic nuclear missiles being built in Cuba . U.S. U–2 high-altitude aircraft flew over Cuba on October 14 to photograph sites .
 These missiles allowed the Soviets to effectively target the majority of the continental United States . The missiles were launched in the early 1950s .
 On October 15, 1962, the pictures from the U-2 flights were delivered to the White House . Within hours the Cuban Missile crisis was underway .
 President Kennedy huddled with his closest advisers to plan a response to the Soviet’s actions . The Cuban ‘Blockade’ or ‘Quarantine’ strategy was the Cuban 'Quarantine' strategy .
 Kennedy’s more hawkish advisers – led by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -argued for an immediate military response including air strikes to destroy missiles before they could be armed . followed by a full-scale military invasion of Cuba .
 Some of Kennedy’s advisers favored a purely diplomatic response including strongly-worded warnings to Castro and Khrushchev . They hoped that would result in the supervised removal of the Soviet missiles and dismantling of the launch sites .
 His Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had suggested a naval blockade of Cuba as a restrained military action . His secretary of defense had suggested that a blockade was possible .
 In delicate diplomacy, every word matters, and the word “blockade” was a problem . The word ‘blockingade’ is a problem, but in delicate diplomacy it matters .
 Kennedy ordered the U.S. Navy to establish and enforce a strict naval “quarantine” of Cuba . The Cuban island nation was under the control of the Cuban government .
 President Kennedy sent a letter to Soviet premier Khrushchev making it clear that further delivery of offensive weapons to Cuba would not be allowed . The same day, President Kennedy wrote that further weapons deliveries to Cuba were not allowed .
 President Kennedy appeared live across all U.S. television networks to inform the nation of the Soviet nuclear threat developing just 90 miles from American shores . Kennedy Informs the American People .
 Kennedy personally condemned Khrushchev for the “clandestine, reckless and provocative threat to world peace” Kennedy personally warned that the United States was prepared to retaliate in kind if any Soviet missiles were launched .
 Kennedy went on to explain his administration’s plan for dealing with the crisis through the naval quarantine . Kennedy explained his administration's plan for the crisis .

 During October 24 and 25, despite Khrushchev's message, some ships bound for Cuba turned back from the United States quarantine line . Some ships turned back because of the message .
 Other ships were stopped and searched by U.S. naval forces but were found not to contain offensive weapons and allowed to sail on for Cuba .
 U.S. reconnaissance flights over Cuba indicated that work on the Soviet missile sites was continuing, with several nearing completion . However, the situation was actually growing more desperate as the situation grew more desperate .
 Joint Chiefs of Staff placed U.S. forces at readiness level DEFCON 2 . The move is an indication that war involving the Strategic Air Command was imminent .
 President Kennedy feared removing the Soviet missiles from Cuba would ultimately require a direct military attack . Kennedy told his advisers that while he intended to allow the naval quarantine and diplomatic efforts more time to work .
 As America held its collective breath, the risky art of atomic diplomacy faced its greatest challenge . America held their collective breath as America faced its biggest challenge .
 Kremlin appeared to soften its stance on October 26 . Khrushchev appeared to be taking a softer stance on the issue .
 ABC News correspondent John Scali informed the White House that a “Soviet agent” had personally suggested to him that Khrushchev might order the missiles removed from Cuba if President Kennedy personally promised not to invade the island .
 President Kennedy received an eerily similar message from Khrushchev himself on the evening of October 26 . The White House was unable to confirm the validity of the offer .
 Khrushchev expressed a desire to avoid the horrors of a nuclear holocaust . In an uncharacteristically long, personal and emotional note, he said he wanted to avoid a nuclear war . In the letter, he expressed his wish for a peaceful solution .
 The next day, October 27, the White House learned that Khrushchev was not exactly that “ready” to end the crisis . The crisis was over and out of the frying pan, but into the fire .
 Khrushchev demanded that any deal to remove Soviet missiles from Cuba had to include the removal of United States Jupiter missiles from Turkey . In a second message to Kennedy, he said the U.S. Jupiter missiles should be removed from Turkey, he also said .
 A U.S. U–2 reconnaissance jet was shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba . The incident occurred on the same day as a U.N. reconnaissance jet shot down .
 The U-2 pilot, U.S. Air Force Major Rudolf Anderson Jr., died in the crash . Major Anderson Jr. was the pilot of the U.2 when it crashed . The pilot was killed by the crash in New York City .
 Khrushchev claimed that the Major Anderson’s plane had been shot down by the ‘Cuban military” on orders issued by Fidel Castro’�s brother Raul . Raul was the leader of the Cuban military .
 President Kennedy had previously stated he would retaliate against Cuban SAM sites if they fired on U.S. planes . He decided not to do so unless there were further incidents .
 Kennedy and his advisors began planning an attack on Cuba to be carried out as soon as possible in order to prevent more nuclear missile sites from becoming operational .
 As this point, President Kennedy still had not responded to either of Khrushchev’s messages .
 In a risky move, President Kennedy decided to ignore Khrushchev's first less demanding message and ignore the second one . President Kennedy chose to ignore the first and the second message .
 Kennedy’s response to Khrushchev suggested a plan for the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba to be overseen by the United Nations . In return for assurances that the United States would not invade Cuba, the U.S. agreed to remove the missiles .
 Kennedy, however, made no mention of the United States missiles in Turkey . Kennedy was speaking at the time of the incident .
 Attorney General Robert Kennedy was secretly meeting with Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Dobrynin . Robert Kennedy's brother, Attorney General, was also meeting with Dobrynins .

 On October 28, 1962, Khrushchev publicly stated that all Soviet missiles would be dismantled and removed from Cuba . Dobrynin related the details of his meeting with Attorney General Kennedy .
 The U.S. naval quarantine continued until November 20, 1962, when the Soviets agreed to remove their IL–28 bombers from Cuba . While the missile crisis was essentially over, the United States continued to quarantine Cuba .
 Jupiter missiles were not removed from Turkey until April 1963 . The U.S. Jupiter missiles remained in Turkey until 1963 .
 The secretive and dangerously confusing nature of vital communications between the two superpowers resulted in the installation of the so-called “Hotline” direct telephone link between the White House and the Kremlin . The world teetered on the brink of nuclear war .
 The "Hotline" still exists in the form of a secure computer link over which messages between the White House and Moscow are exchanged by email . Today, the “Hotline’s” still exists .
 The two superpowers realized they had brought the world to the brink of Armageddon . They began to consider scenarios for ending the nuclear arms race and began working .
