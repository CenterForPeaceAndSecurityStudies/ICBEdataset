 1962 missile crisis was surely the most terrifying event of the Cold War . A Personal and Professional Remembrance Print by Sheldon M Stern .
 President Kennedy’s sober revelation on the evening of October 22, I was so unsettled that I took a long walk through the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts .
 "I thought it might be my last, or at least my last with the city’s infrastructure intact," she says . "It was a great day for the city, but I thought it was my last"
 "I thought I would be able to see incoming, nuclear-tipped Soviet missiles before they detonated. All the while I glanced skyward, believing—incorrectly—that I would ... see incoming missiles," he writes .
 The mere existence of surreptitious Kennedy tapes was not publicly known until 1973 . Nixon's White House taping system forced open the issue of whether other post-war presidents had taped conversations .
 The ExComm tapes alter many presumptions about the most dangerous confrontation of the Cold War . The tapes were recorded in the early 1950s and 1960s .
 I had already gleaned enough from the tapes to know he was dead wrong, but was, of course, prohibited by law from speaking or writing about still-classified material . At that point, he was prohibited from talking about still classified material .
 The tapes were released in 1983 and concluded early in 1997 . The tapes are still being kept in storage .
 These new primary sources have resulted in valuable additions to, and corrections of, the historical record, which previously had a decided Washington tilt to it .
 For the first quarter century after the missile crisis, essentially the only primary evidence had come from U.S. sources . For the past quarter century, there had been no primary evidence from American sources .
 The tapes are the closest thing imaginable to a verbatim record of the crisis . The tapes show the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan .
 In the famous formulation of Leopold van Ranke, the tapes promise the tantalizing prospect of “wie as eigentlich gewesen ist” as it really was .
 Kennedy brothers were the only ExComm participants who knew the meetings were being recorded . JFK and RFK manipulated the discussions to make themselves look good to future historians, it has been charged .
 This intellectual red herring, like the proverbial bad penny, turns up quite regularly . This is not the case, but it's a good thing to say: "It's not a bad penny"
 The ExComm tapes, Safire insisted, “do not present pure, raw history” since JFK knew the tape was rolling and could “turn the meetings into a charade of entrapment—half history-in-the-making, half .
 Perhaps in a recorded phone conversation between two people, it might be possible to manipulate a discussion somewhat to shape its outcome, or otherwise permit a false representation to be made .
 In a meeting of some 15 people, operating under enormous stress, tension, and uncertainty, it would be tactically and physically impossible . It would be impossible to imagine a meeting under such stress and tension, but in a meeting with 15 people .
 JFK could turn the tape machine on and off in the Cabinet Room, but he did not have access to fast-forward, rewind, play, or record buttons . The real-time timer that he would need for selective recording was not available .
 It is clear JFK did not, in his wildest imagination, ever conceive of permitting the public to hear these tapes . It is also manifestly clear that JFK would not have wanted to release the tapes .
 Given the law in 1962, he quite correctly thought of them as his private property . The law was given to him in 1962 and he thought they were his property .
 It was Kennedy’s intention to cherry-pick from the tapes when he wrote his memoirs . He ignored references to classified information and elided personal and political remarks that might be embarrassing .
 The same logic, of course, explains why Richard Nixon incriminated himself despite knowing that his words were being recorded . Safire worked for Richard Nixon, the president of the country .
 Nixon did not attempt to tailor his remarks for the tapes, with one notable exception . Nixon's remarks were made during the FBI’s Watergate investigation .
 Nixon never thought he would or could be compelled to release his personal records . Nixon's personal records were released in the 1970s and '80s .
 If he had believed so early enough, he could easily have destroyed the tapes and all likelihood saved his presidency . The tapes could have saved the president's presidency if he had acted quickly .
 JFK and the other ExComm participants did not know the outcome of the crisis when they were in the middle of dealing with it . The tapes are the most important proof of the tapes’ validity is that JFK and others didn’t know what was going on .
 Historians today would be listening to the same tapes, but with a radically different outlook . Historians would listen to the tapes today with a new perspective .
 The same tapes could now be interpreted to make Kennedy look appallingly weak and negligent rather than diplomatically reasonable, if the outcome had been different . The tapes, in other words, could have been interpreted to have made Kennedy look more likely to have been negligent .
 Robert Kennedy’s posture, as revealed by the tapes, further highlights that the participants could not know what position would seem “right” in the 20/20 vision of hindsight . Robert Kennedy's posture highlights the fact that participants couldn't know what would seem "right"
 RFK knew about the taping system, but he regularly took a hawkish, even reckless, stance . RFK pushed for a tough strategy that would remove Fidel Castro and demonstrate U.S. resolve to Soviets .
 RFK suddenly metamorphosed into a “leading dove” all along . RFK was the subject of an article on the behind-the-scenes decision-making . The Saturday Evening Post published an "exclusive"
 Robert Kennedy painted himself as a dove and conciliator in Thirteen Days . The book was likely to function as his presidential campaign book . Robert Kennedy ran for president in 1968 .
 RFK knew only after the crisis had been resolved that a dovish position was “better” politically, and that having pursued a peaceful solution in 1962 would, in 1968, appeal to a nation divided bitterly by the Vietnam War . RFK: "RFK knew only
 He could not manipulate his image on the tapes any more than his brother, since neither of them knew what was going to happen the next day or even the next hour . Neither of them could manipulate their image any more .
 In and of itself, Thirteen Days is an enormous, if inadvertent, testament to the validity of the tapes as an objective source . In fact, in and of course, Th13 Days is in itself, in fact, the tapes are a testament to their validity .
 Thirteen Days has never been out of print in the nearly 40 years since it was published . The book has undoubtedly been the most influential book on the missile crisis . It has been published more than 40 years after it was first published .
 The book has been the template for several television and film dramatizations of the crisis . RFK’s diary of those 13 days, edited by Theodore Sorensen, was the book of RFK's diary .
 The tapes, however, contradict the book in several fundamental ways, tell a very different story . The tapes tell a different story, one that is much more complex, interesting, and subtle .
 The tapes expose Thirteen Days as not just selective or slanted history, but as the capstone of an effort to embellish, if not manipulate, the history of the missile crisis to Robert Kennedy’s perceived advantage . It is no exaggeration to say that the tapes actually expose
 For the listener with a discerning ear, there was too much that could not be captured or rendered in a transcript, even the most accurate one . For the listeners, there is too much to capture or render in the transcript .
 JFK’s voice and temperament, his impatience, his Cold War convictions, his blind spots, his doubts, his political instincts, his quick mind, his dispassionate self-control, his persistence, his caution, his skepticism about military solutions to political problems, and his
 JFK worked secretly with Rusk to create a fallback plan that would utilize the UN secretary general to broker a settlement in case Moscow hardliners rejected the terms reached late on October 27 by RFK and Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin . JFK and Rusk worked secretly to come up with
 There is nothing on the tapes to suggest that Rusk was indecisive or reluctant to make tough decisions . Rusk had a virtually complete breakdown, mentally and physically, Schlesinger wrote .
 RFK opposed any link between Soviet missiles in Cuba and U.S. missiles in Turkey . RFK strenuously opposed any linkage between Cuba and Turkey missiles in October .
 He was the first to propose a trade of Cuban and Turkish missiles . He stood his ground against harsh criticism from the hawkish majority .
 Stevenson's proposal on October 26 was nearly identical to the one JFK secretly adopted the very next day . It is ironic, of course, that the proposal Stevenson advanced on Oct. 26 was almost identical to JFK's .
 Former Harvard dean was brilliant, abrasive, arrogant, and sometimes seemed to forget that he himself was not the president . But, he was brilliant and abrasive .
 JFK had reiterated that all the missile bases could not be destroyed by air strikes . JFK had just reiterated that . On October 22, JFK had said .
 Khrushchev’s public letter offered to trade Soviet missiles in Cuba for United States missiles in Turkey . On Saturday morning, October 27, the ExComm had just received the letter . The letter was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States .
 Khrushchev’s secret Friday evening offer to remove Cuban missiles in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba . This proposal flatly contradicted Khrushche's secret Friday night offer .
 JFK insisted that ‘most people will regard this as not an unreasonable proposal’ ExComm opposition was almost unanimous . JFK insisted on the proposal, which was rejected by almost unanimous ExComm .
 The deconstruction of the “Trollope ploy” is perhaps the most striking revelation on the tapes . Apart from these insights into the personalities involved, the tapes reveal more about the personalities of the people involved in the project .
 This missile crisis myth, like so many others celebrated by gullible historians, missile crisis participants, and film makers, originated in Alsop and Bartlett’s Saturday Evening Post article, and was later given much greater credence in Thirteen Days .
 The allegedly brilliant tactic dubbed the “Trollope ploy’s” took its name from a plot device frequently employed by Anthony Trollope, a 19th century British author . Trollope was frequently employed in the works by the author .
 Trollope's novels invariably contained a scene in which a marriage-hungry maiden seized upon a man’s casual romantic gesture, choosing to interpret it as a proposal . The novels were often filled with scenes of a woman seeking a marriage .
 In the context of the missile crisis, the notion of borrowing from Trollope was supposedly first suggested by Robert Kennedy . Robert Kennedy is said to have suggested the idea first .
 The attorney general allegedly proposed that President Kennedy respond to Khrushchev’s two separate offers of October 26 and 27 by accepting the earlier message, while ignoring the second . President Kennedy allegedly proposed to ignore the second message .
 Secret tapes prove that the “Trollope ploy” was a cover story from the start . But the secret tapes demonstrate conclusively that the cover story was meant to mask the real terms of the settlement, the author says .
 JFK repeatedly predicted that the Soviet leader would inevitably “come back” to his public offer on the Turkish missiles . Therefore it was foolish and impossible to ignore it. JFK predicted that it would be foolish to ignore the offer .
 JFK's message to Khrushchev did not “ignore” the Soviet premier’s Saturday proposal on Turkey . JFK deliberately left the door open to settling broader international issues once the immediate danger in Cuba had been neutralized . After considerable haggling over the terms, JFK
 Andrew Cordier was to be the secret intermediary between Washington and U Thant . The ploy was real, and it was real . Cordier is named after Cordier, a secret intermediary for the U.S. government .
 U Thant was to propose that the UN oversee the swap of the offensive missiles in Cuba for the U.S. missiles in Turkey . He proposed the swap spontaneously and of his own accord .
 Given the stakes, Kennedy reasoned, the Soviets might accept this neutral third-party, face-saving solution if all else failed . Kennedy reasoned that if the Soviets failed, they might accept a neutral third party solution .
 JFK was determined not to allow any reasonable chance for an accommodation to slip away if the probable alternative was war, and possibly a catastrophic nuclear one . JFK was not prepared to allow a reasonable chance of an accommodation slip away .
 The “Trollope ploy” legend lives on, despite the truth being known . What is surprising, now that the truth is knowable, is how the ‘Trollop ploy’ lives on . It is surprising that now that truth is known, the �
 It has become an unshakable fixture in the lore about the missile crisis, even though it never happened . The missile crisis never happened, but it has become a fixture of the lore .
 Averting ‘The Final Failure’ was published a year after the publication of the book . A production company working on a television documentary about presidential correspondence was contacted by the author .
 The producers were interested in having me discuss Kennedy’s letters during the missile crisis . The producers wanted to talk about Kennedy's letters during that crisis .
 I persuaded them that it would be much more interesting to expose the “Trollope ploy” myth . Instead of exposing the ‘Trollopes’ myth, they decided to expose it to the public .
 The producers, excited about having something genuinely “new” in their program, enthusiastically agreed and interviewed me for some 30 minutes . The producers were excited to have something genuinely "new" in their show .
 When the program aired, my wife and I waited expectantly, and finally, with less than 10 minutes to go in, I appeared on screen for about 4 seconds, as the talking head who introduced the Trollope ploy .
 Martin Sheen, who played RFK in a 1974 dramatization of the missile crisis, was followed by RFK's RFK . Martin Sheen was the first person to attend the event .
 It’s not just television ‘documentaries’ that perpetuate this kind of fiction, it's not just TV "documentaries" that perpetuate it . It's not only television "documentary" but it's also a reality show .
 Talbot claimed RFK “matured from a knee-jerk hawk to a wise and restrained diplomat” during the ExComm meetings . Talbot said RFK was a “wise and restrained” diplomat at the time of his presidency .
 Robert Kennedy, along with McNamara, opposed any terms involving the U.S. missiles in Turkey well into the final hours of “Black Saturday,” so-called because if a deal failed to materialize, a superpower clash seemed imminent and unavoidable . Kennedy and McNamara
 McNamara promoted the false notion that he had been, all along, in the front ranks of those promoting a peaceful resolution of the missile crisis, even if it involved a missile swap . McNamara has shied away from writing a self-serving memoir .
 McNamara invoked the ‘Trollope ploy’ in Morris’s documentary . It's incredible that McNamara even invoked the ploy in the documentary . McNamara's career spanned more than 50 years .
 Either the aging former secretary of defense could not genuinely remember what had happened, or the persistent repetition of the legend had actually displaced the truth in his own mind . Either he can't remember what happened or the truth has been displaced by the legend .
 Before listening to the ExComm tapes, I had taken for granted that John Kennedy was a tough and relentless Cold Warrior . The tapes reveal that he was a "tough and ruthless Cold Warrior"
 JFK and his administration bear significant responsibility for precipitating the missile crisis . Without question, JFK's administration bears responsibility for the crisis .
 Kennedy had approved the Bay of Pigs operation in early 1961 . He aroused Khrushchev’s ire by activating the Jupiter missiles in Turkey . The attack in Turkey raised the prospect of a nuclear attack on Moscow within minutes .
 RFK sanctioned Operation MONGOOSE, which RFK directly oversaw, to sabotage the Cuban economy and overthrow Fidel Castro . RFK was also involved in the operation to sabotage Fidel Castro's Cuba .
 The ExComm tapes prove conclusively that President Kennedy consistently dug in his heels despite the pressure to use force . President Kennedy dug in heels despite pressure exerted by the White House to do so, the tapes show .
 Kennedy stood virtually alone against war-like counsel from the ExComm, Joint Chiefs, and the leaders of Congress during those historic 13 days . Kennedy was virtually alone in the battle against the war .
 JFK consistently rose above the simplistic, black-and-white Cold War rhetoric he had employed in his October 22 address announcing the discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba . JFK's speech prompted me to take a last walk around Cambridge.
 President Kennedy succeeded, but not without some “help” from Khrushchev and some genuine luck . Kennedy succeeded in the war of the Cold War, says historian John Avlon .
 Kennedy never abandoned his commitment to undermine the Cuban regime, even after the missile crisis, to get rid of Fidel Castro . Of course, Kennedy still wanted to undermine Castro .
 Sheldon M Stern is a member of the editorial board of Washington Decoded . Stern served as historian at the John F Kennedy Library from 1977 through 1999 . Stern was historian at Kennedy Library between 1977 and 1999 . He served as a historian for Kennedy .
 Kennedy often complained about how hard it was to decipher the tapes . He was especially irritated because he could not identify the voices of several former colleagues .
 Arthur M Schlesinger, Jr. flatly dismissed the possibility that JFK had secretly taped meetings and telephone conversations . Former Kennedy administration officials flatly dismisses the possibility .

 RFK had worked in Stevenson’s 1956 presidential campaign, but concluded that the candidate was weak and indecisive and voted for Eisenhower . RFK worked for Stevenson in Stevenson's 1956 presidential bid .
 JFK himself had never forgiven Stevenson’s quixotic effort to win a third presidential nomination in 1960 . Stevenson had never been forgiven for his attempt to win the nomination for a third time .
 The antagonism in the room directed toward Stevenson was almost palpable . Stevenson was the subject of much of the debate .
 Stevenson later left the meeting to take a call from the UN in the Oval Office . Stevenson later took a call to the UN from the president .
 He must have experienced mixed emotions as he talked alone in the Oval Office, possibly from the president’s desk . The president's desk may be at the time .

 As Dean Rusk repeatedly stated at the ExComm meetings, Havana’s acceptance of offensive nuclear missiles, especially covertly, furthered Soviet strategic interests but actually threatened the survival of the Cuban revolution . As Rusk said, ‘Hagueys’ accepted the missiles,
