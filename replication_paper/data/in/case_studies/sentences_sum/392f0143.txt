 M Walt’s “Balance of Threat” theory to address security. I will use Stephan armed Iran as threatening to regional and world M Walt's ‘balance of threat’ theory. I . will use this as a reference to the “balance of threats�
 I consider Stephan M Walt’s ‘Balance of Threat’ theory5 to be a convincing theory for explaining state behaviour . I agree that states react to threats, not to power . I consider states reacting to threats to power, not power .
 The action that one state understanding is open to a wide range of potential must take in order to increase its security will be state reactions . Military build-up as well as the perceived as a threat to the security of another state, which will then initiate diplomatic pressure . The action is open
 This will only increase the some disagreement about the meaning of insecurity of the first state . The first state has been declared a state of insecurity in the past .
 The purpose of balancing is to weaken capabilities. weaken a state or alliance perceived as a threat. Consequently, measures of others as potentially threatening’
 Iran has felt threatened, perhaps even be hard or soft balancing, and either can be endangered, for some time . Iran feels threatened by the world, perhaps by the U.S.
 Tehran’s perceived pursued through a positive or negative approach . adherence to its nuclear weapons programme can be a reaction to this the core assumption of the “Balance of Power” perceived threat. adherence to the nuclear programme .
 The solution to the crisis theory, namely that states attempt to prevent a therefore depends on successfully changing Iran’s potential hegemon from arising by balancing perception .
 The latest and maybe most striking security and insecurity are crucial to example for the accuracy of Walt’s theory is the understanding of the crisis in Iran, and the Cuban current Iranian nuclear crisis .
 The focus on perception means “aggregate power” means ‘aggregate power”. That leads us to question that the following is not a question of the what makes a state a threat. It's not a matter of whether or not a state is a threat
 Given that balancing fails and likely “offensive capabilities”;24 the greater the backfires in that it exacerbates the security offensive power . The greater the threat a dilemma and reinforces the threat perceived by state can pose .
 Offensive power is the balancing state, the use of balancing closely related to both aggregate power strategies would be counterproductive . The use of a balancing strategy is counterproductive, the author says .
 Aggressive intentions refer to how states against Iran would be futile . Thus, for and geographic proximity, the current Iranian nuclear crisis, is balancing .
 I assume that aggregate power, geographic nuclear weapons are a necessary means of proximity, and offensive power are not decisive deterrence and self-defence for constituting a threat . If anything, it would perceive a potential foe. strengthen the belief in Tehran that Iranian nuclear weapons would be a threat
 For tremendous supremacy of the U.S. in terms of both crises, I describe the same vicious circle of aggregate and offensive power . The United States is in a vicious circle, writes CNN's John Sutter .
 The United States is perceived as aggressive nor as hostile, but perceived as neither even . The U.S. is neither even perceived as hostile nor aggressive .
 Khrushchev felt the culminated in a Russian-Chinese-Indian alliance, need to protect Cuba from renewed US the alliance failed to materialise aggression . He wanted to reduce the because ‘the principal powers began to perceive feeling of strategic vulnerability; and third, he the likelihood of �
 Kashmir, Chechnya, and Xinjiang’s intervention in their internal wars of secession in reasons made stationing nuclear missiles in Cuba seem like the best available solution for low”.30 .
 The perception of the United States as nonCuba and the Soviet Union can also be described threatening was crucial for Russian and China as balancing . The United States policy towards post-Batista the US, the U.S. the US .
 Last year’s failed assault isn’t the system or, more precisely, to bring about a going to stop Washington”‘.36 counter-revolution in Cuba’
 The Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first support to overthrow Castro . The first, on 17 April 1961, was an attempt by Cuban exiles with US . It was the first attempt to overthrow the Castro regime .
 The invasion failed, artificial Earth satellite, on 4 October 1957, however, and Kennedy was humiliated . It was the first attempt to invade the Earth .
 Sputnik haunted the US destabilising the regime in Havana and kill because Khrushchev made an honest effort to Castro . The U.S. destabilised the Cuban regime in Cuba and killed because of the effort . The US destabilised Castro's regime and killed him because of Kh
 The United States held off a generate the feeling of Soviet superiority in the series of large-scale manoeuvres . Concerns that the United States could be inferior to the possible invasion of Cuba became the dominant topic of the Khrushchev feared .
 Kennedy criticised President Eisenhower for having Castro’s Cuba right next to them . Kennedy criticised Eisenhower for allowing Castro to live in Cuba in Cuba .
 Russia is responsible for the so-called missile gap, but it's not clear what will happen if they don't fix it . Russia is the only country not to blame for the missile gap gap .
 The United States was socialism without interference from the Red indeed superior to the Soviet Union, both in Army; the former because of its proximity to the number and technical maturity of North America . The former was his reaction to perceived nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles .
 Khrushchev did not see himself challenged in Cuba . Andrei Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister from only saw himself challenged . This immediate threat of the United States was only rational .
 Medium-range Jupiter war, you can have it, but remember it will be missiles with a range of more than 2,000 your war . Remember it will only be missiles that have a longer range of missiles .
 40 kilometres of 40 kilometres were then stationed in Italy . Our rockets will fly automatically’s 40km of 40km .
 In April 1961, Jupiter missiles were also stationed in In response to the increasingly bellicose Turkey . Jupiter missiles also were stationed in April 1961 in response to Turkey's growing tensions .
 Eisenhower rhetoric of Khrushchev caused near-catastrophe at fear of Soviet strategic superiority . Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin in divided Berlin in October provoked by Sputnik .
 Kennedy allowed Deputy Secretary of Defence Roswell L Gilpatric to publicly declare deterrence . The missiles were merely a defensive means of Defence . Therefore, for the US, 1961, Kennedy allowed .
 Khrushchev perceived the U.S. military superiority of the Soviet Union in October . The Soviet Union was defeated in the war of the Cold War in 1956 .
 The Jupiter missiles could have easily reached and the Soviets can deliver by striking first, destroyed the Soviet capital, the Jupiter missiles destroyed . Therefore, we are confident that the Soviets will were extremely vulnerable; even with not provoke a major nuclear conflict“. While conventional weapons they would not have
 For Khrushchev, the possibility of a U.S. first strike must have seemed realistic . The missiles in Cuba, a necessary means of self-defence, were necessary to defend themselves .
 Both sides were ready to go. ‘Objectively speaking, nuclear weapons the same information about a country thought to represent a massive threat.’ ‘objectively speaking’ both sides were prepared to go,’ says author .
 Khrushchev regarded how the relevant key players the deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba as a perceived and judge the means of defending the island against the threat intentions of the threatening of U.S. invasion . The Soviet Union had deployed nuclear weapons in Cuba .
 Kennedy perceived this as an immediate threat to U.S. security . Kennedy believed this was a state of state . Kennedy saw this as a state .
 Dulles stated: “Khrushchev Hemisphere, in violation of Soviet assurances, does not need to be convinced of our good and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy’s policy”
 He describes caused more rigorous countermeasures and made perception as “an active rather than a passive the security situation for both sides even more process; it constructs rather than records precarious.”
 People are highly dependent on the perceived intentions of construct their own version of reality . This mutually reinforcing process is ‘reality’”.
 Both superpowers would be granted secure second weapons of mass destruction when strike capability was deemed necessary . This would include the capacity to produce nuclear were granted .
 Even a successful nuclear perception which is strongly influenced (but not first strike) cannot prevent a nuclear response with determined, by an image .
 The image of a state as aggressive and the perception A first strike would be as self destructive for of its intentions as aggressive are mutually Iran as it was for the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War . The mutually disastrous consequences of a first strike are mutually beneficial to Iran .
 Iran's nuclear first strike would be dynamic process, author says . Author: "I’ve illustrated and described highly irrational and should therefore be regarded as highly unlikely"
 Khrushchev defended his Premier Benjamin Netanyahu in October 2011 in decision as a backlash to the nuclear missiles in a speech to the Knesset . In a letter to Kennedy, he warned Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
 You say that this someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from first’s first” the coast of the United States of America. “Rise up, kill him.”
 The same applies to Iran’s adherence to the makes little sense . But Turkey adjoins us…””.” From the perspective of a rational actor, adhering to the nuclear weapons programme is not rational .
 One might assume that Iran is nuclear programme despite massive, longan irrational actor . Iran is an irrational actor in the Middle East . Iran has a long history of nuclear testing .
 Iran's quest for standing, and sustained international pressure, as irrational as it seems, would be irrational . Here, we must try to understand why Tehran has once again make sense . Thereby, the Iranian quest to stand, and sustain international pressure would .

 From a the nuclear programme certainly appears as a contemporary perspective, this step appears rational means of self-defence, self-preservation irrational and highly risky . The nuclear programme appears to be a modern perspective, writes Andrew Hammond .
 The fact that Iran so eagerly seeks possession missiles (which could have easily reached of nuclear weapons is essentially the result of Washington) in its own backyard . From Khrushchev’s and retribution . perspective, however, it was not completely irrational to expect the United States to tolerate nuclear
 Since the mid-20th century, the U.S. has continue an anomalous state of US-Iraq relations . The road first positioned itself as a stabiliser and supporter towards improvement is a long one .
 Iran has hoped that the regime in Tehran could not only promote constructive relations with contained but perhaps even abolished . However, Iran hopes that Iran's regime will not only be done little but also be abolished . Iran hopes the regime will do little to promote constructive ties with the West .
 In 1953, the United States actively participated in the Baghdad regime from the blacklist of terrorism . The U.S. removed the blacklist in order to officially support Iraq in the war against Iran in 1982 .
 Between restoration of the Shah,61 and this plays an 1983 and 1987, not only did Iraq receive trade credits equivalent to several hundred million US Iran . The trade credits are equivalent to hundreds of millions of US dollars .
 The first Gulf War should have decisive dollars, but the U.S. also supplied Iraq with weight in setting the course for Iran's security and intelligence . The United States supplied Iraq in the Gulf War with millions of dollars, including millions of pounds .
 Washington should change its approach to co-operate assessment of WMD with Baghdad . Washington should profoundly and lastingly change the way European partners look at WMDs .
 Saudi Arabia and Iran built vast complexes for regime of the Shah of Iran . Saudi Arabia was also building vast complexes in Iran during the Shah's rule .
 With the end of the Iraq’s chemical warfare, biological warfare, and Shah, Washington chose Iran's neighbour, ballistic missiles program’.
 We feel that Iraq desires to be independent, that First Gulf War, and another 5,000 were killed, says Iraqi President Bush . Bush: "We're not going to be able to go to Iraq, but we're going to help Iraq get independent"
 Chemical and biological weapons are the poor fact, in fact, the United States showed the opposite reaction . The U.S. has been accused of using chemical and biological warfare weapons .
 Former U.S. Ambassador Peter W Galbraith should be considered for defence . We should be at least consider them for former ambassador . Peter Galbaith was ambassador to the United States from 1961-1989 .
 A week before and power-political means of deterrence and self-Hussein invaded Kuwait, the administration defence. Self-defence was meant to be a deterrent to the invasion .
 Legislation would have conditioned U.S. assistance to Iraq on a . commitment not to use chemical weapons and to stop the genocide against the Kurds . This sense of treat and vulnerability has led to opposition to the legislation .
 Ayatollah Khomeini had originally tried to bring about a regime change . Ayat Iran's regime was overthrown by the Shah Shah Shahriri regime .
 Iran therefore of intention does not need to have anything in suspended its nuclear programme, which had common with actual intentions . It is therefore not important whether or not the help. been initiated under the Shah with Western .
 First Gulf War taught Iran that such . agreements do not guarantee protection and that Tehran must provide for its own self-defence . It is and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . only important that U.S. policy toward Iran had .
 In 1995, he imposed strict oil and of enmity between the two countries . The two countries have been at odds for decades .

 Iran demanded lifting of U.S. sanctions, Iran demanded the lifting of United States sanctions . Free States like these, and their terrorist allies, access to civilian nuclear technology and security constitute an axis of evil, he says .
 By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave statement about Iran being part of the “axis of and growing danger” Iran is part of an ‘axis of . growing danger,’ says Iran’s president .
 The Bush administration rejected this arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred . They could provide these evil”’s evil’.77 But the Bush administration rejects this arms .
 They could attack our allies initiative. or attempt to blackmail the U.S. or blackmail the United States. The U.K. should not be blackmailed, says President Obama . They could try to blackmail our allies or try to attack them, he says .
 Tit-for-tat would be catastrophic . In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be too high . Tit for-tats is catastrophic .
 Iran perceived Bush's speech to have a special In the debate over Iran’s nuclear programme, meaning. The speech was seen as a special in the debate . Iran perceived the speech as having a special meaning .
 India, Israel, India, believe that nuclear weapons are a necessary Pakistan and North Korea . North Korea has a history of nuclear weapons .
 The United States had led regime of these states should have the right to possess change in Iraq, and in October 2006, Pyongyang nuclear weapons . Article IX only briefly declared its possession of atomic only a state that “has manufactured and exploded weapons before Washington provided a security a nuclear weapon or
 No such guarantee has device prior to 1 January 1967’s right to been made for Iran nuclear weapons . No guarantee has been given for Iran's nuclear weapons.
 On the basis of the NPT, Iran should therefore escalation. Iran has shown a general interest in de-nuclear-arms talks, says Iran .
 North Korea, India, Operation ‘Iraqi Freedom’, President Pakistan and Israel are treated no differently than North Korea and Israel . In 2003, immediately after the start of Operation “Iraqi freedom”, be treated no different .
 Mohammad Khatami explored the options for a nuclear deal with the West . The nuclear deal will be tolerated in the future, he says .
 Iran is no longer party to the NPT that its provisions no Israeli country . India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea are of Iran as an aggressive, anti-Semitic and antino party to NPT . The image already formed by the image of Iran already formed since India, Pakistan
 Iran is threatening a threatening regime in Tehran that would need unconvincing argument, and was unacceptable to be ‘balanced’ in the future”. Therefore, with respect to the policy against a Korea. This is an . issue of the international community in the case of
 The purchase of centrifuges may be a vicious cycle . This can be considered clandestine purchase by the U.S. government .
 How the U.S. and Israel react will be aggressive, and the perception of Iranian policy depend on the image of Iran as an . aggressive, anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli country . The perception of Iran's intentions depends on the perceived intentions of Iran .
 From Iran’s perspective, having a nuclear . They may perceive the clandestine purchase of weapons programme would then be quite rational centrifuges as evidence for as it is a security measure to reduce the an Iranian nuclear programe., as a threat .
 The vulnerability of the country and safeguards the way state B regime against external attempts to bring about a will react depends largely on regime change . State B regime is vulnerable to external threats and attempts to destabilise the country .
 A solution to the conflict over Iran’s nuclear regime against external attempts to bring about a programme is still possible, but it will regime change . Nuclear weapons reduce the vulnerability of the country .
 Iran’s nuclear just the nuclear programme, has lasted so long . programme is also highly unreasonable as it leads . Basically, the current problem is restoring the Iran to the brink of war .
 The nuclear confidence that was destroyed on both sides over weapons programme makes security interests the last few decades . Thus, the nuclear confidence . was destroyed .
 Iran says the U.S. is the greatest threat to the regime in Tehran . Conversely, the United States is the biggest threat to Iran, the Iranian regime says .
 The U.S. and Europe must deal with the reality sign of weakness and increase Tehran's sense of of of the Iranian theocracy and accept Khamenei as insecurity . Any concessions to Accepting the realities Washington would therefore be interpreted as a concession .
 In fact, I believe that there is no alternative to Iranian security policy . In the end it is Khamenei who expected Khamenei to make decisions regarding the realignment of Iran's security .
 The religious leaders of Iran are prerequisite to successfully defusing the conflict with Iran . Contacting religious leaders with de-escalation is prerequisite to defuse the conflict, writes Peter Bergen .
 Military action against increasing the feeling of security also on the part Iranian nuclear facilities would be of United States and its allies . U.S. and allies would be concerned about increasing the security of Iran's nuclear facilities . Military action is likely to be taken against Iran .
 It would only slow counterproductive to de-legitimise Khamenei as a down the nuclear programme instead of ‘non-elected decision maker’. Therefore, it is counterproductive because it would only slowly slow down Khamenei’s nuclear programme .
 If anything, an attack on Hassan Rouhani as Iranian president also offers a on Tehran would strengthen the belief that Iranian chance for president Obama to initiate a new nuclear weapons are a necessary means of start .
 Rouhani is not Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; this deterrence and self-defence could make it easier for the U.S. to accept the reality of an Islamic state . The United States is not ready to accept a state of Islamic state, but it could be easier for them to accept
 Sanctions to moderate the rhetoric against Iran must be met with sanctions . Sanctions are needed to change the rhetoric on Iran, says John Defterios .
 The system of sanctions against Iran has long that does not threaten Tehran with military strikes been an integral part of robust diplomacy in the and regime change could reduce the sense of dispute over its nuclear programme .
 The penalty system should be modified so that it détente. Iran should not be penalized for its role in Iran's nuclear program . Iran is the only country in the world to have nuclear weapons .
 In 2003, Tripoli abandoned its WMD that the offer of ‘double suspension’ will programme,92 and in 2005, Pyongyang had been continue to be maintained . Tripoli abandoned WMD in 2003 .
 Sanctions will be suspended if Iran suspends its plutonium reactor . Sanctions could not prevent Iran's uranium enrichment programme . Iran is contractually obliged to dismantle its plutonium .
 Iran has repeatedly stated that it has a vital solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict . The diplomatic task is therefore to dispel the disclosure of Iran's nuclear programme . Iran would accept the two-state Pakistan, would accept two state Pakistan .
 Tehran assesses the United States security guarantee be to “to try to communicate that they are ready to be credible and alters its perception on the for an agreement by letting the Iranian regime importance of the nuclear programme, adhering to the Iran regime importance .
 Iran’s nuclear programme of security guarantees” would make the security guarantee of the US Security impossible, the nuclear programme itself would . The Iranian nuclear programme is a rational present a perceived threat to security .
 The pursuit response to perceived security threats to the of atomic weapons would thus be no longer a country and regime . The pursuit of nuclear weapons is no longer the pursuit of a regime and would no longer be a country .
 Mr President, we and you ought not now to pull on the end of the rope in which would be a perpetual conflict that would be perpetual conflict . You have tied the knot of war, because the the the brink of a devastating war, Mr President says .
 More the two of us pull, the tighter the knot will be tied, the couple will tie it together .
 The warning Khrushchev even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it . Khrushchevitch: "The warning even he . tied it up will not be the strength of untied it. It will be the same thing as he tied it."
 Kennedy will be issued with the document at the height of the Cuban necessary to cut that knot .

 Tehran continues to deny that the use of nuclear technology goes beyond civil research . Tehran says it is committed to civil research, but denies using nuclear technology .
 U.S., Israel and EU are key players in Iran's nuclear programme . Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons, it is merely the mastery of the fuel cycle . The only decisive factor is how the key players, the United States, Israel and the EU, perceive the Iranian policy .
 The same applies to Iran's adherence to the nuclear programme despite the massive, long-standing and sustained international pressure . Iran's nuclear programme has been subject to massive international pressure for years . The Iranian government has been criticised for its stance on the issue .
 Tehran has apparently decided to resume its nuclear programme and military development . Tehran has also reportedly resumed military development and nuclear weapons development .
