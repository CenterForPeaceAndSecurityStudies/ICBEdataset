 USSR was viewed as an aggressive power intent on world hegemony, disdainful of U.S. political will, and recklessly determined to gain a fundamental psychological advantage over its chief adversary . In large part, the USSR was seen as an aggressor intent on global hegemony .
 The weight of evidence now indicates that Khrushchev's motives, shrouded in uncertainty, are now clear . Far more than any of the other momentous occurrences of the twenChinese and Indians, point to a basic misinterpretation .
 The charter of the Danforth Commisthough charter was profoundly misguided . The charter was directed by the president and confirmed by a Joint Resolution of arate sets of concerns .

 The introduction of missiles into Cuba would be intertical weapons, which might be activated by the commander on the ground or at sea by his own authority . Unfortunately, no parallel regulation was extended to the tacized that the introduction of these missiles into the Cuba would not be inter-technical weapons
