 Sergei Khrushchev told some Americans he had been urged by Fidel Castro to launch nuclear missiles on U.S. cities in 1962 . Some Americans- so they thought- that Fidel Castro had urged his father to launch missiles .
 The younger Khrushchev and Soviet officials denied that he had told the Americans any such thing, leaving confusion as to whether Mr Castro actually had called for use of the missiles .

 Americans in Moscow said President John F Kennedy never took Mongoose seriously seriously . Americans in Russia say President Kennedy was never serious about Mongoose .
 Khrushchev turned him down in a hurry . But if Mr Castro did urge the Soviet leader to shower nuclear missiles on U.S. cities, he was turned down . Mr Castro was the leader of the Soviet Union .
 Despite much Khrushchev bluster-the Soviet Union was producing rockets ""like sausages that come out of an automatic machine""-he knew that Moscow actually lagged far behind the United States in nuclear weapons .
 Despite Kennedy's 1960 campaign against the ""missile gap,"" the U.S. knew it, too . The United States knew it too .
 Khrushchev knew that a missile launch from Cuba-he had only 20 nuclear warheads there-would be suicidal for the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union knew that such a launch would be suicidal .

 Fidel Castro sent a message to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the height of the crisis urging him to fire nuclear missiles based on the island in anticipation of a U.S. attack . The move almost certainly would have triggered massive United States retaliation against the Soviet Union .
 According to one account, Khrushchev agreed to U.S. demands that the missiles be withdrawn . The message convinced him that the confrontation had gone too far . The Soviet leader agreed to the United States' demands .
 Soviets taking part in the conference said the United States cities were targeted for attack by the Cuban-based Soviet missiles . At least half of the 42 missiles deployed on the island were operational with nuclear warheads .
 Cuban officials refused to confirm the report of Castro's message to Khrushchev . The message was conveyed to United States participants privately and did not form part of the conference record .

 Volkogonov said that it would have taken four to five hours to make the missiles ready for launching . He said it took an additional 15 minutes to fire them . Volkogsonov: It would have been more than four hours to prepare for launch .
 Khrushchev said that although the warheads were in Cuba, they were not actually mounted on the missiles . Khrushchevsvsvs: "The warheads were actually in Cuba but not in Cuba" Heavily-armed Soviet Union says it was a mistake .

 We may, this time, choose to initiate a preemptive strike against a nation that we believe to harbor weapons of mass destruction . The U.S. could launch a strike against such a nation, President Obama says .
 No one can predict the true effects of such a decision, it would be wise for our current government officials to take a closer look at Kennedy's actions in 1962 .
 Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. recently spoke in a panel discussion at the JFK Library and Museum in Boston . The panel discussion was held in honor of the JFK Museum .
 He compared the events of October 1962 to today, saying, "There were people in favor of a preventative war during the Cold War and they were regarded as a bunch of loonies"
