 An inquiry illuminated a mostly hidden effort by the Brazilian government of President João Goulart to mediate, at Washington’s behest, between the U.S. and Cuba at the height of the crisis . The inquiry looked at declassified sources from the archives of various countries
 Goulart sent a personal emissary (his military aide, General Albino Silva) to Havana to deliver to Fidel Castro a proposal (secretly approved by Washington) to resolve the U.S.-Cuba conflict . The missile crisis mediation bid culminated three years of quiet Brazilian
 In October 1962, amid superpower brinkmanship, the episode was barely noticed and was shrouded in secrecy . John F Kennedy and his specially formed Executive Committee were involved in the matter . The episode barely noticed in October 1962 .
 The attempted mediation was rendered moot by Khrushchev’s decision to withdraw Soviet missiles from Cuba . The day before Goulart met Castro, the day before the meeting, the Soviet missiles were withdrawn from Cuba, were withdrawn .
 Probe can shed light on Kennedy’s handling of the crisis and add a new twist to its international dynamics . Yet, probing the event decades later may shed light .
 Declassified Soviet documents were used for my earlier article . The Soviet ambassador's record of a 31 October 1962 conversation with Castro about the Brazilian envoy’s visit 1.5 years ago .
 The Soviet records suggest that in conversations with Moscow’s envoy, Goulart seemed significantly more sympathetic to Khrushchev and Kremlin foreign policy than in his concurrent conversations with Washington's ambassador, when he ebulliently praised Kennedy's conduct . The records also suggest that Goul
 The Brazilian leader’s attempt to perform a complex balancing act between the superpowers—with mixed results . They thus illuminate the Brazilian leader's attempt to balance between superpowers .
 Before examining events in the fall of 1962, a review of prior SovietBrazilian ties provides necessary context . The Soviet-Brazilian relations between 1962 and 1962 provide necessary context.
 In the 1930s, under Getúlio Vargas, security forces harshly cracked down on leftist forces .
 Vargas established the dictatorial, fiercely anti-Communist Estado Novo with sharply increased power . Vargas openly sympathized with fascist powers even while preserving vital economic links with the 2.2 billion-strong Estado .
 A vast biographical literature on Goulart exists, though it does not use Soviet archives . A vast Brazilian biographical work exists, but it is not published in Soviet archives.
 When Brazil joined World War II on the Allied side, its opposition to the Axis fostered improved links with the USSR . The Soviet Union unexpectedly resisted the German onslaught and Iosif Stalin disbanded the Comintern .
 Cold War tensions rose between Washington and Moscow . Yet strains also grew between Moscow and Rio, as tensions grew between the two countries .
 In late 1947, President Eurico Gaspar Dutra’s government severed Soviet-Brazilian relations . Such actions firmly aligned Brazil with the United States .
 By the late 1950s, Latin American countries felt neglected by Washington . Washington had devoted most of its Cold War attentions (and dollars) to countering Communism in Europe and East Asia .
 Kubitschek warily explored increasing commerce with the Soviet Union . He wanted to complement Brazil’s diplomatic ties with two Soviet allies, Poland and Czechoslovakia . At the same time, facing financial travails, he was facing financial problems .
 Kubitschek’s cautious step toward trade with the USSR marked a partial victory for Moscow . Moscow's move to trade with Russia was a cautious move toward Moscow .
 The offending article, “Hitler Rewarded Him,” appeared in the 4 October 1947 issue of Literaturnaya Gazeta .
 Mexico contributed to the struggle against Japan by sending a fighter squadron to the Pacific late in the war . Mexico sent a squadron of fighter planes to fight in the Pacific .
 Quadros made a bid for leftist voters in the upcoming presidential race by warmly endorsing a renewal of Brazilian diplomatic relations with Moscow . Quadros, the former São Paulo mayor and governor, was known as an economic conservative . During a summer 1959 trip to the Soviet Union he made a
 Quadros/Goulart ticket elected in October 1960 to succeed Kubitschek . Goulart visited Moscow and Leningrad in December expressing hope for the rapid establishment of good Soviet-Brazilian relations .
 Soviet documents show Goulart had long talks with Prestes and with Cuban National Bank President Ernesto Guevara . During the visit, documents show, Soviet documents reveal, Goullart had talks with both Prestes, Prestes . The visit happened 8.8.
 Goulart reportedly told associates that Castro’s victory in Cuba was “very important both for the Soviet Union and for the peoples of Latin America, for whom Cuba is a living, illustrative and infectious example,” he told associates .
 Goulart claimed to be more eager than the incoming president to restore bilateral relations with the USSR . He was hoping for a personal meeting with Khrushchev . Soviet officials had a guarded assessment .
 Goulart’s vows to “speed up the process of normalizing relations” remained vague, they noted, and his trip “had the character of a probe and was partly dictated by the desire to raise his personal prestige” and to neutralize Quadros
 Quadros vowed to pursue an ‘independent’ foreign policy that would feature outreach to the Communist world . Quadros: "Independent’s not U.S.-dominated" foreign policy would include outreach to Communist world.
 While outwardly aimed at increasing commerce, the new policy direction had obvious political implications that irritated and alarmed Washington . Washington.
 Khrushchev worked o renew ties with Brazil, sensing a chance to expand Soviet influence in the hemisphere beyond the Cuban foothold . He worked to renew relations with Brazil .
 Quadros sent special emissaries to Eastern Europe to lay the groundwork for new diplomatic relations with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania . Quadros also established economic and political ties with East 11 .
 B Tokmakov, Report on Goulart Visit, 19 December 1960, in F 7523, Op.8, D 228, Ll.8 and Ll. B . Report was published in 1960s .
 Quadros’s envoy told Khrushchev that the Brazilian president had entrusted him with a secret mission to pave the way to restore normal Brazilian-Soviet diplomatic links . Quadros was in Moscow ostensibly in Moscow only to spur trade .
 The Soviet leader eagerly agreed, dangling the prospect of substantial Soviet economic aid . Soviet leader was dangling the possibility of substantial economic aid from the West .
 In the summer of 1961, Moscow sent an economic mission, a “goodwill” delegation, and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to Brazil . The mission was accompanied by a "goodwill" delegation .
 Quadros resigned suddenly and mysteriously on 25 August, before formally renewing Soviet-Brazilian relations . Quadros then resigned suddenly, mysteriously, before renewing relations with Brazil .
 Goulart named as Brazil’s ambassador Vasco T Leitão da Cunha, a respected senior diplomat . Five months earlier he quit his post as the number two in the foreign ministry in a spat with Quadros over a presidential envoy's visit to East Berlin .
 da Cunha was Brazil’s ambassador in Havana during the Cuban revolution . Before that, he was Brazil's ambassador in Cuba during the revolution .
 He had initially sympathized with the anti-Batista revolt but after a short honeymoon with the barbudos grew disillusioned with Castro’s rule, to the point where he saw it as a Soviet-aligned menace .
 U.S. officials watched the Brazilian-Soviet rapprochement with concern . They warned Brazil that the Soviet Union might exploit any diplomatic presence in Brazil to promote espionage .
 The paper was presented at the “New Perspectives on Latin America’s Cold War” panel during the International Studies Association / Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales Conference, Buenos Aires, 23 July 2014 .
 Czechoslovakia used its embassy in Rio to engage in espionage operations and promote Soviet and Communist objectives . Brazil retained diplomatic relations with Brazil, but used its diplomatic relations to engage espionage operations .
 Khrushchev praised Goulart’s potential and pledged Soviet support for its development . He suggested expanded bilateral commerce could reduce Brazil's dependence on the United States .
 He also discussed building a hydroelectric plant or subway in Brazil . After receiving the congratulations on the latest Soviet space feat, he congratulated Brazil .
 Soviet-Brazilian discussions of the possibility that Moscow might bankroll massive construction projects reflected the two countries’ shared belief, at that juncture of the Cold War, in economic development, especially in the Third World .
 His appointment by Khrushchev was preceded by a visit to the country by the Soviet leader’s son-in-law . Izvestiya editor Aleksei Adzhubei visited the country in 1960s .
 Chernyshev's instructions included preparing for a major Soviet industry, culture, and science fair in Rio de Janeiro . The fair would be Moscow’s largest ever in Latin America, attended by an estimated half million people .
 Another task was to support Brazilian resistance to U.S. anti-Cuban prodding . The Soviet Union also pursued covertly .
 KGB agents based at the Rio embassy joined and soon took over, a Czechoslovak intelligence operation to enhance Havana’s status and the broader cause of revolution in Brazil . The operation was part of a Prague-based intelligence operation .
 Goulart said he ardently sought greater economic links with the Soviet Union . He said Russia feared and discouraged them, hoping to worsen their relationship .
 Both agreed to develop ties warily, to avoid provoking anti-Communist forces . Both agreed that they should develop ties with each other warily . The two countries agreed to be wary of each other .
 Chernyshev spent much of his first months in office promoting the Rio exhibition and a bilateral trade deal signed by a visiting minister . He had told a Polish colleague he would not be “overly active”
 Despite this caution, the new Soviet ambassador and his aides, while taking “necessary precautions,” also quietly but repeatedly conferred with top Brazilian Communists, including Prestes, despite the PCB’s formally illegal status . Prestes: The new Soviet envoy and aides took “
 Kraenski and Petrilák, 1964, ch. ch.; and Pelant, “Czechoslovakia and Brazil, 1945–1989,” 101 .
 The trade accord (providing for turnover up to $100 million in 1962) was signed on 7 May 1962 by Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai Patolitchev and Dantas .
 Chernyshev relayed friendly messages from Khrushchev, sought Goulart’s support on nuclear issues . He also tried to firm up Brazilian defiance of United States pressure to take a hard line against Cuba .
 Through various means, the embassy labored to counter Brazilian ‘reactionary circles’ opposed to Goulart’s foreign policy, especially his friendliness toward Havana and Moscow . The embassy worked through various means to counter those opposed .
 Khrushchev raised the idea of Moscow launching a large-scale construction effort in Brazil . The Kremlin may send shipments of wheat or oil, greater technical cooperation, and a possible visit by the former Soviet leader .
 Goulart said he would put his military aide, General Silva, in charge of negotiating a new five-year bilateral trade pact . The pact was signed in 1959, replacing a previous one signed by the South Korean president .
 Goulart vowed that Brazil would not alter its stand against interference in Cuba . Brazil will not change its stance against interference there, despite 33 other countries' interference .
 Chernyshev: U.S. risked provoking World War III if it committed or backed aggression against Cuba . TASS has warned against any attack on Cuba, noting a recent TASS warning against such an attack .
 Latin American foreign ministers met in Washington, DC, at United States urging, to consider the Cuba problem . United States Defense Department was stepping up contingency planning for potential action against Havana . The Soviet Union was secretly deploying in Cuba mediumand intermediate-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads .
 U.S. reconnaissance plane photographed missile sites under construction in Cuba . U-2 reconnaissance plane captured missile sites in Cuba on 14 October .
 The crisis flared into public view at a moment of turmoil for the Soviet embassy in Brazil . The embassy was in the midst of a crisis at the time .
 On 21 October, the day before Kennedy announced that Moscow was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, Chernyshev drowned while swimming off Barra 36 .
 The 50-year old ambassador died before emergency medical first aid could be given . The 44-year-old chargé d’affaires, Andrei A Fomin, is now acting ambassador .
 President Goulart, Premier Hermes Lima and other Brazilian officials and dignitaries visited the Soviet embassy to pay respects and express condolences on behalf of Brazil .
 For the first few days after Kennedy’s speech that evening, Brazil's leaders eschewed substantive conversation with Soviet diplomats . This may be because of disarray at the embassy, the lack of any particular reason or need to consult with Moscow's representative .
 The most crucial Soviet influence on Brazilian conduct during the crisis resulted from a talk in Moscow between Brazil’s ambassador and a senior Soviet official . Brazil's ambassador and Soviet official were at the center of the crisis .
 There is no evidence that Leitão da Cunha had any such highlevel contacts with Soviet officials during the crisis .
 In fact, he was engaged in a minor dispute with them, over an Izvestiya article the month before, on the occasion of Brazil’s national independence day . He believed stated that “American companies” determined the actions and statements of Brazilian politicians and diplomats .
 The Brazilian envoy had written to the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, Adzhubei, protesting the article . The article was published hours before Kennedy spoke in Washington . Izvestiya editors denied that the article had contained any disparaging remarks .
 Rumors circulated that the ambassador had been killed in an inside job, with one of his underlings giving him a poison that caused him to collapse while swimming . The ambassador collapsed while swimming in a pool .
 Moscow made no claim of foul play, and an internal Soviet report on the drownings did not insinuate anything other than an accident . However, Moscow did not claim foul play and said the drowning was accidental .
 Da Cunha diplomatically conceded that his objections may, in part, have stemmed from a misunderstanding, and the contretemps was smoothed over . The former president of Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state-run government has been criticized for his remarks .
 Frol Kozlov, a senior Khrushchev deputy and member of the CPSU Presidium, met Leitão da Cunha shortly before the crisis erupted . Kozlov was a senior CPSU deputy .
 Kozlov apparently indicated that Moscow could support a proposal to create a nuclear weaponsfree zone in Latin America . Brazil’s UN delegate presented a proposal in a speech on 20 September to the General Assembly . Kozlov indicated that Russia could support the proposal .
 Lima checked by telegram directly with da Cunha, who on 25 October suggested pushing the proposal 43 . Lima checked the proposal with the Portuguese president .
 In early November, Brazil’s ambassador in Warsaw reported that the Poles favored the Latin America NWFZ plan . The plan was approved by the Polish government in November .
 The Brazilian NWFZ scheme became a focal point of crisis diplomacy, with the United States endorsing it, in principle, as a means to escape the crisis . The U.S. military’s aversion to provisions that might threaten United States rights to transport or station nuclear weapons in
 Cuba secretly hoped to retain the tactical nuclear weapons that the Soviet Union had deployed to the island . Also, for a time, Cuba hoped to keep the tactical weapons that Soviet Union deployed .
 Castro refused to reconsider his position, Brazil reluctantly withdrew its proposal in December . The debate spurred consideration of the concept of a Latin American NWFZ, a process that culminated five years later in the Treaty of Tlatelolco .
 Former Soviet counterpart, Sergei Kudryavtsev, is now in the Foreign Ministry of Russia . He had tried to monitor relations between the Communist countries of his new and prior postings .
 Brazilian surmised that Khrushchev felt pressure from the ongoing Sino-Soviet ‘tug of war’ for influence in Havana to prevent Mao Zedong from “outbidding him” for Cuban sympathies .
 The UK foreign office disputed this analysis, doubting that Khrushchev was motivated by concern that the Chinese might bring Cubans into their camp . The UK ambassador in Havana also did not see evidence for a Sino-Soviet ‘tug of war”
 Itamaraty’s ambassador in Havana, Luís Bastian Pinto, spoke several times with high-level Cubans, such as Foreign Minister Raúl Roa .
 Leitão da Cunha conferred with Western colleagues, such as U.S. Ambassador Foy D Kohler . He apparently did not meet any high-level Soviet personnel during the crisis .
 The most crucial high-level exchanges occurred through Moscow’s recently opened embassy in Rio, Brazil . Instead, the most crucial exchange occurred through the newly opened embassy .
 Goulart called for the acting Soviet ambassador to replace Adlai Stevenson and Valerian Zorin . On Thursday evening, 25 October, 25 October was a day remembered for the UN Security Council confrontation between Stevenson and Zorins .
 Fomin saw the Brazilian president around 7m., an hour after getting an urgent telephone summons via the editor of Última hora, a leftist Rio tabloid . Fomin says he received an urgent phone call from the editor, an editor of a Rio newspaper .
 President Goulart made clear that he wanted to discuss the Cuban situation . The ensuing conversation began a delicate balancing act by Brazil’s president .
 Brazil had been bound to stop the delivery of arms to Cuba based on past OAS declarations and agreements, he said . Cuba had insisted measures taken to stop arms not violate Cuba’s sovereignty .
 Goulart was replying to a letter from Kennedy that Gordon Gordon had delivered to him on the morning of 25 October 1962 . Kennedy had delivered the letter to him that morning .
 Kennedy had informed Goulart that the Cuban crisis was forcing him to cancel his planned upcoming trip to Brazil . In that letter, Kennedy had told him that he had canceled his planned trip .
 Goulart also commented, “with obvious disdain,” that other Latin American countries had obeyed Washington’s dictates, he said . He said Latin American nations have obeyed the dictates of Washington .
 Goulart repeated the story, widespread in the press, that Brazil’s OAS delegate, Ilmar Penna Marinho, “did not follow the government’�s orders,” for which he had been immediately recalled . Marinho also said that Brazil
 Itamaraty documents that were declassified decades later fail to support the contention that Penna Marinho violated his orders . Fomin noted that Goulart “declined to elaborate on how the representative deviated from his instructions,” Fomin said .
 In fact, the Brazilian envoy carefully abstained on the resolution authorizing the use of armed force to block the sending of offensive weapons to Cuba . The language might be construed as tacit approval for an attack on Cuba itself .
 If Cuba continues to reject inspection and the U.S. bombed alleged sites, Goulart vows to express strong opposition to military action . He says he has already affirmed that stand to United States officials .
 Fomin: Brazil could make a major contribution to the preservation of peace 57 years ago . Brazil's president underestimated his nation’s ‘role and prestige’, he said .
 Goulart said that the world is aware of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government . The Soviet government is constantly fighting to maintain peace in the world, he said . He said that Russia is fighting for peace .
 It is the monopolist circles in the U.S. that wish for the outbreak of war to find their way out of the contradictions inherent to the Capitalist system, Goulart said .
 Their anger is that Cuba is showing other Latin American countries a prime example . They are angry at Cuba's treatment of gays and lesbians . The Cuban government has been criticized for its treatment of women .
 The Americans are unlikely to come to terms with the existence of an independent socialist Cuba, he says . Precisely in this is the main concern of the USA, he said . The U.S. is unlikely to accept an independent socialism in Cuba .
 Buenos Aires turned rightward in 1962 when hardline anti-Communists ousted President Arturo Frondizi in a military coup . Buenos Aires had abruptly turned leftward in response to the government’s defense of Cuba .
 Brazil will send a delegation headed by Santiago Dantas to the UN in the next few days to suggest a draft proposal resembling the neutralization idea the foreign minister had pushed at Punta del Este . Goulart said he would be sending a delegation to the U.N.
 Goulart also told Gordon he was considering sending Dantas to bolster the diplomacy of Brazil’s UN ambassador, Afonso Arinos de Melo, but there is no indication he was in fact sent . There are no indications he was actually sent .
 Goulart recalls his “high hopes” for greater aid from Moscow, based on his exchanges with Chernyshev . He said it might be “essential” not only to improve Brazil’s economy but also to loosen Washington’�s grip .
 Goulart praised the defeat of candidates favored by anti-Communist Carlos Lacerda in Guanabara state . He lamented victories by ‘reactionaries’ in São Paulo state gubernatorial voting .
 Goulart disparaged U.S. Ambassador Gordon in comments that were at odds with the impression the Brazilian president had given the United States diplomat on the night of 22 October .
 Gordon and Walters huddled with Lima at Laranjeiras Palace late into the night . Goulart pledges Brazil’s support at the OAS in telephone calls with his diplomats in Washington .
 Goulart had taken some actions that annoyed Washington, but Gordon had not reported any personal animus on the president’s part . The State Department postmortem concluded that the Brazilian official line abounded in equivocations and contradictions during the crisis .
 This was not the first time that Brazil’s president, perhaps seeking to ingratiate himself with Khrushchev's diplomatic representative, lambasted him . This was perhaps not the last time that the president lambasted Kennedy’�s diplomatic representative .
 Goulart’s criticism of the United States undoubtedly pleased Fomin, but the Soviet diplomat did not let down his guard . Fomin: “The U.S. is not going to be easy to deal with, but it's not easy to do so .
 Fomin suspected that the Brazilian had “deliberately stretched out the meeting” so he could tell the press he had spoken at length with both Washington’s and Moscow's ambassadors . Press reports to that effect indeed soon appeared .
 By the time the talk ended, a little before 9:00 PM Rio time, it was the predawn darkness of the night .
 Fomin would have needed several hours to compose a cable, which would then have been encrypted and sent to Moscow to be decrypted at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs . The cable would have been sent to Russia to be encrypted and decrypted .
 His report on the conversation with Goulart and on Brazil’s potential peace initiative at the United Nations was circulated at the outset of the CPSU Presidium meeting on Saturday, 27 October .
 Fomin next met Goulart at Laranjeiras on Monday evening, 29 October . Khrushchev had agreed to withdraw the Soviet missiles from Cuba, ending the most acute phase of the crisis, although 63. Fomin was 63 when he first met Fomin .
 The Soviet diplomat was summoned urgently by Goulart’s protocol chief . The two sat down at 8:00 PM in the presidential palace in Moscow .
 Gordon was disturbed to hear that Goulart had sent his military aide, General Silva, to Cuba to deliver the message to Castro that the U.S. had conveyed two nights earlier . The United States had conveyed the message .
 U.S. preferred Brazil’s ambassador in Havana, Bastian Pinto, a career diplomat whom they trusted as firmly anti-Communist, speak to Cuban leader . United States officials disdaining Silva as too ‘leftist’ and ‘anti-American
 Gordon seemed satisfied at the envoy’s “not bad” instructions . He was presumably pleased by the compliments lavished on Kennedy for his handling of the crisis and its outcome . Washington had increasingly come to distrust of the president .
 Goulart offered a very different appraisal when Fomin called a few hours later, according to the Soviet record of their conversation . Fomin: "Goulart was not impressed with Fomin's performance, but he was impressed with his work in the field .
 Khrushchev for the humane and forward-looking actions, resulting in the extinguishing of events in the Caribbean Basin, which could have started a new nuclear war, which would bring untold misery to the entire civilized world .
 He stressed that this gratefulness came from not only himself as president, but also the official position of the whole Brazilian government . President: "I'm grateful for the support of the Brazilian government"
 Khrushchev in the prevention of armed conflict in this part of the world . The Soviet Union was in the midst of the Cold War in the 1950s .
 Khrushchev was a tireless fighter for peace, who did not spare any ounce of strength or energy to achieve this lasting goal . He was tireless and dedicated to the cause of peace .
 Goulart scoffed at “the American press and the reactionaries in his own country’s press” who 66.5 years ago was the president of the U.S.
 He also stressed that Brazil’s government and he personally considered the outcome of the crisis “a new, extremely important victory” for Soviet foreign policy . The crisis was a new victory for Soviet policy, he said .
 Goulart briefed the Soviet ambassador on the latest Brazilian diplomatic steps on the Cuban situation . Fomin thanked the Brazilian president for his kind words, which he promised to pass along to Moscow .
 Goulart mentioned only the United States . Fomin asked which countries, specifically, had made such a request .
 Goulart explained the mission of his military aide, who had left for Havana that afternoon and was likely meeting with Fidel Castro as they spoke . Fomin explained the choice to Fomin with more candor than he had to Gordon .
 The U.S. ambassador had asked why Silva, rather than Bastian Pinto, would converse with Castro, Goulart said . He had instructed his military aide to convey his personal dismay that Cuba had acted as a “Russian satellite,” mere Soviet “
 Only known specific mediation request came late Saturday night, 27 October, when Gordon came to Lima’s apartment with the ExComm-approved proposal for Rio to relay, as a Brazilian scheme, to Fidel Castro . In fact, Brazil had collaborated loosely with Josip Broz Tito
 The proposal essentially suggested that if Havana ordered the Soviet troops and missiles to be pulled out, then Cuba would be welcomed back into the OAS . Cuba would have many positive results would flow in terms of relations with the United States .
 Goulart told Fomin that he was “holding back” from entrusting sensitive missions to the Foreign Ministry . Silva was chosen because he was a confidant who “fully shared” his own views on Cuba, he said . Penna Marinho’
 Goulart said Brazil intended to submit to the UN General Assembly a resolution to create a Latin American NWFZ and also to guarantee non-aggression against Cuba and respect for its territorial integrity and people’s right to self-determination .
 Goulart said the United States and Cuban ambassadors in Rio had also been told of these plans . But Fomin sensed that the president was unaware of details being worked out by Dantas and other aides .
 Goulart claimed that he had received assurances from Washington that it would not take any “direct actions” against Cuba that could “frustrate or substantially obstruct” Brazil’s mediation bid . Fomin pressed for more information on the United States position .
 Goulart promised to inform Fomin of the results of Silva’s mission to Havana as soon as the general returned in a day or two . Requesting Moscow's “opinions and suggestions” on Brazil’S. proposals, Goular promised to
 Goulart again criticized Kennedy’s representative . Besides lavishly praising Khrushchev at this meeting, he also lavishly praised Kennedy's representative .
 In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry proposed a response to the CPSU Presidium . Fomin's telegram was sent to the Soviet foreign ministry in Moscow .
 The aide said Penna Marinho correctly favored preventing offensive arms shipments to Cuba but should have voted against rather than abstained on the passage implying authorization of force or intervention against Cuba .
 He says no consensus exists within Itamaraty and government over whether Penna Marinho violated his instructions . However, he also said no consensus existed over whether he had violated his orders .
 Fomin came to Silva's residence for an hour-and-forty-minute meeting on Friday, 2 November, after Silva returned to Rio . Silva and Fomin met at Fomin's residence in Rio de Janeiro .
 Before hearing Silva’s report on his two-day trip to Havana, Fomin orally delivered, for the military aide to pass 72 . Fomin delivered the report orally delivered for the general secretary .
 Silva said Goulart had given him a mission to take to Cuba . Silva said he had delivered a message to Fidel Castro . The mission he said he was given to Cuba differed considerably from the one sent to Brazilians .
 Lima: Goulart would send a courier, most likely General Silva, to deliver the idea . Lima: Castro wanted to avoid being cast as a slavish ally like Hungary’s Kádár or East Germany's Otto Grotewohl .
 Brazil's position is based on two propositions, which he stressed extended beyond the current crisis . With nary a word about the idea that Cuba should cut or at least sharply reduce its military ties to Moscow, Silva said .
 Brazil continued to insist that any resolution recognize guarantees of “non-aggression” against Cuba . Brazil also insisted on non-interference in Cuba’s internal affairs .
 Brazil would not immediately press its own proposal and instead would await a likely UN deadlock . He did not exclude an earlier effort to terminate the United States blockade if it did not end soon .
 Brazil's idea related to Castro’s “famous five points”—demands, issued on 28 October, for concessions to Cuba, including the return of the Guantanamo Bay naval base . Silva insisted that they did not seem “fundamentally” incompatible, as
 Silva had also met with acting UN Secretary General U Thant . The Brazilian emissary did not seem overly impressed with the UN chief . Fomin reported that Silva did not appear overly impressed .
 Silva termed Thant’s mission “very one-sided and narrow,” confined to convincing Castro to accept international inspection of the dismantling and departure of the Soviet missile sites . Silva: Thant's mission was to convince Castro to allow international inspection . Silva calls Thant
 The Brazilian general said he had bluntly expressed such criticisms directly to Thant . He said the United Nations must not ignore the Cuban people’s right to self-determination .
 The UN statesman did not rule out putting that idea before the UN, but insisted that the main thing now was to “buy time,” enabling Kennedy to pursue a more flexible policy after the impending congressional elections on 6 November .
 On 16 November 1962, Goulart showed Gordon Albino’s “fourteen-page handwritten letter” reporting the talk with Fidel Castro . The letter was published in November 1962 .
 The United States ambassador reported that Silva had placed “more relative emphasis on acceptance UN observers and less on detaching from Soviets, but main points were apparently presented,” albeit in a “perhaps more cordial” tone than Bastian Pinto .
 Silva stressed the urgency of intensified Soviet and East European support for Cuba to strengthen Castro’s regime in view of the damage his political prestige had sustained in Latin America . Silva said the crisis had damaged the Cuban regime's political prestige .
 Silva attributed Castro’s drop in prestige to appearance of missiles in Cuba . Silva said the missiles vindicated U.S. charges that Castro was turning the island into a Soviet military base .
 Although the weapons were not in Cuban hands, many believed the Soviet Union might use them for offensive purposes . Many believed the weapons might be used by the Soviets .
 Goulart’s government had to take account of ‘quite strong opposition’ in Brazilian public opinion to the Soviet missile deployment to Cuba, Silva said . Silva said that the government, in determining its stance on the Cuban issue, took account of public opposition .
 Silva expressed his willingness to hold further discussion on Cuba . Silva emphasized Goulart’s assignment to focus on Soviet-Brazilian economic issues . Silva expressed willingness to discuss Cuba but emphasized his interest in the country .
 Fomin completed arrangements for the succession at the embassy and was formally appointed by Moscow as the new Soviet ambassador to Brazil . Fomin returned his attention to expanding bilateral commerce, especially after Goulart relayed specific Brazilian proposals for conspicuous, large-scale construction projects .
 Goulart did so when Fomin formally presented his credentials as Soviet ambassador . Fomin died at the age of 60 .
 Prestes said he had heard that the Soviet government’s oral reply to Goulart's request for information bolstered the president's determination to resist U.S. pressure . Prestes: The Soviet government's oral reply had bolstered the President's determination .
 Kennedy administration would have been furious if Brazil had refused to go along with the blockade at the OAS . No evidence has surfaced to indicate that Washington explicitly threatened to cut aid to Brazil .
 Moscow’s evolving position on the Latin American denuclearization proposal . Brazil was pushing (with cosponsors Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador) in a UN General Assembly committee . The proposal was in a committee of members of the United States .
 As a result, the United States, Britain, several Latin American countries, and even some nonaligned countries that had previously signaled support were backing away . The U.S. and Britain are backing away from the Arab Spring .
 Brazil is in a “predicament” because the Cuban reservation triggered a chain reaction of likely abstentions, Carlos Bernardes says . Washington is “very cold” to the draft resolution, he says . Brazil was in “precision’s position
 A couple of days later, Soviet Ambassador Zorin at the UN confirmed to his Brazilian colleague that the Soviet Union, unable to diverge from Cuba, would abstain on the resolution .
 Both Zorin and Havana’s delegate, Carlos Lechuga, who had earlier welcomed the Brazilian concept, advised Arinos de Melo to withdraw the proposal rather than introduce it .
 Fomin returned to Brazil with Moscow's most solid position yet on Brazil’s Latin American NWFZ proposal . On 10 December, Fomin traveled to Brazil to discuss the proposal in Moscow .
 Fomin told a senior Itamaraty aide that the Soviet Union could support the Brazilian resolution, but only if it explicitly included Puerto Rico among the territories to be covered . Fomin said that the U.S. and Cuba could also support the resolution .
 Moscow and its allies would vote against the resolution and thus preferred that Brazil instead withdraw it . Otherwise, Russia and allies would have voted against it . Brazil has been criticized for not withdrawing the resolution from Russia .
 The Soviet stand put an end for the time being to the Latin American denuclearization effort . U.S. officials had told the Brazilians they might consider including Guantanamo and the Panama Canal Zone if they were the only obstacles . Puerto Rico was a nonstarter .
 Cuba's participation in a regional denuclearization conference could boost Fidel Castro’s international prestige and aid his reconciliation with Latin American countries . Still hoping to entice Moscow, J A. de Araújo Castro (later Goulart's foreign minister) told Fomin .
 Araújo Castro claimed that Kennedy’s government seemed to understand the danger of military intervention against Cuba . He said the government could accept a peaceful settlement with Havana but “expects to achieve this” with a post-Fidel government .
 The link functioned far more actively than that between the Kremlin or Soviet Foreign Ministry and Brazil’s ambassador in Moscow . The latter was a symbol of Itamaraty, an institution Goulart mistrusted . The relationship between Brazil and the Kremlin functioned much more actively
 The tenor of the Goulart-Fomin talks contrasted markedly with the pro-American sentiment that Brazil’s president stressed during the crisis to Gordon, according to the U.S. ambassador's reports . Brazil's president stressed that the United States was not involved in the
 Araújo Castro, head of Itamaraty’s department on international organizations, acknowledged opposition to a Latin American NWFZ in military circles . Some Latin American countries with “reactionary governments” (e.g., Argentina, Venezuela, and the Dominican
 Scholars differ as to whether Goulart had genuine Communist ideological predilections or merely flirted with the far left for pragmatic political reasons . Brazilian scholars differ on whether he had genuine ideological preoccupations .
 One of the journal’s anonymous reviewers noted, Moniz Bandeira, and Fico, favor the latter interpretation, especially given the Communist influence in Brazilian unions .
 Goulart spoke sympathetically about the plight of peoples and countries suffering under the yoke of capitalist/imperialist domination . He spoke favorably about their eventual “emancipation” from “the oppression of American capital” to an independent and socialist future .
 Even before the missile crisis, U.S. officials were suspicious of Goulart’s leftist tilt and links . Kennedy administration had soured on him after his April 1962 visit to Washington .
 When the crisis erupted, Kennedy leapt at the chance to defer indefinitely a reciprocal visit to Brazil, not wanting to seem unduly supportive of a leader unwilling, in Washington’s view, to manage his economy effectively or control leftist or Communist influence .
 Around the time of the crisis, coincidentally, a high-level U.S. government “survey group” headed by General William H Draper, visited Brazil .
 State Department's top analyst sent Rusk a scathing indictment of Goulart’s ‘equivocal’ conduct during the missile crisis . The State Department also wrote a damning report to Kennedy complaining of anti-American “communists and ultranationalists”
 Kennedy’s ExComm debated the option of plotting to oust Goulart, possibly via a military coup . Instead, it opted to send Attorney General Robert F Kennedy to deliver a virtual ultimatum . Attorney General was warned to purge Communist-leaning, radical, anti-American
 The hastily organized meeting on 17 December in Brasília went nowhere . Robert Kennedy came away manifestly unimpressed with the meeting .
 Washington began to cultivate contacts with Goulart’s opposition, especially in the military, fearing turmoil . Washington feared turmoil could lead Brazil to a leftist dictatorship and the Soviet bloc .
 Although it is impossible to know for certain, such a consequence seems plausible . Such a result seems plausible, such an outcome seems plausible.
 Goulart’s cozy dealings with Fomin might merely have confirmed, in more damning detail, the negative view of the Brazilian leader they already held . On the other hand, knowledge of Fomin's cozy dealings might merely confirm, in fact, a negative view .
 Goulart performed his high-wire balancing act for another sixteen months . He oscillated between protestations of friendship with Washington and nods to leftist public opinion in domestic and foreign policy . He ultimately veered in the latter direction before being toppled in a military coup .
 The new regime took power in April 1964, while severing ties with Castro’s Cuba and taking an unabashedly pro-American, anti-Communist line . However, it kept diplomatic and trade links with the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies .
 Brazil’s dictatorial rulers retained elements of the ‘independent’ foreign policy their predecessors had advocated and attempted to conduct in the early 1960s . To that extent, even while jettisoning Goulart's ambivalent diplomacy .
 In December 1962, he predicted to a Cuban visitor that “Brazil and other countries” might “enter into revolution” by the end of Kennedy’s (expected) second term . He also predicted that Brazil and other nations might ‘enter into revolutions”
