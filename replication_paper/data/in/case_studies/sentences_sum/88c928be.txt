 For character, the first of these, we have a broad-based learning program, including a storytelling session in which we are sharing inspirational tales . We are sharing those inspirational tales oft-told in our families about ancestors .
 Ambassador Edwin M “Ed” Martin shares his grandfather's story with students . Ambassador Martin: "I was delighted to be invited, and delighted to share this story of my grandfather"
 The two most powerful words in the English language are “for example” because there is no better way to understand something being explained– to better retain it, internalize it, apply it– than to hear about the action in practice .
 The characters we care about the most are often, of course, our own family members . Family stories can be so powerful that they can be powerful, says the author .
 Many of us revere our grandfathers and grandmothers, many of us think of them as our heroes . Many of them are our heroes, and we revere them very fondly . This week marks the 50th anniversary of President Barack Obama's election to the White House .
 For instance, I remember vividly being 6 years old, when my next door neighbor friend told me full of sincerity and certainty that his grandfather killed Hitler . For example, he said he was 6 when he told me that Hitler killed Hitler. For example .
 "I believed it at first, but then over time I slowly realized he was exaggerating," she says . "It speaks to how much he viewed his grandfather as a hero in his life," she adds .
 I’m going to tell you now about the time when my grandfather saved the world—or at least saved the United States & Russia from a major nuclear war— and I will understand that you may be skeptical about this claim, as I should have been skeptical about my friend�
 My grandfather saved our nation, and Russia, from a devastating nuclear war . As you will see, my grandfather saved Russia, and the U.S. from a nuclear war, he says .
 Many Americans living in that time thought it was the most frightening moment they have lived through . Nearly all historians of the era agree that this was the moment in the decades from 1945 to the present when nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR came closest to occurring .
 In the background of the crisis was very high tension between the two superpowers . The crisis was the height of tension between Russia and the U.S.
 The crisis began when spy planes flew over Cuba, taking photos of things happening there, and you need to remember that Cuba under Fidel Castro had just recently become an ally of the Soviet Union . Cuba under Castro had recently become a ally of Russia .
 The Soviets were installing nuclear launch pads in Cuba, scientists say . Back to the lab they took the photos, and examined them with magnifying glasses . They found, shockingly, in early October, that they were installing launch pads .
 The threat posed by a surprise missile launch from Cuba is the US, says CNN's John Sutter . Cuba is very close to the U.S. and the threat posed, he says .
 Edwin Martin is the Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America . Martin is a member of the State Department's Latin American Advisory Council . Martin has been in Latin America for more than a decade .
 Together they met in what was called the Executive Committee, or Excom, for the famous 13 days of the crisis . They huddled and managed it together very closely .
 The crisis had two critical junctures, two key forks in the road, two moments when especially major decisions had to be made and where a different decision could or would have led to a very different outcome .
 The first key moment occurred right away, in the very first days of the crisis, says CNN.com's John Sutter . "It was a very important moment," he says .
 At the start, a highly influential and assertive group of the ExCom members argued for a prompt airstrike against the installations . This seemed to be the majority viewpoint and had all the momentum behind it .
 After several days of discussion, the quarantine option rose from a distant second to the chosen path . An immediate airstrike was ruled out . The quarantine option was also ruled out, and an immediate airstrike is ruled out.
 Bobby Kennedy, the President’s brother, Attorney General, pushed hard for the blockade/quarantine alternative . Bobby Kennedy's grandfather's support for quarantine made a big difference, he says .
 We avoided what very probably would have been nuclear war . We can say that because the quarantine alternative prevailed, we avoided what may have been a nuclear war.
 A few things about my grandfather’s character, and remember this story, are illuminated here . Remember this story is intended for Character Day, and it's not about him .
 He knew to take time in his decision-making, to not immediately follow his gut, to seriously, thoughtfully, and thoroughly consider the implications and possibly unexpected outcomes of his choices .
 When the pressure was on, in those first hours after discovery of the launch pads, many or most urged we strike right away, but he instead pushed to slow down the decision-making and make a better decision .
 Students, I know when I have a tough decision to make, Second, he had the independence of thought and courage of his convictions to go against majority opinion and hold his own .
 Many are cowed into changing their opinion to suit the majority or into keeping silent . It was no easy thing to oppose the majority, and many are cowering into changing .
 One of his main reasons for opposing the airstrike was his deep concern about how such an action would be viewed among American allies in Latin America, the President of Mexico, Argentine, Brazil, etc. Third, he said .
 As Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America, these were his constituents, in a sense . They were whom he was responsible for maintaining good relations, and he empathized with their point of view . He knew they would be deeply offended by an American attack .
 "It was in part by his having this empathy, and making this argument, that he was able to help the group toward an alternative choice– for quarantine, not airstrike," he says .
 Students, try yourself to take the perspective of others, to walk in their shoes or see through their eyes, before making decisions or taking actions . Students are encouraged to be more aware of others' perspective .
 The second critical juncture occurred toward the end of the 13-day crisis .
 The blockade, or quarantine, was working to stop Soviet ships, but not to remove the nuclear launchpads . The blockade was meant to stop the Soviet ships but not remove the launchpad .
 The first Russian ship approached the first U.S. Navy ship and was told to turn back, but turn back it did . It had been a terrifying moment, as they had had no idea what would happen when the first ship approached .
 The ships did not return all the way back to Russia, just back out to the Atlantic . But ships did return to Russia .
 The nuclear launchpads were still being built in Cuba, and the threat still rising . The threat was still rising.
 The Soviets at first issued strong denunciations . The American public was increasingly frightened and obsessed with the crisis, and the anxiety was unbearable .
 Khrushchev sent a letter to the White House from the Soviet leader, Khrushchchev . The letter was sent in the midst of this terrible tensio, a letter from Khrushchevitch .
 Many in the Kennedy administration took the second letter as a heightening of tensions, and some very influential figures at first saw it as all the more reason to prepare for war .
 The Excom met again, trying to figure out how to resolve the confusion and crisis of the two contrary letters, and what to do next which would not mean a complete defeat for the United States nor would lead to nuclear war .
 Ed Martin's grandfather Ed Martin’s suggestion was to ignore the second letter, and respond to the first letter publicly, sharing it with the world . Instead of obsessing over the the challenge, demands, threats, and crisis created by the letter, as everyone else was doing,
 President Kennedy took the decision to withdraw from the White House . President Kennedy made the decision after a series of hours of discussion .
 He had the kind of mind that could see an option others couldn’t easily recognize . But he also had the mind that would see an alternative .
 He displayed a temperament and a judiciousness to decide not only what must be addressed and responded to, but also what could be set aside . Second, he displayed a temper and judiciousity to decide what should be addressed .
 We say sometimes that discretion is the better part of a valor . Critical thinking and evaluation is often about determining what information should be dismissed, ignored, or dropped so we can keep our focus on the important things .
 The second letter was a great, terrible, threat and challenge, and most of the ExCom were so upset or offended by the threat that they saw only red, only danger, only competition . The ExCom was so upset that they were so offended that the threat was only red .
 Khrushchev did want peace, he did want a settlement, and let’s grab the good and work on the positive opportunity, not obsess over the bad news . Let’t obsess over bad news, not the good news, says CNN.com's John Sutter
 Students: Sometimes when you hear or see a friend, peer, or classmate say or something really nice or great, and then do or say something really mean or nasty, you have a choice too . Students: When you hear a friend say something nice, but then say something nasty,
 "You understand better now, students, I hope, why I believe my grandfather saved the world," she said .
 If your grandfather is still alive, please give him a hug and a handshake for me . If you have a grandfather who is alive, he'll be in touch with you .
 I watched a documentary about the Cuban missile crisis, and was always amazed by how clear-headed your grandfather appeared to be, and how willing he seemed to be to stand against the militaristic tide . Your grandfather was always willing to stand up against militarism, he says .
 Truly inspiring, Jonathan, in numerous ways, says Jonathan .
 I loved learning that Adm Edwin Martin was your beloved grandfather, loved your testimonial to your students, and loved how you used an exercise like this to teach so much . Adm. Edwin Martin's beloved grandfather was your grandfather, I said .
 What an interesting and pointed story that does, in fact, show true strength of character and what it can mean .
 While I agree that the immediate result of the approach in the short term was successful, I think the long term effects have been disastrous. While I think that the approach was successful in short term, I also think it was disastrous in the long-term .
 It is an easy, but illogical assumption that a surprise, surgical attack of the nuclear sites would not have totally neutralized them . The assumption is that a surgical attack on the sites would have been totally neutralizing them .
 We discovered only the building of launch pads through sophisticated aerial photo reconnaissance technology . This would, logically, have shown in place armed sites . We found the launch pads were built by sophisticated aerial photography .
 We have only the “word’s of the Russians that the sites were active…and we all know how truthful they were then . Knowing the Russian philosophy of warfare, I doubt that they would have given any commander on the ground authority to initiate a nuclear strike that in turn
 The quarantine did give the USSR time to equip and activate those sites and therein was the true nuclear danger . The quarantine gave the Soviet Union time to activate the sites and that was the real danger .
 Cuba still remains a fully Communist country ruled by non-benevolent dictators 50 years later . The after effects left Castro and the Russians free, for decades, to spread Communism throughout Latin and Central America, and we now see the results of that in our disastrous relations with the presidents of
 As one who has served in combat, rarely does the slow decision making process save lives or accomplish goal . Look, for example, at the WWI Armistice, Neville Chamberlain’s negotiations and concessions to Hitler, the 60 year ongoing “cease-fire”
 "There was a much wider agreement with Khrushchev than indicated," he says . "He accomplished what he wanted," he adds. "There were a much broader agreement"
 What a fascinating post and response from Ken is Ken's response .
 I was in my final year of high school and can clearly remember walking through an almost empty high school wondering if the world was going to end in the next day or two . "I was in high school. I can clearly . remember walking . through an . almost empty school. wondering
 It is fascinating to learn about the interesting role he played in the Crisis . It is a fascinating story about his role in the crisis .
