 When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged ""missile gap"" with the Soviets leading . One of Kennedy's key election themes was the alleged 'Missile gap' in 1960 .
 In fact, the United States led the Soviets by a wide margin that would only increase . The U.S. led the Soviet Union in the early years of the Cold War .

 If the U.S. tried to bargain with the Soviets after becoming aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin . If the United States tried to trade the missiles with the Soviet Union, the missiles would go to West Berlin instead .
 Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev . The trade would have been a victory for the U.S. since the war .

 Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact effectively strengthened Castro's position in Cuba, guaranteeing that the United States would not invade Cuba . The practical effect of the pact was that the U.S. would not attack Cuba .

 Historian says Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept missiles . Schlesinger Jr. told National Public Radio in 2002 that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khruschev had pressured Castro .
 Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was angrier with Khrushchev than he was with Kennedy . Castro was not completely happy with the idea but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them to protect Cuba against U.S. attack .
 In early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had received tactical nuclear warheads for artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers . Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the U.S. with remaining missiles .
 Castro stated he would have recommended their use if the U.S. invaded Cuba . Castro stated that he would not have recommended the use of the weapons despite knowing Cuba would be destroyed .
 An argument broke out among three officers on the B-59, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain Vasili Arkhipov .
 Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests . The U.S. did not list their demands on the list, but Khrushche decided to keep them .
 Anastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal . The deal was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union .
 While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro . Castro was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the U.S. at the expense of Cuba's defense .
 Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with independent nuclear deterrent .
 He alerted the citizens of the United States that the Soviet Union had broken its previous promises . The Soviet Union was building missile delivery equipment in Cuba, he said .
