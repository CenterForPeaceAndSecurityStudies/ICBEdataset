 For the next six days the president and his advisers secretly deliberated about the U.S. response to the attack, they deliberated on the American response . President Obama and his team deliberated for six days before the attack .
 The new threat upset the nuclear balance and placed nuclear missiles capable of destroying most U.S. cities on the territory of a new enemy, Premier Fidel Castro . Fidel Castro is the new enemy of the United States .
 The Kennedy administration sought to keep the news secret, but shared it with the new acting secretary general of the United Nations . U Thant is a quiet unassuming Burmese diplomat named U. Thant .
 Admiral John McCain informed Thant’s military adviser, Major General Indar Jit Rikhye, about the missiles . Adm. John McCain, military adviser at the United States Mission to the United Nations, informed the U.N. on October 20, 1962 .
 General Rikhye went to the Pentagon for a secret brieﬁng and received an album of U.S. photos of the menacing missiles . He showed the photos to Thant .
 Rikhye informed Thant that Kennedy would be making an important television broadcast that evening concerning the missiles . Two days later, on Monday, October 22, Thant learned of the missile strike .
 Thant conferred with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson,5 and watched Kennedy make one of the most momentous presidential speeches of the century . Thant conferring with the United States .
 The president announced a “naval quarantine’s of Cuba, pushing the world closer to nuclear war than ever before . The world is now closer to a nuclear war .
 U.N. Secretary General Thant was to play a signiﬁcant role in de-escalating and then resolving the nuclear standoff 1.5 years ago . In the deepening crisis, the United Nations, and speciﬃcally secretary general Th

 Thant sent appeals and messages, relayed proposals, offered reassurances . Thant shuttled to Cuba to mollify Castro, helped secure a veriﬁcation arrangement .
 During the crisis, the Kennedy administration came to rely heavily upon the UN secretary general . The Kennedy administration relied heavily on the UN chief .
 In fact, the United Nations and its secretary general enjoyed enormous public prominence during the crisis and for a brief period afterwards .
 Headlines in U.S. and Russian newspapers hailed Thant for his part in de-escalating the crisis . Thant's role was hailed as a key role in ending the crisis in Paris .
 It was only after the crisis, as its history was being written, that the U.N. was edged out . The United Nations has been edged out of the world's most powerful organization .
 The view that Kennedy’s threat of force alone had compelled the Soviets to back down was vigorously advanced . The view of the Soviets had been vigorously advanced by the Soviet Union .
 The popular belief became that, when the superpowers went eyeball to eyeball, ‘the other guy blinked,”7 as Secretary of State Dean Rusk had put it .7 as secretary of state Rusk said .
 This famous quotation was used repeatedly by traditionalists to characterize the conﬂict as an unequivocal American victory .
 Revisionists have contended Kennedy needlessly risked war for domestic political gain . Revisionists say Kennedy risked war in order to win the war for political gain.
 The added poignancy and signiﬁcance of Thant’s action is that he corresponded directly with the heads of the superpowers . Thant helped them pull back from the brink during the world's most dramatic nuclear showdown .
 New sources have allowed some factual adjustments to our understanding of the Cuban missile crisis, including Thant’s efforts . Thant's efforts have led to some facts about the missile crisis .
 Most of these have been based upon the release of the transcripts of the deliberations of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, known as ExComm,11 . ExComm was composed of Kennedy’s principal advisers during the crisis .
 Soviet sources also became available, as did the testimonies of the actual participants in the crisis . Soviet sources were also available, along with the testimonies from actual participants .
 No studies have been devoted to the role Thant played in the French Revolution .

 It’s quite obvious that what they think they can do is try to get Berlin, it's quite obvious . It's not clear what the government wants to do, it says. It's a good idea to try and get Berlin.
 The president kept an appointment with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko on October 17 . To ensure the Soviets did not learn that the U.S. knew about the missiles, the president even kept a secret appointment .
 Gromyko asserted that the only assistance the Soviet Union was providing to Cuba was for agriculture, plus a small amount of “defensive” arms . The only assistance provided was agriculture, and defense arms, he said .
 Kennedy reiterated his earlier statements that serious consequences would arise if the Soviet Union placed missiles or offensive weapons in Cuba, but Gromyko assured him this would never be done . Kennedy: "Serious consequences would not be possible if the Soviets placed missiles in Cuba"
 The “hawks’s” advocated an immediate air assault and invasion of Cuba, while the “doves” called for negotiations and concessions .
 The compromise position of a ‘naval quarantine’ became Kennedy’s preferred option . Gradually, the compromise position became Kennedy's preferred option. The compromise was a compromise position that led to a naval quarantine .
 It involved force but still allowed negotiation and a Soviet missile withdrawal without hostilities . The withdrawal allowed negotiations and the withdrawal of missiles without war .
 A naval blockade was, in international legal terminology, an act of war that required a declaration of war . The word quarantine was used because of a naval blockade . A blockade was declared by the U.S. in the 1930s, but a blockade was not declared a war .
 Many Americans expected the United Nations to play a role in the crisis, though not necessarily its secretary general . During that week of secret deliberations, many of the Americans expected that the U.N. would take a role .
 The U.N. would provide reliable observers to verify a possible Soviet missile withdrawal . They conﬁned the United Nations to, ﬁrstly, a forum in which the United States would win the battle of world opinion and, secondly, an agency that would
 On numerous occasions during that ﬁrst week, the United Nations was discussed in ExComm . ExComm. discussed the U.N. on numerous occasions .
 As early as October 20, Kennedy stated that at the United Nations, the U.S. should identify the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba as “subterranean” in nature . Kennedy: The United States should identify it as ‘subtentranean’
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk said the U.S. should get UN teams to inspect all 13 . Two days later, on October 22, said the United States should get the UN teams inspecting the 13 .
 Kennedy thought the United States should frighten the UN representatives with the prospect of all kinds of actions and then, when a resolution was proposed for the withdrawal of missiles from Cuba, Turkey, and Italy, the U.S. could consider supporting it . Kennedy: "The United States could
 U.S. action at U.N. should be aimed at removing missile threat, he says . OAS should be to persuade other Latin American countries to act with the United States, he adds .
 Secretary Rusk reiterated his view that the United States aim should be a standstill of missile development in Cuba .
 Attorney General Robert Kennedy stated the United States should take the offensive rather than defensive at the United Nations . Kennedy stated that the Soviet leaders had lied about the strategic missile deployment in Cuba .
 The ExComm envisaged some roles for the United Nations in the crisis . Kennedy gave Secretary General Thant advance warning about the Soviet missiles in Cuba .
 The president and his advisers did not anticipate how signiﬁcant a role Thant would play . What they didn't anticipate, however, was how he would play a role in the White House .
 Not even Adlai Stevenson, a friend of Thant, anticipated the extent of his intervention and mediation . Thant’s intervention was not anticipated by Stevenson, who was a friend .
 As the crisis evolved, the new secretary general made appeals to the parties, offered proposals, transmitted messages, visited Cuba, and performed other intermediary functions . At a critical moment, the Secretary General’s intervention led to the diversion of the Soviet ships headed for Cuba and interception by our
 Adlai Stevenson: "This was the indispensable ﬁrst step in the peaceful resolution of the Cuban crisis" Stevenson made the statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 13, 1963 .
 A confrontation between Soviet ships en route to Cuba and the American navy was imminent . A confrontation was imminent between the Soviet and American navy ships .
 Many people feared an escalation to general war, perhaps by the Soviet seizure of West Berlin, and even a nuclear exchange . Many feared a general war with the Soviet Union .
 Almost half the UN members, mostly the nonaligned countries, implored Secretary General U Thant to assume an intermediary .
 Adlai Stevenson later called this intervention an essential “ﬁrst step” in resolving the crisis . Stevenson later said this intervention was the “essential” step in the right direction .
 Thant sent his message on October 24, which happened to be UN Day, in the afternoon, only a few hours after the quarantine had taken effect . Thant said he sent his first message to the two leaders only hours after quarantine began .
 It contained an urgent appeal for a moratorium of two to three weeks involving both the voluntary suspension of all arms shipments to Cuba and the quarantine measures, especially the searching of ships bound for Cuba .
 Thant suggested that if the U.S. pledged not to invade, the offensive armaments might be withdrawn . Thant read his message at the Security Council meeting on the night of October 24 .
 This was a critical proposal, but it was ignored at the time by the participants. This was not the first time the proposal was made, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "This is a very important proposal for the future of the world."
 The Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations, Valery Zorin, privately censured Thant for not 25. After the meeting, the Soviet ambassador to the U.N. protested against Thant's actions . Thant was later censured by the ambassador .
 U Thant’s comments on his message from the UN are published in the U.S. edition of U.N. magazine . Also see U. Thant's comments on the UN .
 At that televised Council meeting, Thant informed the Council of his identical messages to President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev . Thant said the messages were identical to the messages sent by the Soviets .
 In the Security Council, Thant suggested a Soviet missile withdrawal in exchange for a United States nonaggression guarantee . Thant: "The United States blockade of a sovereign state" forcefully criticizing the U.S. blockade .
 Khrushchev's response to Thant’s message was overwhelmingly positive . Zorin was embarrassed by the response to the message .
 At about 3:30m. on October 25, the secretary general received the Soviet leader’s cable . The cable was signed by Soviet leader Vladimir Putin at the time of October 25 .
 I have received your message and carefully studied the proposal it contains. I have carefully studied your proposal . I have studied it carefully and carefully .
 Soviet Government too regards it as highly dangerous and as requiring immediate intervention by the 30 . I understand your concern over the situation which has arisen in the Caribbean, for the Soviet Government .
 I wish to inform you that I agree to your proposal, which is in the interest of peace, I say . I also agree to the proposal, and I think it's in the interests of peace . I wish you to write to the editor of this article .
 Khrushchev's positive response to Thant’s message helped him save face as he ordered most Soviet ships heading to Cuba to turn back . Most Soviet ships headed to Cuba were ordered to return .
 These ships would soon enter the interception zone, which could lead to their capture or destruction, and to war . The interception zone is the largest interception zone in the world, and could be used in war .
 As this drama unfolded, American ofﬁcials initially reacted negatively to Thant’s message .
 The American feeling was publicly guarded and privately almost hostile . The American public feeling was publicly guarded . The U.S. felt almost almost hostile.
 At 2:30m. on October 24, Thant had told Adlai Stevenson that he was going to send identical messages to Khrushchev and Kennedy at 6m. calling for a voluntary suspension of arms shipments to Cuba and the lifting of the quarantine .
 Stevenson expressed disappointment that these communiqués would not include any mention of the missiles or their construction sites in Cuba . Stevenson asked Thant to postpone sending the messages for twenty-four hours .
 U.N. secretary general refused but agreed to meet Stevenson again at 5pm . He met with Charles Yost, a member of the U.S. mission to the United Nations .
 At that meeting Thant advised them that the telegrams had already been sent .
 Ambassador Stevenson asked Thant to include in the speech he was going to make to the Security Council that night a reference to the need to stop military construction in Cuba . Ambassador Stevenson responded to the request by asking Thant .
 Thant agreed to do so, though he refused to say anything about the missiles already in place . Thant said he would not comment on missiles already being deployed in the country .
 President Rusk immediately told Rusk to get back to Stevenson on it,36 in other words to press Thant to delay his message . The president immediately responded to the request .
 The president and his advisers were apprehensive about Thant’s message for the same reasons Stevenson had been . Clearly the president and advisers were anxious about the message .
 British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, in a telephone conversation with Kennedy, condemned the message .
 Kennedy received his second correspondence from Khrushchev since the beginning of the crisis . It was the second correspondence since the October 24 crisis .
 Thant accused Kennedy of issuing ultimatum that the U.S. would never accept . Khrushchev accused of pushing mankind toward nuclear war, cable cable says .
 We will then be forced to take the measures . . . to protect our rights. We will be forced on our part to take . the measures, she says .
 Though many ships had turned back, this was little consolation to the United States. The United States had no choice but to turn back the ship .
 A Soviet tanker called the Bucharest was rapidly approaching the interception zone, and the president was under pressure to board it . A Soviet ship was approaching the intercept zone and was heading for an interception zone .
 At about 10:30m. that night, Kennedy spoke by phone to Under Secretary of State George Ball regarding Khrushchev’s stated intention to defy the quarantine . Kennedy spoke to Ball on the night of the incident . Kennedy called Ball to discuss the situation with Ball at 10
 The president had little time to decide how to deal with the Soviet ships still heading toward Cuba . Khrushchev had already turned back the ships he didn't want us to have .
 To let them pass would indicate that the U.S. lacked the resolve to enforce the quarantine, CNN's John Sutter says .
 Under Secretary Ball said that the president’s previous instructions to reply to it immediately had Ambassador Stevenson in 38.5 minutes . Ambassador Stevenson was in 38 minutes .
 Kennedy called Ball again with a new idea . Kennedy calls Ball again an hour later with an idea for a new project . Kennedy: "It's a great idea. It's a good idea" Kennedy says he wants to make the project happen .
 In fact, the president had just received Khrushchev’s extremely hostile communiqué threatening deﬁance of quarantine . The president was in the midst of a quarantine .
 Khrushchev had ordered back many ships48 and undoubtedly now realized that a second message from Thant might help him save face . Kennedy was aware from U.S. intelligence that Khrushvic had ordered many ships back . But Kennedy was also aware of intelligence that the message might help
 There was extensive discussion in ExComm that day, October 24, about the many Soviet ships that had turned around . ExComm discussed the many ships that turned around.
 President Kennedy said, “some of these ships, the ones we're particularly interested in, have turned around.” Kennedy said in a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Macmillan . Also said that some of the ships had turned around .
 Stevenson immediately called the secretary general, getting him out of bed . Stevenson called the Secretary General, who was in bed, to get him out .
 In that discussion Thant agreed to issue a direct appeal to the Soviets in the morning . Thant agrees to issue an appeal to Soviet Russia in the night .
 The contents of that message were handed to Thant by Stevenson on the morning of October 25 in the form of a single typed page . Thant: "What the United States wanted"
 Rusk wanted Stevenson to have Thant send to Khrushchev as Thant’s own proposal . It listed the points that Rusk had asked Stevenson to send them to the Soviet leader .
 Concern that Soviet ships might be under instructions to challenge quarantine and consequently create a confrontation at sea between Soviet ships and Western Hemisphere ships which could lead to an escalation of violence .
 An expression of concern that such a confrontation would destroy the possibility of the talks such as you have suggested as a prelude to a political settlement . The UK is concerned that a confrontation with Iran could destroy the chance of a political solution .
 An expression of hope that Soviet ships will be held out of the interception area for a limited time in order to permit discussions of the modalities of an agreement .
 An expression of your conﬁdence, on the basis of Soviet ships not proceeding to Cuba, that the United States will avoid a direct confrontation with 50. U.S. Navy ships will not proceed to Cuba .
 The United States asked Thant to send a second message before it had even responded to his first one . Ironically, the U.S. asked him to send the second message .
 President's response to Thant’s message emphasized that the crisis was created by the secret introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba . The president said the answer lay in their removal .
 The president then referred to Thant’s suggestions made in the Security Council to promote preliminary talks and satisfactory arrangements . The president assured the secretary general that Ambassador Stevenson was ready to discuss these arrangements with him .
 Stevenson had requested the request from Stevenson earlier that day . Stevenson's request was almost word for word what he had requested in writing . Stevenson had written a letter to the White House asking for more money .
 Thant asked Khrushchev to instruct Soviet vessels en route to Cuba to stay away from the interception area for a limited time . Thant: "I want to know if any of the ships are going to be intercepted by Soviet vessels."
 Thant asked Kennedy, in a separate though similar message, to instruct U.S. vessels to do everything possible to avoid direct confrontation with Soviet ships . Thant also asked Kennedy to instruct United States vessels to . avoid direct confrontations with Soviet vessels .
 Kennedy asked Thant to convey his second appeal to the Soviets as his own proposal . Kennedy understood the importance of giving his opponent an honorable way out of the situation .
 To accept a proposal directly from his adversary to withdraw all his remaining ships would have been viewed as a complete retreat . To now accept a . proposal directly . from his adversaries would have . been seen as a . complete retreat, he said .

 President Kennedy’s reply to U Thant is reprinted in Kennedy, Thirteen Days, 185 . President Kennedy's reply to the letter is reprinted here .
 Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland later claimed that the United States provided wording for Thant’s second message to Khrushchev . Cleveland also claimed to have provided the wording for the message to Kennedy .
 Kennedy suggested this tactic to Ball, he was transcending very strongly felt American and British apprehensions about Thant’s ﬁrst message . Ball was the leader of the British Empire .
 Kennedy realized he could use a mediator to get his opponent to gracefully disengage without appearing to surrender or display weakness . Kennedy: "During the most desperate moments of the crisis when others were girding for confrontation, . Others were goring for confrontation."
 As in other mediated conﬂicts, compromises proposed by the mediator often originate with one of the protagonists . When presented as a mediator’s idea they appear more palatable .
 By his actions on the night of October 24, Kennedy facilitated the transformation of the conﬂict from a bilateral to a mediated one .
 The Americans could not anticipate that Khrushchev would accept both messages . ExComm deliberated on October 25 about possible responses to Cuba-bound ships and their cargo .
 Kennedy knew Thant was working for conﬂict resolution . Kennedy tempered Kennedy at this juncture, knowing Thant worked for a resolution .
 Khrushchev continues to have come towards Cuba . One of these ships, the selected ships, is that one of the ships which Khrushvic continues to be coming towards Cuba.
 On the other hand we have U Thant, and we don’t want to sink a ship . The Russians are supposed to stay out, but U. Thant is supposedly arranging for the Russians to stay .
 I think tomorrow night we will know a lot better about this matter of the UN's actions and Khrushchev’s attitude about continuing his shipping . The UN's decision to allow shipping of Soviet Union material was a mistake .
 Khrushchev was determined to avoid action at sea until he knew whether Thant’s second message would convince him to hold back his ships . He was determined not to take action until he could see if Thant's second message was enough to convince him .
 Khrushchev’s acceptance of his second proposal was accepted on October 26, 1962 . Thant's proposal was the first to be accepted by the Soviet Union in Moscow .
 The stand-still at sea permitted a period of communication between the parties that focused on the issues of Cuban security and missiles . It was the first time the two sides had been able to communicate for more than a year .
 Leaders’ attention was no longer ﬁxed on a naval confrontation . Tension over the situation at sea did not dissipate totally, but the leaders’ .
 Negotiations on the core issues soon began and would lead to resolution of the crisis a mere two days later . The crisis would be resolved two days after .
 Both the United States and the Soviet Union weighed their actions with careful consideration of their impact on international opinion . Throughout the conﬂict both the U.S. and the . Soviet Union considered their actions carefully .
 The proceedings were televised live and watched by many worldwide, including Kennedy in the White House .
 Thant also inﬂuenced the superpower game in the Security Council at the climactic moment . Thant: "The superpower game was in place at the height of the crisis"
 The Security Council meeting of October 25 was one of the most famous UN meetings ever held . The meeting was held on October 25, 1973 . It was the first time the UN Security Council had been held in the Security Council .
 President Kennedy spoke on the phone with Ambassador Stevenson outside the Security Council chambers 67 . President Kennedy called Ambassador Stevenson before the meeting .
 Thant is seated third from the left at the horseshoe table with hand to chin. . to insist that his speech be of moderate tone. Thant was seated third . from the . left . at the table with the hand to . chin to chin . to . insist that
 He emphatically demanded that Soviet Ambassador Zorin declare to the world if the Soviet Union had missiles in Cuba or not . The Soviet Union did not, he said, but it was not clear if it had missiles .
 Khrushchev has assumed the role of a mediator, says Khrushchchev . He will be able to cope with his responsible mission provided, of course, that each party drawn into this controversy displays good will .
 Khrushchev dictated his long letter to Kennedy outlining a peaceful settlement . October 26 was the day he dictated the letter . In Moscow, October 26, was October 26 .
 ExComm morning meeting focused on ideas of how to proceed now that the situation at sea seemed stable . ExComm: "We are looking at what we need to do" ExComm meets in Washington, D.C., on October 26 .
 The U.S. precondition to these negotiations was a freeze on the construction at the missile sites in Cuba so that they remained inoperable . The United States preconditions were a freeze to the construction of the sites .
 The Americans were not aware that some of the nuclear weapons were already operable . The Americans did not know some of their nuclear weapons had already been operable.
 Kennedy appointed John McCloy to head the United States delegation . McCloy is a former assistant secretary of war in World War II and former World Bank president .
 ExComm was exhausted after eleven grueling days of crisis . Though an agreement was suddenly reached on October 28, it could not be predicted even 75 years later .
 U Thant sent a cable to Castro on October 26 stating he had received encouraging responses to his appeal to the U.S. and Soviet Union for negotiations . He urged that construction of the missile installations in Cuba be suspended during these negotiations .
 Castro replied with a cable the next day inviting U Thant to visit Cuba . Castro replied by inviting him to visit the island .
 U.S. Ambassador Adlai E Stevenson, U. Thant, and Soviet deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov . hours beforehand .
 The ExComm discussions for October 26 and 27 indicate a dearth of faith that the Soviets would halt construction on their Cuban missile sites .
 All U.S. calls that they do so, even temporarily, had been futile . All United States calls for them to do so are futile, even temporary .
 The only hope for a cessation of missile activity lay in negotiations involving Thant’s good ofﬁces . For many ExComm participants, the only hope is in negotiations with Thant .
 Thant’s efforts were providing hope to the United States side . Numerous excerpts from the ExComm discussions clearly indicate how much Thant's efforts provided hope .
 Secretary Rusk wanted to wait in order to give Thant more time to give him more time . When discussion on the morning of October 26 turned to the question of whether the U.S. should prohibit POL from entering Cuba, thus tightening the quarantine and escalating the crisis, Rusk
 Stevenson outlined the U.S. preconditions to such negotiations at the morning ExComm meeting of October 26 . Stevenson: "The United States is not interested in such negotiations"
 The other side is going to be very resistant to UN inspectors coming into Cuba . This will involve a considerable effort on the part of the Secretary General, even if the Soviets and Cubans accept it .
 Medium Range Ballistic Missiles in Cuba were becoming fully operational and readied for imminent use . At an intelligence brieﬁng later that afternoon, it was concluded that the missiles were fully operational .
 The ExComm did not know that some missiles were already operational . Apparently, some missiles are already operational.
 Ambassador Stevenson met with Thant in the secretary general’s thirty-eighth ﬂoor UN ofﬁce . Ambassador Stevenson and Thant met in the afternoon of October 26 .
 If the Soviets agreed to no further arms shipments to Cuba, no further work on the missile sites, and rendered the existing missile sites inoperable in forty-eight hours, then there could be two or three weeks for negotiations .
 Stevenson and Thant discussed possible arrangements for veriﬁcation, but Thant did not think the Soviets or Cubans would accept the U.S. demands, 82 .
 Thant says a deal could be reached by trading an American guarantee of the territorial integrity of Cuba for the dismantling and removal of all Cuba’s missile sites and offensive weapons . Thant: A deal could also be reached if the U.S. guarantees of Cuba's territorial integrity
 If this is true, it is a case of Kennedy using the mediator to present proposals to his opponent to render them more palatable . Kennedy and Khrushchev may have used the same use of the same mediator, writes Peter Bergen .
 Khrushchev wanted a way out of the crisis that would protect Cuba, according to Thant . It would indicate he wanted to test the viability of a proposal . Thant's proposal would have been a way of avoiding the crisis .
 Thant saw that this idea offered a quick and simple solution to the crisis and tenaciously pressed it . Whatever the Soviet involvement, Thant was tenacious and tenacious .
 Stevenson advanced the idea to Stevenson . He even telephoned Secretary of State Rusk directly to press the idea with him .
 U.S. agreed to a standstill that met all United States conditions only for American agreement not to attack Cuba during the two or three weeks of negotiation . This time he described it as trading a veriﬁed standstill .
 The formula, made public by Thant two days earlier in his Security Council speech,92 and now being vigorously advanced by him as a potential solution, would soon become the backbone of the settlement . This formula, ﬁrst made public two days before, was made public in
 Kennedy convinced Khrushchev might accept such an agreement . Kennedy was convinced that the agreement would be accepted . Kennedy's decision was made after a series of developments .
 On October 26, Alexander Fomin, a KGB operative whose real name was Alexandre Feklisov, met with John Scali, an ABC journalist with State Department contacts . Fomin met with Scali in a meeting with ABC journalist who had contacts with the State Department . F
 Scali reported to Rusk that the Soviets were interested in removing all offensive weapons in Cuba for a U.S. pledge not to invade it . Thant proposed to both Stevenson and Rusk .
 Rusk told the president, who at 6:30 pm that evening mentioned the possibility to British Prime Minister Macmillan . Rusk said the president told the British prime minister that the possibility was possible .
 President Dorticos’s speech is quoted in Thant, View from the UN, 464. This part of the speech was quoted in a book published by the UN .
 Two days later, on October 28, Thant did in fact announce a trip to Cuba . Thant said he would travel to Cuba on October 31 .
 Khrushchev also restated that he accepted U Thant’s earlier proposals regarding the nonshipment of armaments to Cuba during a period of negotiations . Khrushchchev also said he accepted the earlier proposals during negotiations .
 Khrushchev's message, backed by Fomin’s remarks to Scali and Thant, enabled the ExComm participants to retire that night with cautious optimism . Fomin presented this suggestion not only to Stevenson but also to Rusk .
 ExComm began with concern about a ship under Soviet charter, the Grozny, which was approaching the quarantine line . It began for ExComm with concern that the ship under Russian charter was approaching quarantine .
 President Kennedy asked Thant to convey a message to the Soviets telling them exactly where the quarantine line was being drawn . President Kennedy decided to deal with the Grozny by asking Thant .
 Khrushchev’s proposal of the night before. Then came news that shattered the optimism created by the proposal . The proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union, but the U.S. remained hopeful .
 Reuters broadcast that Moscow had announced it would withdraw Soviet missiles from Cuba if the United States withdrew its rockets from Turkey . Reuters was broadcasting that Moscow was now broadcasting that the U.S. would withdraw its missiles if it withdrew its missiles from Turkey if it withdraws them from Cuba .
 This shocked ExComm, since Khrushchev’s proposal of the night before had made no 94 . Khrushches' proposal had been rejected by ExComm .
 The passage in which the prime minister suggests U Thant might go to Cuba and makes the comparison to Hammarskjöld is on page 481 . The prime minister suggested that he might visit Cuba .
 Part of the dilemma concerning withdrawal of U.S. missiles from Turkey was that the Turks would not acquiesce . Certainly part of the problem is that the Turkish would not accept the withdrawal .
 President Obama says the missiles are not militarily useful . He says he tried to get the missiles out of there last year, but they are still not useful .
 Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend massive air strike against Cuba on October 28 or 29 . President Obama is expected to order a massive strike on Cuba in coming days .
 U-2 was missing, and other American pilots reported being shot at over Cuba . These developments increased the confusion in ExComm. ExComm .
 President Kennedy’s immediate response was to prepare a message to Thant asking if he could get assurances from the Soviet Union that work on the missile sites had ceased . President Kennedy asked Thant to get assurances that work had stopped .
 He wanted this message, which was sent to Stevenson for transmission to Thant that day, to state that discussion about 101 was about 101 . Thant wanted the discussion to be about 101. He wanted it to reflect that discussion .
 Llewellyn Thompson mused that Khrushchev had written the earlier cable of October 26 himself and sent it without clearance . Thompson: "Krushchev may have written the cable himself" The cable was sent without clearance from the government .
 He stated, “We don’t want the Soviet Union or the United Nations to be able to say that the United States rejected it”112 and “this trade has appeal.” 112 .
 Khrushchev’s earlier cable of October 26 called only for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba in exchange for a Soviet withdrawal of its missiles from Cuba, with no reference to Turkey . It was decided to accept the proposal outlined in the cable .
 This approach ignored Khrushchev’s most recent cable of October 27, which added the removal of the U.S. missiles in Turkey to the bargain . This approach is ignored, says the former Soviet leader .
 Discussion was interrupted by the terrible news that an American U-2 had been shot down over Cuba and its pilot killed . The pilot was killed in the crash .
 There was considerable support for knocking out a Soviet SAM site, but Kennedy did not give the order . The decision was postponed to that evening .
 Robert Kennedy and Sorensen left the meeting and wrote the letter to Khrushchev . The president approved the letter, and the president approved it .
 The president’s brother, Robert, was to personally deliver the letter to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin that evening . The letter was delivered by Robert's brother Robert .
 What happened at that meeting between Robert Kennedy and Dobrynin remains a romanticized part of the crisis . Robert Kennedy was assassinated in March 1968 .
 It is now known that Robert did offer, on behalf of the president, to remove the U.S. Jupiter missiles from Turkey, though with the provision that this be kept an absolute secret from all parties . Robert offered to remove missiles with the condition that this was kept secret .
 Stevenson’s rejection of the missile trade now is of interest because at the beginning of the crisis he proposed it . Stevenson's rejection of missile trade was of interest as it was proposed before the crisis began .
 Ted Sorensen, who edited Robert Kennedy’s book Thirteen Days after his assassination, admitted years later in 1989 that he had twisted the truth . The book's editor later admitted that he'd twisted the story .
 Robert Kennedy’s “diary was very explicit that this was part of the deal; at that time it was still a secret even on the American side, except for the six of us who had been present at that meeting . He said Robert Kennedy's ‘diary
 Khrushchev thought U.S. military readiness was a factor in his decision to pull troops out of the Soviet Union . The U.N. was in the midst of a crisis in the Cold War .
 On October 26, he learned that the Pentagon had moved U.S. forces from DEFCON 5, peacetime status, to DeFCON 2, just one away from war . United States hospitals had been ordered to prepare to receive casualties .
 Kennedy dictated his long letter to Kennedy proposing a peaceful solution based on a U.S. noninvasion pledge for withdrawal of Soviet missiles . He sent instructions to accept Thant’s proposal to avoid a confrontation at the quarantine line .
 Khrushchev came to believe that he could get more out of the United States and changed his proposal to include the Turkish missiles in the deal . The next day, October 27, he changed his offer to include Turkish missiles .
 CNN's John Sutter says he was deeply concerned about an American invasion in October . But then, on October 28, he again became concerned about the invasion .
 Castro was reporting that an American U-2 had been shot down over Cuba, and an invasion was almost inevitable . Castro reported that an invasion of Cuba was almost certain after the attack .
 Dobrynin's ominous description of his discussion with Robert Kennedy reinforced Khrushchev’s decision, as did the assurance that the U.S. missiles would be withdrawn from Turkey . It is evident that both Khrushvic and Kennedy were affected by their perceptions of their opponent�
 The parties employed Thant as a mediator to convey proposals to their opponent as his own, to save face, and to provide support . Thant's proposals to the opponent were not his own .
 This proves that the U.S. side did explicitly agree to remove its Jupiter missiles from Turkey as part of the deal, even if it was with the insistence that it be kept a secret from all parties . Kennedy to Khrushchev wanted the deal to remain a personal undertaking by Kennedy
 He was to give the message to Thant after a signal from Rusk, notably in the event of a Soviet rejection of a covert trade of missiles . The message was to be given to Thants in the case of a rejection of the Soviet rejection .
 The message requested Thant to propose the missile trade at the United Nations . Thant requested the proposal at the U.N. request .
 This would have made it easier for Kennedy to publicly accept trading the Turkish missiles, for it would have been seen as part of a UN proposed agreement backed by world opinion . Khrushchev also would have rejected the deal, which also made it more difﬁcult for Kh
 This indicates how far Kennedy was prepared to go to avoid war, and how creatively he intended to use the mediator to propose a solution at the U.N. and achieve a peaceful outcome .
 On October 28, Washington received the news of Khrushchev’s acceptance of the U.S. proposal . The proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union on October 28 .
 They recommended an air strike the next day followed by an invasion unless there was ‘irrefutable evidence’ that dismantling had begun . Thant announced he would go to Havana to try to secure Castro’s consent .
 On October 26, he sent a cable urging Castro to suspend work on the missile facilities while negotiations were under way . The cable was sent to Castro's office on October 26 .
 Castro replied on October 27, stating that Cuba was prepared to accept these compromises only if the United 128 . Castro replied that Cuba would only accept the compromises if the U. 128 .
 Castro invited Thant to visit Cuba for direct discussions, which Thant quickly accepted . The U.S.-Soviet understanding of October 28 angered Castro .
 The UN inspection and veriﬁcation principles adopted by the superpowers now required implementation in Cuba . Cuba is one of the most isolated countries in the world .
 Castro’s consent and cooperation was necessary, but in his rage he now demanded measures . Castro was necessary to have his consent but now he is angry and demanding new measures .
 Thant’s ﬁrst meeting with Castro in Havana on October 30 was discouraging . Thant: “I’m not sure what I’ve done with Castro. It’ll be a good thing for Thant,” he said
 Thant made a strong plea for UN supervision of the dismantling of the missile sites, as agreed by Khrushchev . Thant stressed the United States pledge to lift the blockade and not take military action .
 Castro reiterates his vitriolic accusations against the United States . Castro refused to accept any UN supervision, dismissing it as an unacceptable invasion of sovereignty .
 Good news awaited Thant upon returning to the villa where he was staying . Thant was greeted with a smile when he returned to his villa .
 The Soviet ambassador to Cuba brought the Soviet general in charge of the missile installations to Cuba to explain the signiﬁcant dismantling efforts under way . The general also gave a briefing on dismantling efforts .
 The Soviets invited Thant to visit a missile site, but Thant declined, on Rikhye’s advice, saying that the verbal reassurances were sufﬁcient . The next morning, Thant met Castro again, this time accompanied only by his interpreter .
 Castro was bitter and told the secretary general that he was going to broadcast his account of the crisis . Castro was still bitter and said he wanted to speak out . Castro said he was not happy with the situation in Cuba .
 Castro promised to delete from his speech criticizing Khrushchev for agreeing to UN inspection of missile sites . At Thant’s urging, Castro agreed to delete the parts . Castro promised the speech to be deleted .
 Castro would not agree to allow Thant to leave behind one or two UN aides for direct liaison between Cuba and the U.N. secretary general . Castro would also not agree that Thant would leave behind a few aides for the Cuban government .
 General Rikhye later passed the pilot’s remains to United States authorities . United States pilot who had been shot down on October 27 was shot down in Russia .
 Ambassador Valerian Zorin, Vasily Kuznetsov; John McCloy; Anastas Mikoyan ; U Thant; and Ambassador Adlai Stevenson. Ambassador Adr. Stevenson .
 Rikhye . led Cleveland to conclude, “how extremely useful to American foreign policy the UN could be if we were skillful about it.”
 The United States regarded them as “offensive” and wanted them removed, while the Soviets insisted they had been a gift to Cuba that Castro refused to return . The U.S. regarded the United States as ‘offensive’ and sought them removed .
 The October 28 informal agreement between the leaders still needed to be codiﬁed in more of a more of an of-cial fashion . Also the October 28 agreement still needs codi ﬁcial fashion, the White House says .
 In the two months that followed there were many meetings, some of them facilitated by Thant . Thant: "In the past two months there have been many meetings"
 Thant shuttled back and forth between the two negotiating teams or hosted the teams in his thirty-eighth ﬂoor conference room . Though little is known about them, they initially took place in Secretariat .
 Moscow pressured Castro to accept UN teams on its territory . To the Soviets, UN inspectors were certainly preferable to U.S. ones .
 Thant originated the idea of using ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) personnel to inspect Soviet ships at sea . Thant used ICRC personnel to examine Soviet ships .
 Both superpowers initially agreed to a pullout without UN inspectors . It removed the immediate impasse regarding how to verify the missile pullout .
 Another possibility was using observers from Central American countries . Another possibility considered was using observer teams from Central America .
 Thant’s efforts in this regard kept the negotiations alive by providing reassurance that veriﬁcation would take place . Thant: “I’m sure it will take place,” said Thant .
 Veriﬁcation was accomplished at sea by United States ships and planes, which came near Soviet vessels . The canvas covers over the missiles were removed to allow them to be counted .
 UN-sponsored talks worked out at UN talks, where the Soviets also shared information about their ship departures .
 Castro ﬁnally told Thant that he would agree to the removal of the IL-28 bombers . After extensive negotiations, on November 19, he agreed to remove the bombers from the U.S.
 The next day Kennedy announced Khrushchev’s decision to remove the IL-28 bombers and ordered the quarantine lifted . Kennedy announced the next day that the quarantine had been lifted . The quarantine was lifted .
 In an effort to formalize the agreement between the leaders, the “UN negotiations” produced a draft protocol and an American draft declaration on “the settlement of the Missile Crisis,” as well as several draft joint statements . These were never signed, despite pressure from Kh
 General General Rikhye stated this in an interview with the authors on October 15, 2006 . General Rakhye said this in a statement made in October 2006 .
 U Thant’s military attaché, General Rikhye, has conﬁrmed, in an interview on October 15, 2006, with the authors, that U. Thant did originate this idea . Also, U . Thant's military attacher,
 U Thant was unanimously elected to an extended term as secretary-general on November 30 . He is the first member of the U.N. Security Council to be elected to extended term .
 The story of the Cuban missile crisis, including the multifarious activities of the secretary general and ExComm reactions to his initiatives, shows that Thant had a signiﬁcant impact on both parties . Thant also had a multifarious impact on ExComm reaction to his
 He inﬂenced their thinking, negotiating positions, stance towards the use of force, and proclivity to accept a proposal, including the non-invasion deal .
 When Thant took his bold initiative in this crisis, it was at the bequest of the smaller, newer, and neutral members of the United Nations, organized in making their appeal to him by the representative of Cyprus .
 Both the United States and the USSR initially resisted Thant’s appeal . Ironically, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union initially resisted his appeal .
 Nobody foresaw that it would help effect a Soviet retreat on the high seas . Nobody predicted it would be a success for the Soviet Union .
 In the aftermath of this crisis, many attributed Kennedy’s success to his resolve and strength . Kennedy's success was attributed to his strength, resolve and resolve .
 Of equal importance was his rare recognition of the need to provide his opponent with an honorable alternative and of the utility of a skilled intermediary .
 The explicit instructions handed to Thant by Stevenson on October 25 detailed exactly what the Americans wanted Thant to send to Khrushchev as his own proposal, or how they wanted to play a classic third-party role .
 This act, initiated by Kennedy, transformed the crisis by making Thant its mediator . Thant is now a key figure in the government's response to the crisis in Syria .
 An interesting lesson emerges from this conﬂict is how a mediator’s offer to assist may be initially rejected by one or both of the parties but then renunciation of an invasion of Cuba . The lesson is that an offer of assistance may be rejected by both parties
 The Cuban missile crisis clearly indicates that initial rejections of the mediator should not be construed as ﬁnal, for they can indeed be reversed when calmer minds prevail . Initial rejections are not always construed as  rejected as they can be reversed .
 The enormous signiﬁcance of the messages echoes in Stevenson’s words that ‘the Secretary General’�s intervention led to the diversion of the Soviet ships headed for Cuba and interception by our Navy. “The Secretary General.” Stevenson�
 Kennedy’s own words at ExComm indicate that he exercised restraint because he chose to wait for Khrushchev's response to Thant's second appeal rather than take military action . Kennedy's own words indicate that .
 Kennedy decided not to escalate the conﬂict because he retained hope in Thant’s efforts . This restraint continued afterwards when, on numerous occasions, Kennedy decided to stay calm . Kennedy's restraint continued after Thant's arrest, he said .
 Frequent reference to Thant during the ExComm discussions indicate the extent to which Thant’s efforts dissuaded the United States from escalating the conﬂict. Frequent references to Thants indicate the U.S. was dissuaded by his efforts .
 The United States did not add POL to the quarantined items or use ﬂares for night surveillance because of hopes that the U.S. might secure Soviet cooperation .
 When the Grozny was approaching the demarcation line, Kennedy asked Thant to convey the exact location of the line to the Soviets . Kennedy, rather than ordering the boarding of this ship, instead of ordering it to be boarded, he asked the Soviets to find out the exact
 Kennedy asked Thant to get assurances from the Soviets that work on the missile sites in Cuba had stopped . Khrushchev's new demand for withdrawal of American missiles from Turkey .
 Thant single-mindedly advanced the noninvasion proposal that became the centerpiece of the ﬁnal settlement . Thant: "Noninvasion" proposal was the proposal that led to the settlement .
 Khrushchev used Thant as a means to indirectly introduce an initiative, as did Kennedy . Possibly he did this at Khrushshev’s request, which would indicate that Khrushchev used this as a way of introducing an initiative . Possibly this would indicate Khrush
 Leaders both recognized that agreeing to a proposal from a mediator would be more acceptable than backing down to an opponent . In any case, the leaders both agreed to a compromise .
 Whatever the Soviet role may have been in the proposal, it gave the noninvasion pledge salience in the negotiating process . The proposal was made by the secretary general .
 He proposed it early in the October 24 Security Council meeting . He personally telephoned Secretary Rusk, an exceptional move, to press for it .
 Adlai Stevenson testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1963 . Stevenson's testimony was held before the Committee on International Organization Affairs . Stevenson spoke before the committee .
 The signiﬁcance of all this lies in the fact that when Thant presented the “noninvasion for missiles” trade, the Americans were still pressing for prolonged negotiations of several weeks before a freeze of Cuban missile activity .
 The Americans simply could not foresee a much faster way out of the crisis than arduous negotiations with the missiles frozen in place . The U.S. simply couldn't foresee a better way out .
 The Thant formula saw the missile sites dismantled in mere days . Thant was on hand in Cuba to get ﬁrst-hand reports of the progress .
 As early as October 26, Rusk, Kennedy, and even the British prime minister were thinking of the possibility of Thant leading a mission to Cuba well before Castro invited him . Rusk: Pressure was mounting because Americans believed the missile sites were approaching operational readiness .
 They had come to appreciate the mediator’s enormous utility, and their strategy involved him extensively . The mediator was a key figure in the Obama administration's efforts to win back control of the world .
 Mediated conﬂicts are of many types and involve varying degrees of mediator activity . Mediated constrations occuriate conventionals are of various types of mediators .
 A mediator may also play a less formalized role that does not control all communications but that nevertheless effects signiﬁcant change in the negotiations .
 "He facilitated face-saving and de-escalation, transmitted messages, fostered conﬁdence, made proposals, and affected the negotiations profoundly," he said .
 Pravda began to signal on October 26 the Soviet readiness to make a deal, it quoted the full text of Thant's letter to Khrushchev on the front page .
 A highly respected mediator assisted the parties in pulling back from the brink . The inﬂuence of a highly respected mediationator helped pull back from brink of collapse .
 The faith of the parties in U Thant is evident in their discussions, their requests to him, and his many successful initiatives, says U. Thant . The faith in the parties is evident, he says .
 To view the Cuban missile crisis simply as a victory of U.S. military might is a false and incomplete interpretation of the conﬂict. It is not a victory for the United States military might .
 Kennedy gave his opponent an honorable way out, and skillfully used a mediator to do so despite advice to the contrary . This is not only because of the signiﬁcant effect that Thant had upon the protagonists, but also because he skillfully provided an honorable
 His victory lay in exercising restraint, even to the point of refusing to give orders to Soviet antiaircraft installations that had shot down an American plane . He made concessions based on the mediator’s suggestions .
 Many of the ofﬁcials condemned Thant’s message and tried to prevent him from mediating the crisis . One of the great ironies is that at the outset of this crisis, many of the . of the greatest ironies was that many of them condemned
