 They’ve paid less attention to how little we knew about the Soviets’ true intentions, they say .
 Donald Trump tweets about his “Nuclear Button” being “much bigger & more powerful” than Kim Jong Un’s . The tweet is another double-joke about the North Korean dictator’�s ‘Nuclear button’
 The second cliche is to juxtapose the leaders involved in today’s nuclear standoff with those who managed the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 . The U.S. and North Korea are at odds in the nuclear standoff .
 President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev saved the world from nuclear devastation . The situation today is much more dangerous because President Trump and Supreme Leader Kim are less judicious .
 Leaders in a nuclear showdown inevitably lack sufficient information about each other’s military capabilities, intentions and perceptions . Much of what they think they know is probably wrong, and much of it probably wrong .
 Given how little the U.S. and North Korea understand about one another, that should worry us . And given how little little the United States and N. Korea understand each other, that's worrying .
 On October 22, Kennedy announced this discovery on television and said that he would impose a naval “quarantine” of Cuba in two days . Kennedy announced the discovery on October 22 and said he would imposing a naval "quarantine"
 Top military, intelligence, diplomatic and White House officials were now working around the clock to prepare options for the president . This meant a massive U.S. nuclear attack on the USSR and its Eastern European satellite countries .
 Kennedy secretly tape-recorded the meetings in the Cabinet Room and the Oval Office . Kennedy secretly taped the meetings .
 The tapes reveal military leaders pressing Kennedy to authorize an invasion . Kennedy calmly asks questions and reminds everyone of the consequences of a nuclear war .
 U.S. Air Force and CIA planes were flying high and low over Cuba to glean intelligence on the Soviet missile buildup . They were preparing plans for attacking key installations and invading the island .
 The president dispatched his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to meet secretly with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin at the Justice Department . That evening, Robert Kennedy met with the ambassador at Justice Department, the president's brother .
 The first demand was that the Soviets begin removing missiles within 48 hours, or the U.S. would attack them . The United States would attack the Soviets if they did not remove the missiles .
 The second demand, which long remained secret, was that firing on American reconnaissance planes must end immediately . The demand was that the firing of U.S. reconnaissance aircraft must end .
 Daniel Ellsberg’s notes from the study he conducted of the crisis for the Department of Defense . The attorney general declared, “If one more plane was shot at, we wouldn’t just attack the site that had fired at it; we would take out all
 American officials assumed Khrushchev had authorized the anti-air firing on U.S. planes . The incident occurred during the Cold War .
 Cuban personnel were conducting operations under the direction of Fidel Castro . In fact, however, Fidel Castro was behind the operations .
 Castro feared an imminent invasion and ordered his anti-aircraft personnel to fire on American planes . On Saturday morning, the 27th, Castro feared the invasion of the U.S.
 Some Soviet operators were carried away by the example of their Cuban comrades and ignored orders not to fire without the express authorization of the Soviet general in charge in Cuba .
 Ellsberg: SAM commander ordered the firing that downed the U-2 plane on Saturday . This turned out to be the case with the local SAM commander, who ordered the shooting . The story is based on much later scholarly research .
 The Kennedy brothers had issued an ultimatum that other American officials did not know about, and which they could not confirm Khrushchev received . In other words, the Kennedy brothers' ultimumumum was issued by the brothers' brother . The brothers were not able to confirm
 The Kennedys did not consider that Castro and his forces were acting independently, and therefore that their immediate ultimatum would not reach this key actor, whether or not he would heed it . Castro's forces are acting independently .
 Signals were being sent assuming they would be received and acted upon by the right actors, but U.S. leaders didn't know that they did not know who the right actor was or that the messages were being received as intended .
 These smaller, battlefield-oriented nuclear weapons were to defend against an expected Marine invasion by the U.S. The weapons were designed to protect against a Marine invasion .
 Local Soviet officers were pre-authorized to use them against an American invasion force . Prior to October 22, local Soviet officers had been authorized to use the weapons .
 The Kennedy brothers mistakenly thought that the only nuclear-related forces on Cuba were mediumand intermediate-range missiles . Intelligence assets were searching for those missiles’ corresponding nuclear warheads, but they had not been able to locate them .
 The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons was unknown, and the delegation to use them was unimaginable to U.S. intelligence analysts and leaders .
 Had another American plane been hit, the U.S. probably would have responded first by bombing missile installations .
 Kennedy and the military planned that the United States would begin an invasion of Cuba . Depending on how Castro and his forces reacted, the U.S. military planned an invasion .
 McNamara told Kennedy that there were “about 8 to 10,000” Soviet “personnel, probably military personnel” in Cuba . The military found the idea of invasion desirable, or at least feasible .
 As it turned out, this was an ‘unknown known’ — a thing American leaders thought they knew but did not . As well as this, this is an unknown known, it was a thing U.S. leaders knew but didn't .
 The Soviets actually had far more troops on the island—42,000, which was not revealed until 2008 . The Soviets had more than 42,000 troops, which were revealed in 2008 .
 If Kennedy had assented to his generals’ constant pressure to invade Cuba, the higher-than-known Soviet troop numbers likely would have made the landing and ground war much more difficult to win . If Kennedy hadn’t invaded Cuba, he would have faced a more difficult landing
 This, in turn, would have created even greater pressure on Kennedy to escalate in order to avoid a politically devastating defeat . This would have led to even more pressure on the president to take action .
 Such escalation would have then probably driven the Cubans/Soviets to use some of these nuclear weapons against invading forces . Such escalation likely would have led to the use of some of the weapons by the Soviet-Cuban forces .
 American officials would have assumed that Khrushchev had authorized this use of nuclear weapons . American officials assumed this would have been the result of the use of such weapons .
 The United States’ nuclear plans then called for unleashing most of the more than 18,000 nuclear weapons the U.S. military deployed in 1962, against the Soviet bloc and China . In 1962, the United States deployed most of its nuclear weapons against China and the Soviet Union
 No one should believe that a U.S. force could have attacked by tactical nuclear warheads without responding with nuclear warheads . It would have been an absolute disaster for the world, he says .
 Similar harrowing developments were also occurring at sea, even in the days after the crisis seemingly had ended . Similar harrowing events also occurred at sea even after it seemed to have ended .
 Soviet submarines patrolling around Cuba were equipped with nuclear-armed torpedoes, unbeknownst to U.S. officials . In brief, Soviet submarines around Cuba had nuclear-armored torpedoes .
 When American vessels dropped depth charges, commanders thought they were under attack . U.S. submarines thought the depth charges were being used to signal them to surface . Submarine commanders thought it was an attack .
 Two crews prepared to launch their nuclear-armed torpedoes against American ships, but for different reasons ultimately withheld firing . Two of the crews were at risk of being shot at American ships .
 These crews were reprimanded for not heroically violating orders and firing . When they returned to Russia after the crisis, Russia reprimanded them for not firing .
 None of this was known by Americans until decades after the crisis . Americans didn't find out about the crisis until decades later .
 It's extremely difficult to know how foreign adversaries perceive their situation and calculate their moves . Key targets of intelligence do not reveal their inner thoughts in phone calls, texts and emails that can be intercepted .
 The United States and other governments know that North Korea has nuclear weapons that work . The U.S. and other countries know that N. Korea has a nuclear weapon that works that works .
 North Korea has tested a variety of missiles whose ranges range from 50 to 8,000 miles . North Korea tested a range of missiles with ranges ranging from 50-8,000-miles .
 The numbers and reliabilities of the various types, again, are uncertain . The numbers are uncertain, but the numbers are still uncertain .
 Outsiders and Kim Jong Un do not know whether nuclear warheads mounted on longer-range missiles would detonate as planned . Outsiders say it is not known whether warheads will detonate in North Korea .
 The U.S. cannot be certain that its ballistic missile defenses can knock out North Korea’s long-range missiles . The United States has never been tested in wartime conditions . North Korea has never tested its missile defenses in wartime .
 Experts swiftly debunked that claim, and the Pentagon did not defend it . The Pentagon has been criticized for its handling of the situation .
 The risk of nuclear conflict could be greater than it should otherwise be . But if the president really believes it, or the North Koreans believe it, then the risk of a nuclear war is greater .
 The president could be emboldened to strike North Korea, believing that missile defenses would limit its ability to retaliate . The president believes that missile defense would limit North Korea's ability to strike .
 Kim could back down for the same reason, or expand his nuclear arsenal and seek other means of delivery, for example, via cargo ships in South Korea, Japanese or American ports .
 Intelligence on the perceptions, thinking and behavioral tendencies of North Korea’s leadership is even cloudier than regarding its military capabilities . Intelligence is cloudier on North Korean leadership's thinking and behavior than military capabilities, experts say .
 Senior U.S. military officials privately acknowledge they have very little insight into how Kim would react to military actions or diplomatic negotiating positions . Senior United States military officials say they have little insight on how Kim and his inner circle would react .
 Senior officials in the current administration and its predecessors say that less is known about North Korea than any other adversary . North Korea is one of the most secretive countries in the world .
 North Koreans struggle to predict what Trump will do, according to recent interlocutors with North Korean officials . Meanwhile, North Koreans are unsure what the U.S. president will do .
 The U.S. is contemplating and preparing for strikes against North Korea if it conducts another test of an intercontinental ballistic missile or a nuclear weapon .
 The idea, according to credible reports, is not to undertake or signal a war to remove the North Korean regime . The idea is to demonstrate the United States’ seriousness and to compel Kim to stop such provocations, reports say .
 It behooves leaders in the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, the White House and Congress to learn from pertinent history and ask what could go wrong if North Korea has more or different weaponry .
 Similar out-of-the-box thinking should be applied to how South Korean officials, military crews and society will act if conflict begins, experts say . The South Korean military and South Korean society should be prepared for conflict .
 American officials cannot control whether their North Korean counterparts conduct similar analyses of their own assessments of U.S. capabilities, intentions and likely behaviors .
 Maybe they will conclude that the wisest course is to avoid a conflict they cannot win, or maybe they will not . Maybe they'll decide to avoid conflict they can't win or maybe not .
 Fidel Castro urged Khrushchev to initiate nuclear war with the U.S. in Cuba in 1962, preferring national suicide to an American invasion and overthrow of his government . Castro was a young and deeply ideological Fidel Castro in 1962 .
 It will be left for historians in 50 years to determine whether the antagonists were lucky or unlucky, wise or unwise . Historians will be able to determine if they were lucky, unlucky or unlucky .
