 The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency verified that covert Soviet nuclear missiles were stationed in Cuba, a Sovietallied, communist nation situated 90 miles from the United States coastline . Cuba was a Soviet-backed communist nation .

 On October 22nd, 1962, President Kennedy presented a speech describing the nuclear arms buildup in Cuba . The speech was presented by President Kennedy .
 Historians have very different interpretations of this act of brinkmanship’s justifiability . Historians are divided on whether or not the act was justifiable .
 This essay will analyze the different perspectives surrounding this question, leading to the author’s own conclusion . The author of this essay concludes that the answer is yes, yes .
 This is because the Cuban nuclear weapons may have been installed by the Soviet Union purely to defend Cuba’s security and government . This is believed to have been done to defend the Cuban government and its security .
 During the crisis, President Kennedy was presented with this explanation, however, he rejected it . President Kennedy rejected it during the crisis .
 Kennedy also expressed his definition of the word “offensive weapon” in this speech . In doing so, he depicted the Cuban weapons as being a threat to U.S. security .
 President Kennedy emphasized the “offensive” characteristics of the Cuban missiles in 1962 . President Kennedy said in his address to the U.S. public on the 22nd of October, 1962, President Kennedy .
 In fact, the word “offensive” was repeated 13 times throughout this speech .
 The U.S. was insistent on expressing to the American general public that the missiles were intended to serve an undeniably offensive purpose . As these extracts of the speech reveal, the U.K. insisted to the public that they were not intended to be offensive .

 Historical source is limited by its purpose to persuade . However, it is also important to note that this historical source is only limited to its use to persuade.
 This results in only Gaddis’s limited perspective of the crisis being presented, when this subject is open to different interpretations . This is a limited perspective on the crisis, when it is open-to-different interpretations .
 An understanding of what motivated Khrushchev to provide Cuba with missiles and why Castro was willing to agree to this controversial plan, will be explored in this section of the essay . The essay provides a deeper insight into the Post-Revisionist historiographical perspective of the crisis .
 The U.S. government remained determined to limit Castro’s acts to very specific guidelines . Castro's acts were limited to specific guidelines, according to the government .
 Historian, John Swift, suggests that Castro viewed this intervention as ‘a barrier for Cuba overcoming it’s domestic issues’ , motivating the Cuban leader to halt the USA’�s interference in Cuban affairs .
 Castro achieved this by nationalizing U.S. owned land and businesses within Cuba . Castro nationalized the land and business within Cuba in order to nationalize it .
 The nation previously assured “a market for half of Cuba's sugar crops and two-thirds of its foreign exchange” , was no longer consuming Cuban products . The nation no longer consumes Cuban products.
 Assistance from the Soviet Union was able to soften the negative economic toll this had on Cuba . The Soviet Union provided assistance to Cuba in the 1950s .
 The USA’s desire to contain communism outside of the United States is exhibited through examples, such as the announcement of the ‘Truman Doctrine’ in March, 1947, which proclaimed the U.S. would provide aid to nations attempting to resist communism .
 These aggressive acts provoked Cuba to seek diplomatic assistance from the UN in July of 1960 . Cuba sought the UN's help in the wake of the attacks .
 CIA-trained Cuban refugees were sent into Cuba to incite a political uprising to deposit Cuba’s communist government . The Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 was the result of the CIA's false words of assurance that Cuba would not be invaded .
 The U.S. President was determined to keep the White House’s involvement in the engineering of this attack strictly covert . The White House was determined not to engage in the attack .
 The embarrassment of the Bay of Pigs invasion did not stop U.S. attempts to remove Castro from his position of power . The embarrassment was the result of the invasion of Cuba .
 Operation Mongoose aims to initiate revolution via establishing bases for guerrilla action, sabotaging Castro’s military and spreading anti-Castro propaganda to reduce popularity towards the Cuban regime . Primary sources, such as a CIA summaries of the objectives of the operation, highlight the CIA’
 Reports also reveal attempts to assassinate Castro and significant members of his government . Castro's government was overthrown by the CIA in 1961 .
 Krushchev’s desire to supply Cuba with protective armaments was re-affirmed on multiple occasions . The Soviet Union wanted to supply the Cuban nation with protective armsaments .
 Cuban President Dorticós’ address to the U.N. General Assembly in October of 1962 is one of many examples of the Cuban President's address .
 Cuban representative affirmed that if we were attacked, we would defend ourselves . Cuban representative said: "If we are attacked we will defend ourselves. In this meeting the Cuban representative .
 On September 11th, 1962, a Soviet government statement was made, clarifying the defensive nature of any weapons within Cuba . Furthermore, on that date, the Soviet government said that any weapons in Cuba were defensive .
 The weapons may have been deployed to serve a purely defensive purpose for Cuba . However, as the aforementioned evidence implies, these weapons may not have been used in the country's defence .
 The aggressive acts of the USA towards Cuba towards Cuba contributed towards Castro’s desire to receive defensive aid . The US destroyed Cuban targets and tried to undermine Castro and his regime .
 The intention of the weapons to defend has also been supported by the statements of Soviet and Cuban spokesmen . The intention is also supported by Soviet and Cuba spokesmen.
 On a side note, it is important to question how accurately Kennedy’s language captured his judgement of the missiles . Kennedy's language was accurate .
 The purpose of the speech was to persuade the U.S. public to support the dangerous policy which the USA was about to pursue . The speech was intended to convince the public of support for the USA's dangerous policy .
 Kennedy's labeling of weapons accurately captured his conviction of the weapons, or whether this was merely a dysphemism which enabled Kennedy to cunningly express a threatening, persuasive message . Because of this purpose, one is left to consider whether Kennedy’s labeling was accurate .
 The limitations of this source should be acknowledged when we make the assumption that Kennedy's claims accurately reflected this political figure's thoughts and emotions . Kennedy’s claims should not be considered accurate .
 John Lewis Gaddis believes that the missiles were placed in Cuba to protect the nation from future attacks from the U.S. He says they were placed there to protect Cuba from future American attacks . The missiles are believed to have been placed to protect Cuban citizens .
 Should the U.S. have succeeded in their attempts to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro, it would have been a significant strike against the communist revolution worldwide . The United States has never succeeded in overthrowing Fidel Castro .
 Khrushchev intended to spread revolution throughout Latin America, says Gaddis . Gaddi believes this was his attempt to achieve this objective .
 Post-Revisionist historians have access to more historical sources compared to Orthodox historians . A point to take into consideration when analyzing Cold War historiography is the advantageous access to historical sources . The Cold War historian's view of the Cold War is critical of the Orthodox Church .
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the historical archives in Russia were accessible for the first time for study and analysis . Russia's historical archives are now accessible to the public for study .
 Post-revisionist historians would have had access to more historical evidence to base their interpretation of history upon .
 Traditionalists would not have had such advantageous access to these previously unavailable materials, which is a limitation of their perspective . Traditionalists have not been able to access the materials previously unavailable .
 Khrushchev had the option to install less provocative, shorter range missiles in Cuba to prevent an invasion of American troops . The option was to install shorter-range missiles to prevent invasion of Cuba .
 Historians view the quarantine which Kennedy enforced as the ‘optimal’ strategy to the intolerable Soviet Missiles in Cuba . The quarantine was the “optimal strategy’s” strategy to deal with the intolerable .
 Orthodox historians have used arguments to rebut Post-Revisionist claims that Soviet missiles were intended solely to defend Cuba . These arguments have been used by Orthodox historians .
 Several restrictions were placed upon those involved in the deployment of the Cuban Missiles to assure the mission remained covert .
 The modern publication date of this source is another advantage as it would have enabled the author access to a larger array of sources when compared to, for example, historians publishing a similar summary in the mid-1900s .
 Since this is written and published by a United States government organization, purposeful omission of particular facts, censorship of content, and patriotic/political bias are all aspects of this source which limit its validity .
 President Kennedy specifically quoted extracts of this report in his address to American public in his October 22nd speech . President John F Kennedy specifically quotes extracts of the report .
 The U.S.A. was adamant that the Soviet Union planned to utilize the weapons in an offensive manner, not a defensive one . Khrushchev attempted to conceal the Cuban missiles, but the U.K.A was adamant .
 Kennedy utilized such evidence to justify his speech on October 26th, 1962 . Kennedy used the evidence to support his speech in 1962 .
 May and Zelikow have addressed this question, believing had of Khrushchev announced his intentions or privately warned Kennedy that he planned to base missiles Cuba, or, there may have been no crisis at all .
 Khrushchev placed intermediate range nuclear missiles in Cuba in an attempt to resist the emerging lead the U.S. was developing in the deployment of strategic missiles . Hershberg believes the move was a response to the growing lead the United States was developing .
 At the beginning of his speech, Kennedy described the characteristics and capabilities of the missiles based in Cuba .
 President Kennedy viewed strategic weapons and strategic warfare as offensive . He would not accept Soviet missiles, especially those deployed in Cuba, proclaiming them to be defensive . President Kennedy believed Soviet missiles were defensive weapons .
 This definition differs from Khrushchev’s who via a telegram addressed to President Kennedy on the 26th of October, 1962, stated in this telegram “These missiles are a means of extermination and destruction”
 "One cannot attack with these missiles...only people, troops, can attack. But one cannot attack ...only people ... can attack," says the author of the book .
 President Kennedy reacted how he did to the discovery of nuclear weapons directed towards the USA . It is important to take the historical context of the crisis into consideration .
 The USA’s geographical location shielded it from major border-related threats and conflict, the author says . The U.S. is located in the United States' most populous region .
 The USA had not experienced many circumstances in which its territory had been directly targeted . Excluding events such as the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor during the Second World War .
 The Soviet Union during the 20th century alone had been exposed to three major wars, all of which negatively impacted the nation . Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was exposed to 3 major wars in the last century .
 Khrushchev's weapons may have been intended to be purely defensive, but this definition did not align with the Kennedy administration . Kennedy administration perceived the characteristics of these long range, extremely dangerous missiles as intended to serve an offensive purpose .
 U.S. President, John F Kennedy, informed the world of the Soviet Union’s deployment of “clearly offensive” nuclear missile bases in Cuba in 1962 .
 President Kennedy's act of brinkmanship was only partially justified . President Kennedy was partially justified by the events surrounding his actions . The events which influenced President Kennedy to conduct this act were analyzed .
 The President did not take into consideration other probable explanations for the missiles’ deployment, he says . This act of brinkmanship was unjustified, he writes .
 Historians Gaddis and Stern argue that the USSR provided Cuba with these weapons to defend the nation . Cuba was given the weapons by the USSR to defend its nation, they argue .
 Cuba’s need for defensive weapons justified in the early 1960s . The USA's attempts to undermine Cuba's communist revolution justified the need for the weapons . The U.S. tried to undermine the communist revolution throughout the early 60s .
 The USSR and Cuban diplomats emphasized that if weapons were to be deployed in Cuba, their purpose would be strictly to defend . In addition to this, the USSR and Cuba diplomats said weapons would only be used to defend themselves .
 President Kennedy mistook these defensive weapons for offensive ones . Despite these multiple indicators, President Kennedy mistakenly mistook them for defensive ones . President Kennedy thought these weapons were defensive weapons .
 The USSR's determination to conceal the nuclear missiles supported Kennedy’s fixed mindset that the weapons were of a threatening nature, hence justifying this act of brinkmanship . Alternatively, as historians Hershberg and authors Ernest R May and Philip D Zelikow suggested, the USSR’
 The characteristics of these nuclear missiles and their damage potential played a key role in Kennedy’s desire to immediately dismantle the nuclear weapons . Kennedy's desire to dismantle nuclear weapons was also a key factor in his decision .
 The Soviet Union and the United States used the word “offensive” very differently to one another . It appears that these two nations defined this term very differently .
 As Sergei Khrushchev argued, the Cuban missile crisis can be viewed as psychologically inflicted crisis . The Cuban Missile Crisis can be seen as a psychological crisis, he says .
 Swift condemns John F Kennedy for letting the attitude towards communism impair his good-judgement . Gaddis exhibits empathy towards the USA, scolding Khrushchev’s lack of consideration for the US's predictable negative reaction to the crisis .
 President Kennedy’s act of brinkmanship of October 26th, 1962, was only partially justified . Taking this evidence and varying historical analyses into consideration, it has been revealed that .
 Khrushchev couldn’t have expected the U.S. not to react to the crisis, especially due to the covert characteristic of the missiles and the USA’s lack of historical direct foreign threats .
 Kennedy’s lack of consideration for alternate explanations for the nuclear weapons was a significant mistake made by the American President during this critical period of Cold War history . However, Kennedy's lack of consideration for alternate explanations, such as the viewpoint of Castro, was a mistake made
