 Cubans emptied out their prisons and drove them to the port of Mariel where they were loaded onto the waiting United States ships . The Cubans were set free in Miama to rob, rape, kill, cheat, and carry on whatever criminal activities had originally landed them in prison .

 Fidel was either his own man, in which case he was a useful idiot, or he was in cahoots with the masters of the Empire of Chaos . So according to you, you were either a useful fool or a traitor to your enemies .
 If the masters of the Empire of Chaos had really wanted him dead – well, they would have had him dead . But obviously, if the masters were really trying to kill him, well- they would've had him killed .
 Cuba is far more capable of defending itself than Cuba ever could have done . The U.S. has often traveled half way around the globe to destroy entire societies, writes CNN.com's John Sutter .
 The masters of the Empire of Chaos didn’t want Fidel dead or Cuba destroyed, but just as he and Cuba were, which proves, according to you, that “e was playing an important part in the layered Realpolitik of the era and the Region,”
 Fidel was pro-capitalist, that is that he was all about granting a certain coterie of individuals the legal right to own everything and to profit thereby at the expense of the Cuban majority . That Fidel and his Cuba were not destroyed proves that Fidel was not destroyed .

 Fidel Castro's Cuba survived as long as he and it did for nothing more than being a low level priority for the hegemon . Maybe Fidel and the Cuba he lead survived as well as he did for just as long .
 Or maybe the U.S. couldn’t actually muster the Cuban compradors it needed to properly manage the island on its behalf . This class of collaborators had been liquidated by the revolution, while elsewhere in the world such collaborators were more aplenty .
 The old order was overturned and a new one put in its place to better serve by orders of magnitude, the Cuban people, a thing this new order has done and continues to do . Despite attempts to economically strangle the island nation, the people have done and continue to do, a
 If Castro was, as you claim, pro-capitalist, the revolution itself wasn’t . Castro was pro-capitalized, but his revolution itself was not . Castro’s revolution was not, as well as the Castro regime, it was a revolution .
 If Castro had persisted in his pro-capitalist aspirations as leader of the revolution, the revolution itself would have sealed his fate long ago . Castro's pro-capitalism aspirations would have led to his downfall long ago, says Castro . Castro had been a leader of Cuba for decades .
 It is far more likely that Fidel faithfully served his mandate as the leader of the revolution heart and soul than duplicitously . Fidel was more likely to serve his mandate, rather than to hide his crimes from the public eye .
 That Cuba stands in defiance of capital is not an illusion, and that Castro stood with Cuba is also not fantasy . That Cuba stood with Castro is not fantasy, it's not fantasy. Cuba stands defiant of capital, it is not illusion .
 Fidel Castro could not have ruled Cuba for as long as he did if he had betrayed his promise to his people . As much as he may have survived, the U.S. didn’t really prioritize his murder, he may not have survived .

 The United States regains influence in Ethiopia for the first time since Selasie’s decline . The USSR dissolves, weakened by that and the quagmire in Afghanistan… the entire episode played out in a classic Brzezinski-Hegelian way .
 Castro very stupidly let his ideology blind him when he threw his military weight behind Mengistu . Or he was playing a deeper game, and helping The Capitalists turn Ethiopia into an exploding cigar that blew up right in Moscow’s face .

 Fidel was a Mole who worked with Capitalist Intelligence Structures as controlled opposition, keeping radical activities South of the U.S. Border under surveillance, diluting Revolutionary efforts in Cuba and the region .

 The Cubans did back Mengistu at first because they saw him as Ethiopia’s best hope among the assemblage of competing forces, but they later regretted their decision when his unsavory aspects became apparent and undeniable .
