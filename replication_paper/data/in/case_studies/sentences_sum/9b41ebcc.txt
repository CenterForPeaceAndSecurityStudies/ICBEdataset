 William Buckley's National Review devoted several issues to exposing and denouncing Kennedy's appeasement . But the Kennedy-Khrushchev deal was a deplorable error resulting in political havoc and human suffering .
 Khrushchev prepared to yank the missiles before any “bullying” by Kennedy . Kennedy was prepared to pull the missiles from the sky . Kennedy's "bullying" was a pre-emptive move .
 The genuine threat came --not from Moscow, but from the Castros and Che, the real threat came from Moscow . The Castros, Che and the Che were the real threats, not Moscow .
 The Coast Guard in Florida got 12 new boats and seven new planes to make sure Castro remained unmolested . JFK's Missile Crisis 'solution' also pledged to pull the rug out of under Cuba's in-house freedom fighters .
