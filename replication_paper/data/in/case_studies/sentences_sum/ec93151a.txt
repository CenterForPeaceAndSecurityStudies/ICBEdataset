 Colorado on the CORNER ASCC meeting last week was excruciatingly painful to all concerned, at least to those who took the time from the details of the meeting to view it .
 The Executive Council argued for some 20 minutes about the possibility of sending the band to the Mines game with various members making comments (usually for the second or third time) about how much was expected from the band .
 Race said he felt the band would add a great deal of spirit to the occasion and should not have to pay the full fare to Mines .
 Parents' Weekend and a Leadership Conference in the spring came before the Council . The Council also discussed the possibility of holding Parents' weekend and Leadership Conference .
 Moe and Levers felt that to hold the latter conference every year would be redundant . Moe, Levers: "To hold the . conference every . year would not be redundant. Moe and
 Followers of one year would be the leaders of the next, and that the followers of that year would lead the next . "They seem to forget that originality might possibly creep into* the program," says author .
 Real seems to feel that his position incurs no responsibility beyond attending a weekly meeting . In a summary, the meeting closed with an earnest plea from Mr Real .

 I want to thank you for letting me help in your campaign. First of all, I'm very happy to be able to help in this campaign. I hope you can help in the future of this campaign .
 "During this process I learned a great deal about the workings of democracy," says David Cameron . He says he learned a lot about democracy during the process .
 "I shall never again feel apathetic about my own vote for the candidates of my choice," she said . "I will never again vote again," she added .
 It is very simple â you decide what candidates or issues you support, and then you work for them with the other people who agree with you . It's very simple to say: You decide what you support and then work with the others who agree .
 Not always on a lofty, abstract plane, but often with mundane activities like stuffing envelopes or making some phone calls .
 You have strengthened your ideas, your political party, your democracy and your treasured way-of-life . Whether your side wins or not, you have strengthened ideas, political parties and democracy .
 Someone said that the strength of a democracy depends on organized opposition . The strength of democracy depends upon organized opposition, the author says .
 In attempting to persuade partisans, both groups stimulate thought and activity in a way which strengthens both sides, as well as the whole idea of democracy .
 I also learned much about the art of campaigning which will be useful in the future, and while working with some of the wonderful people who support you, I made many new friendships .
 We all owe you a debt of gratitude for your insights into the fundamentals of democracy and for your untiring, lifelong efforts to involve us all in exercising the responsibilities and privileges of ""popular sovereignty,"" without which it would wither and die .
 Your enthusiasm, insight and wisdom succeeded in broadening the base on which political decisions rest in our state . Your enthusiasm and wisdom helped broaden the base of our state, says Sen. Tom Steyer .
 In regard to your editorial, of September 30th, in which you stated that it would be of greater benefit to have the editor of the TIGER a voting member of the CUL . We wish to state our reasons for disagreement .
 CUL has a lack of communication to the student body, says the editor of the Tiger . That one of the major defects of CUL is that it has not been communicated to students, he says .
 The editor of the Tiger through virtue of his position and expepeience on the campus could be a greater contribute!to the committee than a freshman who has been on campus only a relatively short time . That the editor of . the Tiger could contribute! to the committee .
 That you as an i n d i v v i d u a 1 grow tired of siting as an ex-officio member on committees without a vote . That's what you need to do to be a member of the House of Representatives . That you can't sit on committees
 We agree that by sitting on the CUL the editor of the Tiger could rectify this problem . We also agree that he could sit on the board . We further agree that this is not the best way to address the problem .
 We feel, however, that the function of communication does not require a vote; and further, that this vote might prove to be unsatisfactory in the form of bias communication . We feel it might prove unsatisfactory .
 The function of the editor in this instance should be that of an unbiased observer rather than that of a voter . The editor's job is to be unbiased observer of an interested voter, not an interested observer .
 The Tiger editor is not a representative of any such segment, nor is its editor popularly elected . The editor is a member of a political party that is not popular with voters .
 Editor could best fulfill his function as a communicator by sitting without a vote on CUL, and that a vote is in no way necessary for the fulfillment of this function . Sitting as an ex-officio member on various committees is one of the responsibilities of the position .
 We feel further, that this vote would be a greater benefit if exercised by freshmen class commissioners, we feel further .
 You are entitled to your opinions, but some last comments are in order, CNN.com's John Sutter says .
 In answer to point number one, you seem to feel that the TIGER editor exists solely to report what is worth reporting and nothing more . The TIGer editor is happy to answer the question .
 If this were the situation, I would hardly go to such lengths to secure a position on the Committee. If this are the case, I wouldn't have gone to such length to secure such a position .
 It is agreed that a Freshmen Commissioner would be more familiar with freshmen problems than the editor .
 The editor could contribute more to the Freshmen, not that the Editor is more familiar with Freshmen problems . My point was that the editor could help more than the Freshman .
 I don't think you have given them adequate credit for their intelligence. I think they are intelligent people. I'm not giving them enough credit for intelligence, I think . I'm sure they are very intelligent people, and I'm very happy to see that .
 President Benezet requested four more students for CUL, but his point about elected members escapes me . Further, he said that CUL students should be allowed to attend CUL but that's not true .
 Judicial Board of the Associated Women Students is accepting applications for the position of editor of an interdormitory paper .

 "And then we have war games, right here at our peaceful liberal arts oasis," she says . "We're going to war games right here," she adds .
 Colorado College has again demonstrated the value of compulsion in achieving its ends, means, or something, by leaving the required major in leadership in it curriculum . Colorado College is a fortress of learning and knowledge .
 Many a convincing argument has been given for this major in ROT( One is its disciplinary value . Another is the disciplinary value of the major . The major major is a major in the Army National Guard .
 Discipline, as defined by tti ROTC, includes the ability to shine shoes properly, and to do ungues tioningly that which you might not understand or agree with . Discipline is defined as discipline .
 ROTC was compulsory when students came to CC, it was compulsory . Another argument to qualitfy the compulsory nature of militai things is that each and every one of us knew, when we came to come to CC .
 And besides ROTC is a good draft dodgering device. This by itself justifies its being hi . And besides, it's good draft dodging device.
 It also helps avoid work, and as we all know, everyone wants to be a chief, and it's not just one of the tribe . It's also also a way to avoid work .

 You are taking a great liberty in defining the position of the editor of the TIGER editor . Finally, you are taking the liberty to define yourself as an editor .
 My ""pay"" as you so bluntly put it, is somewhat depleted by the hundreds of miles of driving done by the staff, the meals missed and the hellish responsibility of meeting a deadline every week .

 In Opposition in a democracy if we will take the trouble ami responsibility necessary to make it so . JH Colorado College Tiger October 7, I960 .
 I say you helped because your respect for the contribution of each of us makes us respect our own contribution . We can take it from there, and soon everybody is helping and you have achieved your purpose â not personal agreement, but good government . I say .
 We are apt to think of the government as ""they;"" to lose the meaning of the great words like freedom, democracy, civil rights, etc., etc. We forget the simple truths, says the author of the book .
 The only way it can become an unfriendly, outside force is if we neglect our responsibility of making our desires known . We need to make sure that our desires are made public, and that they are not ignored .
 You are vividly aware that the ""we"" is made up of many categories of people whose varying needs must be taken into consideration in solving government problemsâ ALL of them . Not just labor, or management, or profssional men, or farmers, or housewives or oldsters .
 In dealing with these varying needs, you exhibit an awareness that one reason the metal of our democracy rings so true is that it contains such a combination of alloys . The metal of the metal is so strong that democracy rings true, it has such a strong combination of alloying alloys
 I want to thank you for teaching me the importance of working in the political party of my choice . "I am proud to be able to work for my chosen party," she says .
 Working in a party makes it possible to ""vote for the person"" with more knowledge and intelligence . Working for a party gives you the chance to vote for the candidate with more intelligence and knowledge .
 The name means a person. Now, after helping do the work which keeps a party operating, the name means 'a person'
 "I have met and worked with him, and know his family, and his principles and approximately how he will approach his job if elected," says Sen. Ted Cruz . "I know his principles," says Cruz .

 The history of this hemisphere as it exists today, begins circa 2 A.G. with the old woman who lived in a shoe . Oaaaock Spengler, Tornybee. and Oasock .
 She had so many children she didn't know what to do so she moved most of them into a shoebox . Most of the children were so small she had to put them in a shoepox .
 They adjusted well to shoebox living because they were represented on the Snowshoe Board which made it very democratic and everyone always lives well in a democracy . They adjusted very well to living because of the board's representation .
 Most of the children adjusted so well that most of them lived in the shoebox for 3 years . Most of them spent the third and last year at the centre of their education . The children adjusted well enough to live in a shoelace for three years .

 No one lived like that ever, except maybe during the backwards times of the Spartans or Russian communists . You'd laugh and say that no one lived that way ever . No one has ever lived in such a backwards way, except the Spartans and Russian communists.

 Candidates found common ground on only two issues â defense of Berlin and condemnation of religious bigotry . In a bitter battle of acrid political jabberwocky, each man obviously attempted to say a great deal but mean little .

 ASCC must serve to survive . Unless the ASCC as an organization, furthers the goals of each student to succeed in reaching his goals, it is sealing its own fate .
 Students' goals are not as diverse and polyglot as one might imagine, for if one measures the long term, more general goals of each student and disregards some immediate, very transient goals, one will find a great similarity .
 Most of the CC student body, in coming to CC, has declared itself, at least implicitly, as favoring the ideal of the WHOLE MAN . The ideal is the broadly and liberally educated person, the broadly, educated person .
 This broad education does not solely mean an appreciation and education in the various academic disciplines, but very definitely infers an education from A to Z from Asquith to Zen . This includes an appreciation of the academic disciplines .
 A mature person is a person who has realized both his potentialities and his limitations . The idea is that a college, especially one like ours, should turn out a mature person . The college should be able to turn out an 'adult person'
 Each student surely expects some measure of success in at least one of them, and if he is a voluntary member of this liberal arts school, the chances are that he wants quite a bit of success .
 The idea behind our government, as behind all governments, is that the function of government is to do for the people that which they cannot do as well for themselves . The idea of our government is that it is to help the people, as well as themselves .
 The goal of ASCC is helping to fulfill for each of its constituents, the goals he has set, or is setting for himself . ASCC's goal is to help to fulfill the goals of each member of the board .
 It should readily be agreed that without ASCC the individual would experience more difficult attainment of his goals . ASCC is a non-profit organisation that helps individuals achieve their goals .
 ASCC is either not doing its job, or else has lost its justification for existence . If not, ASCC should not be doing their job . ASCC has been criticised for its lack of transparency in recent years .
 ASCC then, if it accepts the above, must consider everything that comes before it in that context . The ASCC must also consider everything else before it comes to an ASCC decision .
 Student goals are defined as whether or not an event or action will directly or indirectly aid the fulfillment of student goals . That is whether the student's goal is to fulfill it, or not it will aid the student goals of the school .
 The various committees of ASCC have been set up to insure that proper attention is paid to special areas, to wit, the social, the intramural, the publications, publications, the curriculum, and committees .
 Other committees of ASCC, constitution, goals and election are striving most particularly to insure that the ASCC develops the necessary efficiency to be effective .
 The finance committee has the responsibility of financially sponsoring and promoting those activities that the students want, or should have, say the students .
 The enthusiasm and communications committee has the most responsible administrative position of all . It must seek to create and promote an atmosphere and climate where each student will want to be a significant and contributing member of the ASCC in its full sense .
 The area in which ASCC has the most indirect power, and the least direct power, is in the area of the ex-officio . The area of ASCC's most direct power is the area where ASCC is located . ASCC also has the least indirect power in the
 The various ex-officio, almost wholly autonomous bodies of ASCC are to a great extent laden with responsibilities that are implicitly given to ASCC in its guardianship of the student college welfare . ASCC is in charge of the students' welfare .
 ASCC serves as a watchdog for student interests in these areas . The power and responsibilities of these groups are best left where it is best left . ASCC should serve as an independent watchdog for students' interests .
 In sum, let it be said that ASCC has the heavy responsibility of the welfare and freedom of all the students in all the corners of campus life . ASCC is responsible for the welfare of the students at all levels .
 ASCC has no more than a watchdog role in those areas where students are able to insure their own welfare . ASCC is a watchdog for students' welfare, not just students .
 The ASCC must take corrective action in those areas where student interests are being abused, or left unfulfilled, says Gary Gappert . The student interest is being abused in some areas, he says .

 "As I see it, one of the major aspects of a college is its cultural contribution; it is in part a justification for our existence" "One of the colleges' major cultural contributions is the cultural contribution to its existence," says Dr. John Sutter .
 We maintain that the presence of a college is good for a community as a whole, as we are, in a sense, in the culture business . We are in a culture business, and we are in the college business .
 It is particularly in its offerings in the public arts that the college carries on its task of bringing culture to the community . Music, the drama, fine art and fine art, the radio station, public lectures, etc. etc.
 Fine Arts Center is the biggest single feature of the college's public arts program . The Fine Arts center is the largest in the university's public art program .
 The Hirschhom collection of modern sculpture is without a doubt the finest of its kind in the world . The community owes the Center a debt of gratitude for the opportunity to see it .
 "While these may be fine pictures (or, given a set of values characterized by a certain absence of taste, they might be so considered," they might not be considered . They are not art, and have no business in the offerings of an institution ostensibly devoted to art, he says
 The problem is that every ""Swan"" precludes the possibility of a ""La Strada"" being shown . Every ""Some Like It Hot"" is a Cocteau or an Eisenstein . Every "Swan" precludes any possibility of being shown; every ""Some

 "This was an enormously successful production on Broadway, and millions have had the opportunity of seeing the movie" "The movie was a hugely successful show on Broadway," the director says .
 Instead of watching cautiously for things which will sell, the theater should produce things which are too risky for Broadway or even Civic Theater production . It should take advantage of this fact, and should produce risky things too risky .
 Jonesco or Sarte or Beckett or Pirandello may never father wide-screen movies or make their producers rich, but they are the sources of the greatest vitality in the modern drama .
 I had been told of the excellence of the dance program long before I came here, so I expected that the talents of students and teachers would result in exciting events . I had hoped that the talent of students, teachers and students would result exciting events.
 I am sure that an enjoyable time will be had by all, but I am equally sure that there are many more exciting offerings which would be just as enthusiastically supported by the community as a whole . I am also sure that a more exciting event would be held in the U.S.
 The radio station seems to be under the impression that it is directly competing with the local stations . The shame of this is that the BBC Third Programs, the Northwestern Reviewing Stand of the Air, the Pacifica Foundation, tapes can be had virtually for postage .
 The college has the facilities, the talent, the heritage and, most important, the obligation to make a positive cultural contribution to Colorado Springs and to its own student body . If I may prolong an already over-long letter, I would like to say simply that the college has .
 If there were enough interest evidenced by the student body and the faculty, something might be done . As nearly as I can determine, this is not being done, but I .believe that if there were . enough interest shown, this might be . done, he says .

 The gentleman who spoke Wednesday mentioned the availability of programs by which we could avoid the mistakes other schools have made should we set up an honor system . We can't see referring to the Deans by their first names .
 NSA seems to forget that the purpose of these programs is twofold, the NSA says . The purpose of the programs is to gather intelligence, not to harm the privacy of individuals .
 First, is of course the program itself, but second is the experience gained by the people who have set it up . First, the program is a program that allows you to learn about how to use the program .

 Mr Nixon has a long record of defeating Democrats, many of whom were considered more firmly entrenched in the hearts and ballots of the people than is Mr Kennedy now . Second, Mr Nixon is a long-time winner in the polls, he says .
 If Nixon carries three of the eight states considered a tossup, he will have enough votes to win the election . Further, should Mr Nixon carry California which at the last report was for Senator Kennedy by a margin of one percent with some people abstaining, he would have enough voters to

 In reading Mr Racey's letter last week I agree with his thesis that the radio station is under the impression that we are competing with any of the local broadcasters in output of drivel or anything else for that matter . But I can't agree that the station's statement that the .

 We do program the BBC tapes and we would enjoy airing more of them along with the the the countless other ""canned"" shows that are available to us . We students must team more than how to run a wireless tape recorder or record player .

 Kintz and Ullman are correct in that they were not informed the letter would not be printed . They were not told they would not have been allowed to print the letter .

 Facts had emerged which were evidently not known by the writers of the letters . Further, facts had emerged that were apparently not known, the writers said .
 The administration has always reserved the right to review two types of cases rather than release them to the Student Conduct Committee . An example of these is the fact that the administration has . always reserved . the right not to release two types off cases .
 One type is concerned with psychoneurotic students . The other is concerned about moral standards . Violators of similar standards have been equally punished when the administration is aware of the transgressions .
 "The decision was my own and I take full and sole responsibility for it. The decision is my own," she said . "I take full responsibility for that decision," she added .
 It has been the past policy of the TIGER to print all letters, regardless of the controversial topic of the letter .
 The Editor has the power of the Editor to change this policy, subject to the approval of the Publications Board which felt that I was right in refusing to publish the letters .
 I will not under any circumstances print letters in bad taste, nor will I permit subjects to be undertaken by this newspaper which I feel have no business in a newspaper or which can be better handled in another fashion . I will also not print any subjects which can't be undertaken in this newspaper
 It is my feeling that the letters submitted for publication were guilty of both of the above errors . It is also a feeling that some of the letters sent to the paper were misconstrued .
 Ullman, Kintz and Gappert would care to submit an article or a series of articles on the larger concept of what denotes a gentleman or a gentlewoman . They are more than welcome to submit .
 Such articles should be welcomed by the administration which in the past has shown a reluctance to accept the reports of the students as to the manner of conduct inherent on campus .
 "Such articles will, however, conform to the standards of good taste as determined by me and the Publications Board," he says .
 The new Editor and Business Manager of the TIGER will be announced in the December 9th issue of this paper .

 At last count we had almost four per cent of the student body working on the paper at one time or another . Almost four of the students at the University of Cambridge worked on a paper at the time .
 If we should include the number of students who work on the NUGGET, the KINNIKTNNIK, or any of the other numerous organizations on the campus, the percentage of the student body which is participating in extracurriculars reaches rather astounding proportions .
 This from a campus where apathy is supposed to be rampant, where complaints and criticisms about student government circulate freely . This is not the case of apathy or apathy, but it's a sign of frustration .
 It is the comment from this column that if the readers think this campus is bad, they should try some others . It is a comment from the comment that if you think it's bad, try some other campuses .
 I had an occasion to talk to several students from other schools during the summer while at Fort Riley . I had a chance to talk with several other students from different schools .

 Participation and interest in extracurricular affairs was so poor the administration was forced to cancel many planned programs . Another student said participation and interest was so low that many programs were canceled . Another said participation was so bad the administration had to cancel programs .
 Several institutions are considering disbanding student government completely . A glance at the editorial columns of the exchange papers from other schools reveals that there are several institutions which are considering disbandsing .
 Students from CC sent to regional conventions have reported on occasion that other schools were amazed at the amount of power wielded by the people on this campus . CC students have reported that other colleges have been amazed by the power of the campus .
 This is merely to point out that conditions may not be as bad as we would sometimes believe . This is simply to say that conditions are not as severe as they may sometimes be .
 There can be improvement, and a great deal of it will come from the students in one form or another . Certainly there can be improved, and the students must improve .
 It behooves this complacent fraternity man to have his say too . However, we have quite a start on other schools, writes JHC .
 This fact has been long lamented by many, but gripers come and gripers go, but the cultural sins stay on forever . This is a fact that many of America's cultural sins are long-lasting .
 Because you very people who creatively and glibly attack our cultural lag, or gap, do not follow through with any action . Because they do, they don't follow through to any action. Because you can't be creative and gliffy, you can be creative .
 The democratic senator from Pennsylvania, Joseph Clark, professes that ""in America sometimes a lot of talk is a prelude to action""; but here at CC it seems that this is not the case of action .
 No, we of fraternity alley have not come here to learn to walk into a room properly, to make floats, to pour tea and smile, etc. We have come to learn how to walk in a room, make floats and smile .

 Fraternities have decided to stay in the fraternities and change their ""evilness"" into ""goodness" rather than to stay outside the Greek system, and watch a potentially good force falter .
 We also feel that in our heterogeneous Greek groups, we have, for our own cosmopolitan benefit, access to a greater range of thought than if we remained content with the security of the fellowship of others just like ourselves .
 Edward Kintz and Donald Ullman accused of 'near-slanderous' accusations . It is wondered whether or not you have evidence with which to back up your accusations . The pair appeared at the bottom of the published letter .
 As a leader of a major publication on this campus, you have shown gross inadequacy in your ability to arrive at a rational conclusion concerning ""a group"" of which you know absolutely nothing," says the editor .

 Students are freely chosen by their own governments and they come to the Congress to debate and vote according to the rules of parliamentary procedure . Students are chosen by the students' own governments .
 I have no sympatl with anyone who complains that the USNSA does not represent the position when they have made no effort to have their opinions heard within the Association . I'm not sympathetic to those who complain that the U.S. does not .
 Democracy is based upon the premise that people who have a t of view will offer it in the open market-place with all the rest of the rest being tested and either accepted or rejected . Democracy is about people offering their views and accepting them .

 This does not mean that problems on your camp are not important and should not be dealt with by student governme . It means that it should deal more with problems that are important the education of students . I submit that solving problems that have already been solved elsewhi does not do that

 He said dues would be in the neighborhood of $100 a year and to send a representative to a national convention would cost around $70 . Yet he stated that dues would not be as high as $100 .
 For $170 we can send one representative to a convention and receive NSA publications . The cost of the convention is $170 .
 I feel that the money could be better spent on the Colorado College campus . The money could instead be spent on Colorado College .
 The students of the t lege have a larger responsibility fulfill on this campus . Finally, the students of this campus should be responsible for their actions .

 Peter replied that it is very difficult to judge fairly two such different types of environment . To the question of how he would compare CC with German Universities, Peter replied .
 The atmosphere is more conducive to studying here than at a large university . There is also a greater personal contact between a student and his professor and likewise among the students themselves .
 In Germany, a student knows his professor through little more than his classroom lectures . Students in Germany can only communicate with their professor through their classroom lectures.
 Peter has been impressed by one of the CC faculty members who even plays a clarinet in a local dance band . Peter says he's impressed by a member of the faculty at the University of Cambridge .
 Favorable in Peter's opinion is the fact that all buildings of the college are close together . Peter says the college is a good location for students and students .
 The main university building often is located in the city while the chemistry, physics and other institutes are frequently on the outskirts of the city .
 Peter observes in our college system that have not grown up with this tradition as the Germans have . One big drawback is that we don't have the same tradition as Germans have, he says . Peter observes that the college system is lacking in its tradition .
 Peter briefly mentioned other points concerning student life in Germany . Peter briefly discussed other points about student life .
 It is entirely up to the individual whether or not he attends classes, he said . He can do most of his studying at home as long as he prepares himself for the final examinations .
 Students in Germany learn to manage on much less money than Americans usually have . Peter says students learn to deal with less money and manage on less .
 Peter brought the interview to a close with his observation that in Germany students are more independent . In Germany students possess more individuality as a result of their freedom .

 Despite Mr Shaw's rather feeble humor, the band's numbers were announced with a minimum of useless chatter . The show was held in New York City, New York .
 The numbers ranged from Basic to Blues, ""Stardust"" to ""Mack the Knife,"" with each selection done masterfully .
 It would be less than useless to say any one member of the group stood above the other . It's not a matter of whether any one of the groups stood above each other .
 The band remained behind a solo performer, never overshadowing him, but never letting him down . 1 think it should be mentioned that Mr Wallace Caldwell is fairly well responsible for the band .

 Wright considers the first three sections of the book excellent, but he feels that the discussion of quanta does not measure up to the other sections . Wright feels that Einstein was not an adherent of this theory, probably because he was not a fan of it .

 The activities of many of these groups are stepping stones in communicating the Colorado College way of life, but are only too often unheard of . Colorado College is proud of the diversity of its students .
 The interest of many groups is appealing to other students and faculty members . The interest is often not publicized until the last minute if publicized at all .
 The mass of this college is composed of these groups such as the athletes, art students and musicians . The art students joined together for a coming exhibition, the musicians for a concert or simply for their love of music .
 Colorado College is a well rounded college with active groups of students . Put all of these active groups together with other groups and you have the well rounded Colorado College .

 I do not feel that this is something that can't be tossed aside as another gripe, for here are bases for a beginning improvement . I don't think that this can be thrown aside as a gripe .
 I would like to hear your comments on the situation, both student and faculty . Maybe we can improve our campus relationships simply by knowing what each other is doing .

 KRCC began as a two room public address system in the basement of Bemis in the old Cogswell Theater . KRCC was the only local radio station at that time, with occasional interviews with KVOR .
 Tyree Tyree was able to build a radio station, bpth in a tangible, physical and in an intangible sense . Tyree's varied experience includes carpentry, college teaching and carpentry .
 CC acquired several GI buildings from Peterson Field, including South Hall, among them South Hall . CC acquired a number of buildings from the field .
 In 1947 KRCC was able to move into a remodeled South Hall and have their own studio . Thomas Rawles, at that time treasurer of the college, arranged to provide the station with some extra money .
 KRCC went on the air in 1951 when the station went on Ctly from its own studios and rely on transmitter, via telephone lines, to the stations downtown . This w the air with its own transmitter .
 Since 1951 KRCC has undergone many minor improvements aided by the time, efforts, and money of many others . KRCC was founded in 1951 .
 The last major innovation for KRCC came just recently with the transfer of the radio studios to the new Rastall Center .
 ASCC provided funds to extend broadcasting lines from Perkins to Rastall . Herbert Schubnrth, chief engineer for KRDO, provided invaluable technical assistance .
 "Everybody benefits from Benezet, and KRCC is no exception," says Tyree Tyree . The KRCC says it is "no exception"
 Now that the station has become full grown, it only needs to consolidate its position . The station is now a full-grown force in the world .
 Tyree suggests that with proper interest and co-operation, new and better programming and increased public knowledge of the KRCC potential could be achieved .
 He mentions the possible development of a fullfledged Communications Center that would be able to use to the fullest audiovisual techniques as devices to further education and culture .
 This Center, like KRCC does now, would attempt to further the cultural life of the college in the present . This Center would also serve as a laboratory for those who wunted to familiarize themselves with these ""cultural techniques"" for use elsewhere .

 Two articles came across our desk recently which we felt were worth passing on . Colorado on the corner of the corner is a weekly feature on CNN iReport .
 A letter from the NSA closed with the comment that Mr Johnston had written the main office in Philadelphia about Colorado College . Colorado College is located at the foot of historic Pike's Peak .
 Letting Pikes Peak fall where it may, there can be little doubt in anyone's mind that the scenery is inspiring . The nearness of the ski slopes may not be an example of the scholastic inspiration .
 In fact, if the poll were as crass as those conducted by the tourist industry, one might even place a dollar value on it . The poll was conducted by CNN.com .
 If the meeting between the administration and the Greek powers-that-be were to be summarized in any way, it might be condensed to the point that the administration is concerned with making Colorado College, a school which has committed itself to being a fraternity school, the best of all possible worlds
 The administration has long made its desires known insofar as deferred rush is concerned . The White House has a long history of deferred rush .
 IFC and Panhel have long done everything possible but approach the problem realistically . Unfortunately, Panhel and IFC have long been doing everything possible to address the problem .
 The fraternities were unable to decide upon a plan workable and acceptable to all concerned . Fraternities have been unable to agree upon a solution to the situation .
 The sororities have claimed that the added financial burden will drive them into bankruptcy and hence off of the campus . The sorority has claimed that they will be forced to leave the campus in bankruptcy .
 The administration claimed that the financially hit houses would be covered by the school for a year during which time the plan would be tested . Of course, when this was mentioned at the meeting last week, the administration said that the school would cover the financial hit houses for the year .
 There has been some comment that if deferred rush is installed, certain houses will suffer . Certain houses are afraid that if the Freshman see them at their daily best, they will be disillusioned and go to another house or worse yet, remain unaffiliated .
 It is true that the installation of deferred rush is receiving its major impetus from the administration . A case can be made against the administration for telling a student body what it will do .
 There has been little concerted effort on their part to present views opposed to those of the administration, or even to define their own values . However, the case against the student government bodies is even stronger .
 President Benezet has seen fit to do some of their work for them in setting forth some principles and proposals . It is hoped that they will be able to agree among themselves to such an extent that they can come up with a deferred rush program for next year .
 IFC will have to work with IFC if anything approaching an effective rush program is to be inaugurated . However, they will need to work closely with the IFC .
 Ski Clothes Exhibition Presented by Panhel ""Schuss in Style,"" will be presented by the Panhellenic Council next Tuesday evening, December 13 .

 Many of the events which could or should be of interest to the campus are unattended due to a lack of publication . This week's column was a response to a question about the lack of coverage of events on campus .
 I should like to point out something which is new, and therefore has perhaps escaped notice . However, I should also point out that this is not the first time I have seen a new thing .

 Any organization invents four years of nonsense to entertain its idle members is not neutral but is as outdateda as the Racoon coat . Any organization which invents . invents such nonsense is not . neutral but as outdatea as . outdated .
 Mr Gappert, the world may be basically a 'fun place' for you and the gang, but it is not going to be for long unless we take an interest in the more serious and even crucial things on our shrinking fuseridden cannonball of a globe .
 Students without fraternities would have more time and more unbiased opportunity to make more serious, productive and meaningful lives for themselves, author says .

 If our cultural events are so few and far between I feel that one hour or so of one's study time per week for attendance will not affect a grade average in the least . If our culture events are few, far between, we need to attend cultural events more often .

 Some people say that the deterrent power of these weapons is so great that there will never be another war . Some people believe that the weapons are so powerful they will never have another war.

 This is not oratory, or an excerpt from the catalog, or propaganda from a fund drive; it is a fact that anyone with four years experience on this campus must acknowledge . Anyone with four-years experience must acknowledge this fact .

 The familiarity of the terms ""hidden persuader"" and ""status seeker"" in our society attests to the renown of Mr Packard . The familiarity . of the . terms ""Hidden persuader" and ""Status seeker"" is a reference to Packard's work . Packard was
 Best known for The Hidden Persuaders, The Status Seekers and The Wastemakers . Has written many articles for newspapers and magazines ranging from national to family problems .
 He is a reporter, in the best sense of the word, for he seeks to inform the public objectively and thoroughly with an aim to improvement .
 At forty-six Mr Packard spends much of his time near Martha's Vineyard, Mass., writing extensively. unusual pieces such as a Psalm setting by Heinrich Schutz .
 Beethoven, Richard Strauss, Brahms, Faure, Duparc, Mozart and Verdi are the other composers to be represented . Mozart, Mozell, Strauss and Brahms are among the composers represented .

 Students must be able to distinguish trivial and important, and know enough about past writing to recognize the new and the notso-new . Such writing implies two prior requirements .
 Kinnikinnik does not show these requirements being met . With some notable exceptions, the writing does not appear to be met . Kinnikinik is the latest in a long line of events in the world .
 Probably the most disappointing feature of the current issue is the many snippets of two to eight lines; although they are fewer than those of the previous issue, the persistence of these frivolities signifies a continued domination .
 Both Alexander Pope and Ogden Nash can show us how difficult they are to do well . I am against neither humor nor epigrams .
 On the second point, that student writers ought to know something of past writing, 1 read only spent twenty years in India as a missionary, the latter six years being spent as Bishop of Tinimevelly .

 Writers, especially of poetry, must be readers; if not, it is something like trying to write a foreign language using only a dictionary and a grammar . Poems must be read by people, especially poets, to be able to write poetry .
 To return to the problem of significant form, I see, particularly in the longer works, a constant wavering between prose and verse . The longer works are more like prose than verse, especially in the works .
 In general, the poems should be more poetic (condensed, allusive, rhythmatic, concrete) and the stories more developed in plot and character . The poems are more poetic and more developed .
 There are no real stories in the issue â they are fables or fragments (call them what you will) which lack plot, character, and social context . Perhaps I should not say ""stories,"" for there are no stories," for there is no real story .
 Colorado College has a reputation for producing bad light verse . Perhaps also the writers feel that their background has not given them enough material for realistic short stories .
 More and longer stories would both balance the magazine and eliminate the verse deadwood . I am sure that a devotion to writing and careful observation can cure both ills .
 The absence of short stories connects with the issue's prevailing lack of concern for the pressing issues of the day . With the exception of the slight ""Progress"" and the trite ""Berlin,"" there is little to show a participation in the growing social and political consciousness of American students

 Each week a different area of study concerning world affairs is taken up by the World Affairs Council . This week's focus is on the role of the Council of State .
 The method of study is to form small groups to meet once a week in someone's home, business, office or shop . Small groups meet in person's homes, businesses or shops .

 Colorado Springs, Colorado, February 17, 1961 Colorado College VANCE PACKARD . Tuesday night in Shove Chapel Mr Vance Packard deed a lecture entitled ""The Changing Character of the merican People"" as part of the Colorado College Public LecSeries .
 Packard said we are undergoing an (tensive change in values, Mr Packard maintained that priarily these changes are the result of the impact of growing immericalization in our society .
 Since the child of mass prois of necessity mass adirtisiug is of necessity . The problem which arises how to persuade the public to insume at a rate proportional to nc leasing production .
 Advertisis promoting self-indulgence, :raving for newness, impulse lying, the desire for products ith strong status overtones, in lort, a ""thing-minded"" culture . Adirtising has left no stone unfiled in seeking out new markets

 Colorado College was exposed to a most beautifully articulate spokesman of Christianity . Bishop Stephen Neill is a bishop in the Anglican Church . The lectures were sponsored by the Religious Affairs and Assemblies Committees .
 The list of activities and accomplishments that appears in any thumbnail sketch of this man only serves as reinforcement to the less objective but more vivid impression with which he left his listeners . The list, however, only serves to reinforce to an objective but vivid impression of the man .
 Bishop Neill, the Irish Anglican, the missionary, the publisher, the author, the speaker, showed a charm and a humility which added interest and effectiveness .
 Bishop Neill lectured both formally and informally on various aspects of his Christian career . He dealt with questions of Christian and Anglican theology, missionary work, and the world church movement .
 Four lectures revealed a man, a bishop, who could talk effectively on Christian metaphysics, as he did Sunday at the Shove Chapel service . The bishop also spoke on the ecumenical movement, and on problems and approaches to missionary work in Africa .
 The unifying factor in the series of lectures was not so much in the subjects dealt with, but rather in the manner of presentation . The uniting factor was the presentation of the lectures .
 "Always without notes, he worked into this organization a few jokes, many specific examples of the points he was making marked by subtlety and precision," he said .

 English Opera The opera ""Dido and Aeneas"" is the only English opera of any great merit in a period when many masterpieces were being written in Italy and France . Blow's "Venus and Adonis" is the first English opera to be written in England .
 Handel's operas were not found in England until nearly 60 years later . Not until nearly sixty years later with the operas of George Frederick Handel can anything else be found in English of comparable stature . Handel was the composer of the 18th century's most famous opera,
 26 voices for the Workshop production are drawn from the college madrigal group . The chorus of 26 voices is drawn from 26 voices in the chorus .
 Dance, for centuries an important aspect of opera, is being choreographed by Mr Norman Comick . Dance is an important part of opera and a vital jart of this production .
 The eight dancers assume at different times three identities as court people, witches and sailors . As does the chorus, the chorus must assume different identities as witches and court people .
 The two piano accompaniment will be provided by Mr Jenkins and Miss Jill Tyler .
 Dido, queen of Carthage, and Aeneas, a Trojan prince, destined to found Rome, full in love . Dido was the daughter of Dido and the son of the Trojan prince .
 Aeneas and Dido are both aware that fate has decreed responsibilities for them other than marrying Dido . The prince is confident he can defy his destiny .
 The sorceress and witches, jealous of anyone who might prove both prosperous and happy, know Aeneas' fate . They conspire to send him toward Rome before he and Dido can be married . The sorceresses and witches are jealous and send him to Rome before they can be
 Aeneas deceives him with a mandate to embark immediately for Italy . A spirit, conjured up by the sorceress is disguised as Mercury and appears to be Mercury . Mercury appears to appear to be a spirit, deceiving him to embark on a mission to Italy .
 Judgement and Love Dido's suicide, and ""unreasonable"" act in twentieth century eyes, was fully understood by the Elizabethan audience of Purcell's War . Motivation for the suicide lies partially in the suicide of Dido .
 A woman's disappointment in love was complicated by her pride as a queen who ruled majestically without mistake . Her disappointment was compounded by her desire to be a queen without mistake.

 'Extra-curricular activities' plays a debatable role in college life . Mapper _ JfflW TORMBY uiMi printed Friday* by PEERLESS PRINTING .
 An education, a superior education, can be obtained by sitting in classrooms for a certain number of hours per week, per year, or per four years . An education can be achieved by a certain amount of hours a week or per year . The education, an education, is a superior
 It seems there is nothing specifically necessary or sacred about the time American students spend outside of class hours . It seems that there are no sacred places to spend time on campus .
 The CC student has had an opportunity to hear and meet two outsttanding members of this last category . CC students have had a chance to meet and meet members of the community .
 Bishop Stephen Ieill is a world leader of the ecumenical movement . Mr Vance Packard is a prolific meta-sociologist . Mr Packard was a prolific and prolific meta sociologist .
 Bishop Neill is a devoted member of the Anglican Church, the only church founded on a readiness to compromise itself out of existence in the event of the formation of a World Church .
 The frank and intelligent attitude of this gentleman inspired a realistic optimism in mankind that is as rare as the personality itself . The frank, intelligent attitude was the real optimism in humanity that is rare as a personality itself.
 Mr Packard, with the astuteness of a studied gadfly, projected an incipient social doom with, what seemed to us, a sad lack of the frank specifics of cause and correction . The other hand, on the other hand .
 We feel that CC is progressing well in maintaining its status as an educationally liberal institution, but as in all things, time is precious in its rarity, especially extra-curricular time .
 We feel it is sad but not surprising that students would be more attracted to a session on a public psychoanalist's couch than to talks on church union, the Christian life and Christianity in Indo-Africa .

 Pacifism Discussed During Coffee Hour on Thursday, February 9 . Two aspects of pacifism discussed in the WES Lounge .
 Mr Grace started off the discussion by commenting on the religious bases for pacifism . Mr Grace said that pacifism is a form of religion .
 He said pacifism grows out of a way of life based upon love . Not a romantice love, but a love which respects the dignity of other human beings, he said .
 Love of this nature is a creative power which helps one to overcome fear and to lead a life eschewing not only the evil of war but all evil . Love can help one overcome fear, says the author of the book .
 Mr Grace pointed out the inextricable relationship between the New Testament message as found in ""The Sermon on the Mount"" and the idealism of pacifism .
 He implied that the pacifist's ideals are no different than those which form an essential core of Christianity . The pacifist said that pacifism is no different from Christianity .
 Mr Gamer spoke about what pacifists are like, and the various reasons which have motivated them to become pacifists . Mr Gamer also spoke about the reasons for pacifists to be pacifists.
 The religious or moral pacifist adheres to the pacifist ethic of non-violence in all human affairs . The pacifist is a pacifist who believes in non-violent action .
 The pragmatic or nuclear pacifist tolerates violence but does not wish to support a war involving nuclear power . Following the discussion several of the audience began a question and answer session .

 I'm sure he has alienated more people than he has otten to rally behind him. I'm not sure how many people have been able to rally around him. He has alienated many more than he should have done .
 Mr Packard spares neither political party for their contributions to this burgeoning attitude of self first, last, and always . Packard: "Self-first, last" is a self-first attitude .
 In an interview on Tuesday he stated that ""We must preserve as much of capitalism as we can,"" that we must ""try to check the slide towards socialism,"" and rid the economy of ""make-believe work" that has been perpetuated by laborgovernment colusion .
 President Kennedy can not be criticized for his economic politics because they keep changing from press conference to press conference . He still feels that President Kennedy talks too much of economic groth without consideration for natural resources or the ability of the economy to absord further increases in production .
 He does definitely feel the need for and the . need for meeting ""unmet challenge for building up the nation's social capital"" and in so doing, absorbing at least ten per cent of the . nation's productive energy .
 Growth and employment could then be substained without glutting the market place with unneeded goods . Growth could be subbed into jobs and growth without over-stimulating the market .
 Mr Packard attributes chronic unemployment and poverty stricken areas, which are incongruities in the midst of the waste and gluttony he sees around us, to the part of people refusing to leave depressed areas .
 Mr Galbraith says there is a general laxity of unemployed people to seek jobs in the face of relatively high unemployment compensation checks . He also feels that there is also a laxity in the UK's unemployment compensation system .
 Mr Packard also portends the ""technological revolution"" and the ""baby booms"" as mixed blessings in lems of the American way of life .

 Authors suggest the creation of a federally administrated institution that will underwrite capitalistic ventures of Mr Man-in-the-street . Author says the new capitalist is more unneeded and im;es open to governand more unemployeeded .
 Mr Packard admits to reading profusely and regards works such as his own as being necessary to awaken latent American sensibility .
 Critics that call his works superficial and misleading because of out of context references he cites are just reacting to the truth of his subject matter and not his style, he says . He feels that critics that say his works are superficial are reacting only to the facts of his work .
 He mentioned a twelve page review in ""Printer's Ink", an advertising trade journal, that criticized the superficial handling of this subject but failed to include any examples of his work in it .
 Mr Packard's next book, to be published in about eighteen months, will deal with executives .
 Watch for ""the Pacesetters"", watch for "still a secret" Whatever the title, it seems likely that he will produce another best seller .
 His approach may not seem ideal to those accustomed to scholarly research, but he does attack pertinent problems and situations that are all too readily ignored by the average American . Although he may not be ideal, he attacks pertinent problems that are often overlooked .

 The success of this past weekend, then, is almost overwhelming in comparison with past attempts of this nature . The success was almost overwhelming compared to past attempts .
 The most interesting factors in this achievement are how and why it came about . It is not the first time the world has seen such a feat in history .
 Almost 75 members of the sophomore class participated actively in supporting their project .
 These people had decided to make something of their Winter Carnival which they began planning last spring . They began planning the Winter Carnival last spring and decided to get involved .
 They worked with enthusiasm and perseverance in committees and individually, many giving far more time than they could actually spare . Many of them gave more time to work than they were able to spare .
 The point of this article, however, is not merely to make a wellearned eulogy . Conclusions: The point is to make it clear that this is not just a eulogary, but to clarify the point .
 Some useful conclusions can be drawn from the results and reasons behind this successful carnival . The carnival has been a success story for many of us .
 A group of students with an idea, getting behind it and working out the details carefully . Here are some of the students working on the details .
 We have enthusiasm and interest being generated thoroughly among the other students of CC by one class . The students' enthusiasm is being generated among other students, says the principal .
 All-campus activities sponsored by an interested group are appealing to students on this campus . Perhaps there is not as much lethargy within us as we would be led to beleive criticism . Perhaps events can be worthwhile, perhaps all-campus events .
 Perhaps of student writing is not only one of learning technique and form, perhaps it's one of attitude . But perhaps it is perhaps one of the most important lessons of writing .
 The suggestion has been presented that the reason our writers relied on dilettantism iu their writing is that they are dilcttants . That our student body is uncxeited, uncoimnftteed mid unconcentrntcd .
 It appears la la the more casual observer that we might . Well he dilating our lives with so many activities thai we have no time For serious loyalty. Well he might .
 To the question of why do our students over-engage their lives, tins writer would hnznrd Clint Clint would say . Clint perhaps we, like our society, prefer tu spread ourselves thinly than live in depth .

 We cannot conceive how more than $40.000 is spent on ail such extra-curricular activities . Beyond finances if the value of ""as much a part"" is interpreted as student participation, this too we doubt .

 The returning student and the freshman are confronted with many yearround activities, from social fraternities to student government which all demand early efforts . Aside from the fall football season, there are many yearlong activities, such as social frathes and student government .
 At any particular time of the year, football becomes an important activity to any but the relatively small number of students involved . Football is an important part of the life of a small group of students, says the FA .
 A college campus inevitably has its students whose enthusiasm is so overwhelming it seems to build up morale and to speak for a large portion of the campus . Students' enthusiasm seems to be so overwhelming that it builds up morale for a campus .
 In a small college like CC, such an attitude would be healthy onlv if it were so wide and so great that questioning it would seem ridiculous . The attitude is healthy in small colleges, but it would be more if the attitude were so great it would make it seem ridiculous to question
 CC's college morale is not obviously built around intercollegiate sports . CC's enthusiasm isn't obviously a by-product of sports, both illustrated again by the small number of participating students .
 This is true in that any part of campus life serves to identify the student, but the degree to which football does this is questionable . Football is a big part of the campus life, but it's not the only part of it .
 CC student government is a large organization, interest clubs incorporate almost every academic field . The social calendar is full, indicating legions of committee chairmen and functions for students to attend .
 Football is not, in relation to other factors, a large tool for the student's identification and association with football . Football is a large part of the reason why football is not a large factor in student identification and associations with football, according to the study .
 Intercolegiate sports has not been fulfilling these four criteria for extra-curricular activities . The important point to be made is that there are other ways which could do a more effective job .
 "The importance of growing closer to the source of truth or of training leaders is not to be slighted," says David Cameron .
 The fact must be faced that it is time to try another approach to the problem, says David Cameron . The fact is that it must take a new approach to solving the problem .
 An enlarged intramural program, the new gym, and more opportunity to participate in individual sports may lend themselves beter than the spectator sports have to the demands of a small college .

 The commissioners wasted another hour wasting another hour on Tuesday morning . Personalities excluded, the commissioners did a fine job of wasting the morning .
 The main point for discussion was the election of a new class officer due to the necessary resignation of Mancel Mitchell . The election was held in response to the resignation of Mitchell .
 The five nominees were the same people who were nominated near the start of the school year . The nominees are the same students who were nominally nominated .
 With all respect to these five people, the fact that there were no new nominations allowed, merits some concern, says CNN.com's Tom Charity .
 I arose and proceeded in nominating a sixth person to the list whom 1 felt was more suited for handling the job . I then nominated a sixth candidate to be nominated for the job, which he said was 'more suited' to handle the job.
 I was told, however, that I could not nominate my candidate because of the limiated amount of time and a restrictive clause in the ASCC constitution . The ASCC has a strict time limit in order to nominate a candidate .
 It states that no nominations be in order during an election for a vacancy of office . No nominations be made during such an election, it states .
 This is not only undemocratic, in the strict sense of the word, but is highly symbolic of apathy and apathy . Much complaining has arisen in the past on the poor attendance at these freshman class meetings .
 An apology is in order to those members of the class whom I may have offended . I have been doing much of the complaining and now feel that an apology is . in order .
 I can see now that the poor attendance is only partly due to the student. I can plainly see now . I can . plainly see . now that . poor attendance was only partly . due to student. attendance, I can now see .
 The larger and inexcusable blame is on the shoulders of the class commissioners . The class commissioners should be held accountable for their actions .

 In this letter, many of the problems faced by the conscientious objector are realized . Many of the issues faced by conscientious objectors are realized, the author says .
 No one has of yet accurately determined or legislated the grounds upon which one may legally become a conscientious objector for reasons other than religious . No laws have been passed so far regarding conscientious objections .
 It is morally wrong for one human being's ethic to be replaced by the ethic of an organization formed solely for the purpose of organized war . It's morally wrong to replace one human's ethic with that of the organization formed for war .
 This authoritarian ethic is unjust for it superimposes the will of a corps of legislators and armed service officials upon the free will of the individual . It is unjust, says the author .
 If objection were to be recognized on humanitarian grounds alone, many ""shams"" could claim exemptence from sertime"" for democratic and parliamentary procedure, then I can blame no one for a lack of interest . If objection was to beÂ recognizedÂ on humanitarian grounds, then

 The ASCC meetings are open to the student body . Class officers are not needed to give a running summary of the facts .
 Until the time comes that my class officers show some independent thinking, original ideas, genuine concern, and above all leadership, I can see no reason at all to attend further mettings. Until the . time comes, there will be no reason to go to further meetings.
 All things possible should be done to make the status that commissioners hold meaningful to them, and worthwhile to the class . Commissioner's status should be made more meaningful to students and teachers .
 With the coming of the All College Conference, the whole problem of student government should be allotted as much discussion time as possible . Students should also be allotted time to discuss their student government .

 Many of the critics of football tend to dwell only on the aspect of fiances . Football is not the only aspect of the game, it is the relationship between players and their families .
 There can't be no defense for juall college football in this regard . It's impossible for any small HeGC to finance the cost of its prothrough gate receipts .
 There are more tilings in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in the philosophy of foundations for the advancement of college statistics . The college is a combination of the two, the author says .
 Man is not all mind; he is a creature of flesh and blood; he has a heart, aud the heart, too, must be schooled . Life itself supplies life itself supplies in those four years crowded with wonder which make up college career .
 There arc intangible realities, there are imponderable values of which your carefullest statistician never in the nature of things can take account . There arc int intangible realities, which are difficult to explain, say experts .
 Two and two make four, and the college student will learn that lesson through whatever complexities the formula may be extended .

 This disease may ' familiar to many of you, but mechanics and the results of may be vague . The results of this disease may not be clear .
 The purpose of this essay is to â auaint prospective parents with disease and the factors in leading a child to be healthy .
 This disease consists of an m ja due to breakdown of the f tal blood and consequently reIts in jaundice . This disease is caused by breakdown of blood and re-birth of the blood .
 Rh-negative and Rh-positive fac^ in the blood play an imporu,t role in the development of [g disease] Rh-Negative and Rh -Negative fac^ play an important role in development of the disease . Rh negative and Rh negative play a role in
 When the foetus, the Id embryo, has inherited Rhfcjtive from the father and the |0 ther is Rh-negative, the chance i a harmful reaction between the |âther and the foetetile is very Sod. When the baby is born,
 An antibody is a protein with the capacity to neutralize or react with the antigen . Antibodies are antibodies that can react with or neutralize an antigen, such as an antibody .
 The antibodies produced by the mother pass through the placenta and enter the blood stream of the feotus . The antibodies from the mother and the baby are antibodies that enter the bloodstream of the baby .
 A reaction occurs between the antibodies and the antigens resulting in Erythroblastosis fetalis which, in turn, results in anemia and eventually jaundice . A reaction is caused by anemia, anemia .
 Because of the breakdown of the foetal blood, the red-blood cells are immature and consequently do not 'cany sufficient oxygen to the cells of the body'
 Rh-negative and Rh-positive foctors are inherited characteristics . This is an heriditary disease because the Rh negative and Rh positive foctors have inherited characteristics. Rh negative foctors can cause Rh negative or Rh negative characteristics .
 Marriage between two Rhnegative persons yields only Rh-negative children . A combination of Rhnegative people would not result in the disease . Rhnegative children would not be born with Rhnegative .
 The International Relations Club of Colorado College is sponsoring a series of discussions during the coming eight weeks through the Great Decisions study program . If marriage occurs between Rh-positive and Rh-negative or between two Rh-positives, two types of child may not be married .

 Only dangerous combination results when the foetus is Rh-positive and the mother is Rhnegative . The only dangerous combination is when the baby is Rhpositive .
 If the foetus is Rh-negative and the mother is . Rh-positive, reaction rarely occurs . If the mother and foetus are Rh-Negative, reaction will rarely occur .
 The first child of a marriage between Rh-positive father and an Rh-negative mother is usually not affected because the mother has not had a chance to develop a sufficient number of antibodies to seriously affect the foetus .
 In successive pregnancies there will have accumulated enough antibodies in her blood stream to affect the foetus . The antibodies can be accumulated in successive pregnancies .
 If the presence of antibodies in the mother's blood stream is detected during pregnancy, the child may be given a complete blood transfusion immediately after birth and may be saved .
 Parents should be aware of their blood factors so that they may be forewarned about the possibility of the disease occuring in their chililies .
 The remaining discussions will be held on succeeding Tuesday nights, in the Rastall Center, room 203, at 4:00, except for two discussions in March .

 Reid gave a short history of athletics at CC dating from 1882 to 1882 when the first Colorado College Athletic Association was formed . Reid gave an account of the history of Colorado College Athletics .
 Subsidization has been in existence in one form or another since 1905 . Dean Reid stated that there has been a great change in athletics over this period .
 There were no decisions made or policies formed at this meeting, but several good points were raised .
 It was felt that everyone was in favor of athletics, and all but 2 or 3 of those in favor intercollegiate athletics . All but two or three of the students voted for intercollegeiate athletics.
 The question of spirit was raised and it was mentioned that an increased intramural program would probably be a poor substitute for intercollegiate athletics . The question was also raised and said that an increase in intramurals was probably not a good substitute .
 It was felt that the intramural program as it stands develops rivalries which, while good natured, would become intense if there were no college team to which to rally .
 The spirit would then be for the individual teams and perhaps detrimental to the spirit of the college as a whole . The spirit is important to the students and the students, says the author .
 Spirit was certainly in evidence Saturday afternoon at the ACC . Those interested enough to come to the ACC certainly wanted to maintain what spirit there is .
 If we are going to have intercollegiate athletics at CC as students wish, it seems almost unavoidable that we run a deficit .
 As Athletic Director Jerry Carle pointed out, all colleges of our size have this problem in order to compete . All colleges of this size have to compete, he said .
 Intercollegiate athletics at CC can become worthwhile and worth the financial loss received . We must then make athletics more meaningful to more students by developing an interest in them .
 How this can't be done remains to be seen, but approaching the problem with this type of a constructive attitude certainly seems to be a step in the right direction .

 This power of thought should be directed at developing a sense of values . This is the power of thinking to develop your own values, says the author .
 This development should be continued through all the four years so that at the time of graduation the student will have amalgamated ideas, sifted these ideas and arrived at a new well grounded aet of valueB which will carry over into his life outside of the college community .
 If a professor has definite opinions on the subject that he is teaching, these opinions should be voiced in the clasBioom with the understanding that they are one person's opinions and need not, be adopted in their entirety by the student .
 "It is up to the student to look at what he is being taught and to formulate an opinion one way or another," says author .
 It is not his position to tell his students what to believe or how to formulate their ideas, he says . It's not his role to tell them what he believes or how they should think .
 There are many students on this campus who are not receptive to new ideas . When surrounded by a group of interested students, it is difficult to realize that there are many of them .
 There are students who are intellectually lost in a maze of courses and courses . Students who are "intellectually lost" in the maze .

 Assemblies Committee's program for the dual assemblies on February 28 and March 7, the rationale for their decision, background material pertinent to the film and the committee's wishes regarding the frame of mind in which those present should view it .
 The film is extremely moving in its manner of presentation and its after-effect was witnessed by the burst of laughter, clapping of hands and periods of intense silence experienced by the audience .
 Excerpts chosen from a tape recording of the court proceedings prepared as a rebuttal to the film by some students of the Bay Area were heard afterwards . The Assemblies Committee chose excerpts from the tape recording from the proceedings .
 A major goal in this type of introduction is that each interested person can reach his own conclusion about the film and its significance . Purpose of this program is to help students understand the significance of the film .
 Several undisputed facts are relevant and will perhaps prove helpful to the viewers trying to draw their own conclusions . It would be ridiculous to attempt to describe the film for those readers who did not see it .
 The students were interested in attending the hearings because they disapproved of the activities in general and it was thought some of their professors might be involved . Some of the students were thought to be involved in the hearings .
 The article in last week's TIGER described very aptly the two general factions of opinion and the basic argument between them . Conclusions: The article described the two sides of opinion very aptly .
 So far, however, no clear path to the ""truth"" of the matter seems evident . So far it has been unclear what the truth is .
 The discussions will be led by well-informed members of the faculty next Tuesday at 11 o'clock . Perhaps this will be resolved through the discussions .
 If there is a real ""truth"" behind this seeming abundance of propaganda mixed with fact. That is, if there is there a real "truth" behind this . That is if there are a real 'truth'"

 Colorado College received the applelation of being in a class of snob schools . Student aid at a 'Snob School' is required at Colorado College .
 CC is often compared with the other schools of its immediate environment . The school is unique in its unique position in the world of education .
 In this analysis the fact that whether or not CC is providing a better education is not the question, rather it is enough to say that CC is going about it in a different way . The most immediately apparent difference is financial .
 This year with almost double the number of students, paying a tuition of $950, the total financial aid received by the students is slightly less than $400,000 . It is one of the largest programs supported by a small college in the United States .
 This large program is administrated by the Committee on Student Aid, composed of administrative officers and faculty members, and is a year-round business .
 Ninety-nine students, forty-seven men and fifty-two women have been granted loans totaling $56,000 for the year . The loans are made from funds allocated by the United States Office of Education .
 Just a little less than half of the names that appeared on the first semester's dean's list are receiving financial aid of some kind . It is interesting to note that just a little . less than . half of those students are getting financial aid, according to the list .
 This year's tuition raise has provoked a large degree of student interest, not only as to where this money is going but whether it is being spent for the right things . Students are concerned about whether the money will be spent on the best things .
 Thjl, s s s article was not by-lined, the credit, or the blame, for fg . g article goes to the Tiger as a whole, and, insofar as the Tig| ' represents the student body, to CC as a . whole .
 In order balance out the picture a little, then, another article, prese ing another point of view needs to be written . Another article is needed to balance the picture of the situation .
 ROTC students could be influential force in loosening requirements of Conscientious Objector status to include those who seek such a status on purely ""humanitarian"" or philosophical grounds .
 The bald and brief statements used as background material to support the idea of student interest in loosening the requirements for ""CO"" status made the article both objectionable and worth replying to . But the bald and . brief statements . used as . background material for the article made the . article
 The particular brand of pacifism represented in this article rested on the assumption that to give support to the U.S. military machine is to support war . To support the American military machine, give support for war, the pacifist said .
 The potential for war of such an ""organization"" is tremendous, and the results of such a war would be disastrous, but to say that the armed services exist solely for the purpose of conducting war is absurd, he says .
 The validity, the ""raison d'etre"" of the armed forces today lies not in its military strength per se, but in its potential value . The validity of the military is not in military strength, but potential value, says the author of the book .
 The armed forces, as potential military power, serve as witness to our willingness to support, with force if necessary, our beliefs . Armed forces are witness to the willingness to back our beliefs, writes David Cameron .
 "Without this power, our political maneuvers against Communism would be utterly ineffective," says President Obama .
 Our words need the support of the threat of our actions in order to mean anything . Our words must be supported by our actions, our actions must mean anything, says the author .
 "This threat, this constant military potential, is the chief purpose of the armed services," says President Obama . This threat is the constant potential of the military, he says .
 War will become most likely when the credibility of our threat to war weakens, says George W. Bush . War likely when credibility of the U.S. threat to the world weakens says Bush .
 On the scale of all-out war, the knowledge of our unwillingness or unpreparedness to retaliate under nuclear attack could encourage enemy attack .
 Russia could be in a position to effectively destroy a large percentage of the U.S. military bases . Russia could quite conceivably consider herself to be able to destroy some of the United States' bases .
 If she considered the U.S. to be either unwilling or unable to retaliate, she might find such a means of overtaking her most potent enemy quite the best possible alternative .
 Our military defense depends to a large extent on the credibility of our avowal to retaliate an all-out attack . The country's credibility of its defence depends on its credibility, he said . He added: "Our military defense is very important"
 "The chief source of strength our armed forces is individu committment to the suppoi American ideals," says President Obama . The nation's armed forces need to be committed to American ideals, he says .
 The second assumption made last week's article was that tl ""sanctity of human life 1 highest of all values" The assumption was made was that the sanctity of life was the highest value of life .
 From th point of view, perhaps no better alternative than to avo war at all costs through seeki to have the U.S. government g up all armed forces . From th view of the world, perhaps there are no better alternatives .
 A morifc able position, at least from American point of view, would be that human life b< valuable through certain otfa values such as respect for the dividual, tolerance for diffei points of view and human f dom .
 It is on these value assu tions that our military defena set up, and it's on these i; assumptions that we should commit ourselves to li support of our military system . The U.S. should commit itself to supporting our military, says President Obama .

 With an almost full house and with more anticipation and excitment, the second and final night began . The second and third night of the show began .
 In the excitement they forgot their conductor, N Mr Donald Jenkins, and by the end of the second scene had increased the tempo and gotten a half tone sharp . By the end the tempo had increased dramatically .
 Intermission which followed was just enough for the chorus to collect itself and finish the performance in excellent style .
 Aeneas, sung by Mr Harry Booth, had but one aria which was done â with grace and excellence . Mr Booth, who spent most of his time following Dido on and off stage, sang the aria with grace .
 The greatest achievement in the production of ""Dido and Aenaes"" was the amalgamation of the drama, dance, and music departments . Perhaps the greatest achievement was theÂ amalgamationÂ of the drama and dance departments .
 No one department overbalanced anotherâ the three worked harmoniously to produce an overall feeling of unity . The team was united by a strong sense of unity, not overbalanced one department .

 The last few years have seen the recurrence of venereal disease in this country . Jane Carolyn Hult: Venereal Disease has recurrence in recent years .
 For years the disease seemed to be on the decline due to the presence of penicillin and other wonder drugs . For years, the disease appeared to be going on decline .
 It now appears that the population is developing a resistance to drugs in combatting the infection. cause it works on the internal organs .
 If it can be detected in the first stages, the cure is relatively easy but the advanced stages are much more difficult to cure . The advanced stages of the disease are difficult to treat .
 Gonorrhea is equally as serious, causing arthritis, heart disease, liver and kidney problems, as well as arthritis and liver problems . It can also cause heart, liver, kidney problems and arthritis .
 Many people become sterile by this disease, many more than by syphilis . People become sterile more often by this type of disease .
 Evidence of this disease appears from one to several days after contact, according to experts .
 It moves internally in women and is difficult to detect until the woman is sterile . It is then difficult to find out if a woman has a baby . It can only be detected if she is sterile or not pregnant .
 Four-fifths of all women who have the disease are not aware of its existence . The disease is not uncommon in the United States, but is common in Europe .
 The frightening thing about these diseases is that they are not properly reported and treated properly . The scary thing is that these diseases are not being properly reported .
 Victims' contacts are not known, therefore preventing complete control of infection . In many cases the victims' contacts do not know, preventing control of the infection .
 The two most familiar venereal diseases are syphilis and gonorrhea, both of which are caused by bacteria which are transmitted directly from person to person . The only way to prevent wide spread venereals disease is to find CAUSES AND EFFECTS .

 The editorials, among innumerable other things in the TIGER, have been especially good since you have taken over the paper . "The editorials and editorials are especially good," says editor John Sutter .
 They are clear, strong, and welldeveloped, and make a point without the use of cheap catchphrases and well-worn ideas . They make their point, most often controversial point, without using cheap catchphrase or well-known ideas .

 Last week you produced an editorial which excelled only in being flashy and common . Apparently you decided the latter was the cause, because last week you decided to be flashy .
 The response is not to the point you made (I'm not quite sure what the point was), but to your approach . It's not to say what it was, but to say it's to say that it's not what you made .
 The quality paper you are beginning to produce is worthy of your previous quality editorials . The quality of the paper you produce will be worthy of having your previous editorials published .
 You have shown that responsible points can be made in an intelligent well-presented manner . You've shown responsible points have been made in a responsible manner .
 I hope that lack of response has not permanently deviated you from this approach . I hope it hasn't deviated from that approach. I hope you will continue to respond to the situation .
 Ruth Snodgrass writes to editors of the TIGER . Myles Hopper's letter was published in the February 24 issue of the magazine .
 His criticism of the manner in which the election of the replacement of the freshman class commissioner was run was directed towards freshman class commissioners .
 We would like to say first that the freshman commissioners were in no way connected or responsible for the election . We would also say that the commissioners were not directly involved in the election themselves .
 All elections concerning ASCC are conducted by the ASCC Election Committee . ASCC chairman is fully responsible for the elections .
 Second, he was criticizing the fact that he could not nominate a candidate from the floor because of a restrictive clause in the ASCC constitution which states that no nominations are in order during an election for a vacancy of an office .
 There is all of the contacts and to cure them so that they will not be able to continue spreading the disease . We have no idea where he got this information, but there is all the contacts .
 When it appeared as though doctors had VD under control, many of the health measures were discontinued such as the health clinics devoted entirely to the cure of VD and its detection . The health clinics are now dedicated to curing the disease .
 It is now centered in the age group of 14 to twenty-24 . Most commonly in teenagers 17 and 18 years old .
 It has been predicted that there are more cases among people under twenty then ever before in history . More people under 20 are thought to be at risk than ever before before .
 Thousands of cases are never reported, health department says . Health officials say only the reported cases are only the cases reported .
 Due to the presence of VD clinics in Colorado, the rate in this state has decreased in the last ten years . VD rates have also decreased in Colorado .
 Ann Armstrong: There are 21 states that have shut down all VD clinics . However, there were 21 states where VD was illegal .
 There is an increasing break between "theory and practice" concerning moral standards we apply to sex in the U.S. today .
 ASCC has no such clause in the ASCC constitution in the constitution . This break is evidenced by the fact that ASCC does not have such a clause in its constitution . The ASCC is not the only club in the world to have a constitution .
 If election committee had asked for new nominations it would have been necessary to have had petitions followed by a period of campaigning and posters .
 A special class meeting would have been necessary for campaign speeches and elections . Also a special meeting would be necessary for campaigning speeches and election .
 We are not sayir.g that the election was held in the only possible manner. We are happy to clarify that we are not saying that we did not think that the elections were held in such a manner .
 Next year's elections are to be held in less than two months . The election committee felt that it was the most practical since next year's election is set to take place in just over two months.
 If Mr Hopper was so opposed to the way the election was held, he should have come to the election committee or freshman commissioners before the time of the election .
 He as well as the rest of the freshman class, received letters from the class commissioners explaining the procedure that would be followed in the election .
 They need the backing of the whole class and welcome constructive criticism and suggestions . They need to back them up and welcome criticism from the public .
 Criticism of the type that was in the TIGER, however, suggests motives other than being constructive or helpful . Criticism suggests motives for criticism are not constructive, but helpful .
 Now that we've both stated our thoughts in the TIGER, let's work together. Let's work with each other, we need to work together .
 CC students are more interested in our ability to act than in our writing ability . CC students say they want to be able to act more than write . Students say they are interested in their ability to write more than in writing .
 Head Coach Carle's defense of intercollegiate football at CC was excellent indeed, yet one question nags nags . Jerry Osborne Chairman of Election Committee Susan Heidel Vice President of Freshman Class .
 Intramural sports such as golf, golf, bowling, tennis, handball, swimming, etc. would involve a greater portion of the student community . Unlike football, they are sports wherein the student can involve and consequently given rise to syphilis and gonorrhea .
 The health department has become alarmed at this rise and feels that certain things must be done to cut down on the disease . Conclusions: Health department is alarmed at the rise of the disease and wants to do more .
 More treatment stations must be established; young people should be educated to the dangers . More widespread blood testing should be required for more widespread blood tests . Young people should also be educated about the dangers of blood poisoning .
 "The struggle against VD will be a never ending one because of human weakness," says Dr. David Cameron . The struggle against the disease will be never ending, he says .
 If all cases were reported and all victims reached by medical assistance, the problem of VD would once again decline and many lives would be saved . The problem of sex abuse in the U.S. would also decline, says author .

 Love and Death in the Amerii Novel"" by Leslie Fiedler is lically a Freudian interpretation if the distinctive manner in which f e and death are handled in nerican fiction . Love and death in the American novel is a Freud-inspired interpretation .
 American fiction has shown an unusual fascination ith the horrible and terrifying, says Fiedler . American fiction is incapable of dealing with the normal sexuality, he says .
 American fiction escaped from iexual maturity and responsibility fleeing to pre-adoleseent nature horror stories . American fiction before the twentieth century has escaped from usxxual maturity, says author .

 Students say assemblies slanted the viewpoint presented to the students . However, the most predominating student comment about the series was that the views presented to students .
 Students, Communists and Committee debated post facto . The issue involves three main groups which were present at the time, the students, the Cornwork .
 All three are attacked on many grounds, depending on the ideology of the critic, and with varying degrees of objectivity . All three have been attacked on various grounds, including the ideology and objectivity of the critics .
 The students have been evaluated for their actions in many different ways . The students were evaluated in a variety of ways for their behavior .
 Some say the picketing and demonstrating, although perhaps uncouth, is basically a sign that the students of the country are alert and aware of what is going on outside the academic ivory tower .
 Some students do not grant the students a legitimate motivation, and feel that they were just out for a good time and to make trouble . Some students feel that the students were out for fun .
 The Communists are charged with organizing and leading the students, bu; the degree of their participation is not easily established . The Communists have been charged with leading students .
 It may be said with some certainty that Communist agitators were present and mixing with the students, particularly inside the building where the upset was the greatest . It may also be said that Communists were present .
 Much of the orderly student action was instigated by the student leaders of the Civil Liberties Union . However, it may also be stated that the picket line and much of the . orderly . student action .
 The Committee is questioned, as it often has been, for the manner, it inquires into the lives of the American citizens . The committee is questioned for its manner of questioning .
 It is thought to have unjustly persecuted private lives more than it has investigated the extent of Communist infiltration or has proposed remedial legislation . The government has not investigated Communist infiltration of the country .

 It holds regular programs which generally feature speakers of some note who can speak authoritatively on one or more of the innumerable aspects of international affairs .
 The Y u n g Republicans and Young Democrats are branch organizations of the Citizenship Club . The Citizenship Club is endowed by the Rockv Mountain Citizenship Clearing House .
 The partisan clubs are autonomous in their own activities and arc related to statewide federations of similar clubs . Both the partisan clubs were formed in 1964 .
 The International Relations Club programs are consistently informative on vital issues . Many of these programs are of assembly caliber, but only a few per cent of CC students attend them .
 The Young Democrats and Young Republicans have somewhat smaller memberships than the Interational Relations Club . They are faced with a great deal of apathy and not a little aloofness .
 Students who were actively interested in the I960 campaign have put politics aside for another four years . Students who have been actively involved in the campaign have, for the most part, put their politics aside .
 Many in the college community, moreover, consider themselves above the cliches and practicalities oi partisan politics .
 The basis for these four interest clubs extends far beyond departmental lines . Obviously, the basis for the clubs extends beyond department lines .
 Students have the potential to provide valuable information and experience to nil students, says the author .

 Colorado College Symposiums will be held at the Broadn at the Colorado College campus . A number of noted professional radio personnel and students of college radio departments will be visiting CC that weekend for the conference .
 The topic chosen for the first symposium was the Science-Humanism Controversy . The topic of the symposium will be the science-humanism controversy .
 The TIGER has wondered just how much of a controversy this topic is on the CC campus, and whether the Symposium has awakened additional curiosity and interest in the students and faculty . CC students, faculty and faculty will discuss the topic at a Symposium .
 Both faculty members and students were interviewed and many opinions given . Both faculty and students are interviewed .
 One girl pointed to the origin of the gap between science and the humanities as being in high schools . One girl said science and humanities are often taught in high school .
 There the sciences are predominant with little or no study of ethics and only a practical side of English . There are no ethics in English .
 She continued about the nature of the conflict saying a balance is necessary . An adjustment of the inner life with an ethical standing is not being made to the technological advances of science, she said .
 A science major said that the emphasis should be equal, with special importance given to foreign languages for communication . The emphasis should also be equal with special emphasis given to the foreign languages .
 In college this equal emphasis is maintained with the choice of specialization left to the student . In college, this means an equal emphasis must be maintained in college .
 The trend may be towards specialization, but only a broad knowledge of many things makes this complete . The trend of specialization is not to be followed by a complete knowledge of all things .
 The emphasis should be upon science with a correlation of the humanities, says author . Science should be based on science with the correlation of humanities, he says .
 In the modem world, a universal, Da Vinci-like man is no longer possible, making the communication of these opposing disciplines more necessary . In the modern world, this is making communication between the two disciplines more important .
 Now theorists, technologists and social scientists share the field of scientific inquiry . Now theorists and technologists are sharing the field .
 In high schools the sciences are more teachable because of their objectivity and the younger students' awakened need of certitude with an unquestionable fnundation . In high school the sciences . are more taughtable .
 In later schooling, philosophy and English and art are necessary to an education . However, in later schooling it is necessary to learn about art and philosophy .
 Another professor questioned the necessity of possibility of communication . Another professor even questioned the need to communicate .
 Perhaps the two cultures are of men of two alien temperaments between which there is little possibility of contact . Perhaps there are two cultures of men with little chance of contact between them .
 The problem of two cultures on the CC campus is for the main part an important one . Judging by these interviews, these interviews and then the enthusiastic turnouts for the programs, the problem is important .
 Opinions have varied from the ones stated here of the necessity for some kind of a balance between them . They doubt the controversy is important in the United States or even as another said, exists at all .
 Those who have thought about it or did attend the speeches and discussions feel that the symposium was both stimulating and worthwhile .

 Last week the TIGER presented a format of three articles on sex . Last week on this page was a format for three articles about sex .
 This was done with somequalms on the part of the editors, not because we felt that there might be retribution, but rather because there might not be any response whatsoever . This is not the first time this has happened, but the last time we have seen this story .
 We did get response; granted most of it was vocal but a few did realize that a paper exists not on words spoken but on words printed . We did not get response to the comments .
 In going through the various letters, the following points seemed to predominate, so it is to these points we shall answer . The following points were the following: The point of the question: What do you think?
 The first and most important item was that our TIGER has not been representing the students, that is, providing full news coverage . The first thing is that the students have been represented is that they have not been represented .
 Second, that last week's paper showed up this lack in the most blatant manner in devoting most of page two to three articles on sex, to the privation of other newsworthy items .
 We would like to answer these three points by taking the last one first . We would rather focus on the first question: 'What do you think? Take it first'
 We feel that the TIGER has the potential to be the one campus institution which could provide full communication . We feel it has the ability to be one of the one institutions which could . provide . full communication, we said .
 By ""full communication"" we don't mean just reporting and pictures; we mean much more . By "full communication" we mean full communication, not just reporting .
 We feel that any student should be able to find himself and the issues in which he is interested within the TIGER each week . For example, any student can find himself in the magazine each week to discuss his interests .
 The TIGER should be a mirror of the whole individual, not just in "Greek News,"" or "Slocum Intra murals,"" not in anything specific but rather the whole . Not just in ""Greek News" or ""Three Little Words,""" or
 We firmly believe that each of these articles was legitimate, otherwise we would not have printed them all . We are happy to clarify that each article was legitimate .
 There were three articles, all in one week, all on one page . Rather it was the fact that there was three articles . All three articles were published in the same week .
 Last week's TIGER would seem to be overwhelmingly devoted to this specific subject . Second, that last week's cover story was about this topic .
 If the TIGER is to fulfill this potential of ""full communication"" and thus represent the student body, this must be done from the bottom up, that is from the students to the paper . As we said above above, we said, the Tiger must not be a fabric
 With a very few notable exceptions, the burden of the TIGER is carried by a staff of a dozen dependables . If this is not a faction in anyone's sense of the word, we don't know what is. We don't see what is .
 We do not think of the TIGER calendar as a run-of-the-mill, entertaining calendar . We think tliis is not in any way representative of the Colorado College Student .
 If the TIGER has been unbalanced, the responsibility is ours; but the cure is up to you . It's up to the people to decide if they want to change their attitude .
 The next all-star] meeting is today from about five o'clock till supper; the TIGEB challenges CC students to put their pens where their mouths are . CC students will be challenged to be on top .
 Plei U-rrial iibmi be contacted for further irma . All ma erial will be eration with the abo ve will cation in each issue .
 One of the objects of a liberal education, it is said, is to prepare the student for a more mature later life .
 It would seem that constant warning to college students is hardly a compliment to their intelligence, to say nothing of the quality of the average student at Colorado College . Colorado College has a reputation for its quality of students .
 This attitude is at between boy and girl seems to be realistic and the Cornell adchildish or immature . This attitude seems not to be i east realistic and it's realistic .
 Students can express any form of love during their stay at college . However, let us examine the opportunity afforded the average student on the campus to express love during his or her stay .
 If no car is owned by one of the couple in question, there are a variety of romantic places . There are a number of romantic locations for the couple .
 The park behind the Fine Arts Center offers all the advantages of outdoor loving . It is rather cold in the winter, and the raosquitos and dog walkers create some hazards .
 If one's tastes run to more domestic accomodations, the observatory or Shove Chapel afford cozy nooks if one is willing to wait for the facilities .
 Any comfortable place is immediately turned into an obstacle course when its whereabouts become known . "Any comfortable place can be turned into a maze of obstacles when it's found out"
 In an effort to find the general attitude of the students, the TIGER took a random sampling . Some of the results follow from the results .
 If these three quotes are representative at all of the majority of students at CC it would seem mandatory that some changes be investigated .
 Although student life shouldn't be cloistered we shouldn't have to escape to the back seat of a car to leave a blaring TV set or just to be alone with another . Students shouldn't escape to escape from a car or leave a TV set .
 Our honor system is based upon intellectual responsibility demanded by its occasion; perhaps the same might be sought socially . Hear Editors, I have been withholding judgement on the unique, to say the least, style of your newspaper .
 Articles such as Venereal Disease and Report from Poverty Gulch have no place in a college newspaper to my way of thinking, or at least not as much of a place as you gave them .
 A second disagreement is with the allotment of space to different articles . A third disagreement is over the amount of space in each article .
 "Dido & Aeneas" completely overshadows such an event as the Winter Carnival . "I feel that it is a sad day when ""Dido and aeneas"" completely over-shadows" Winter Carnival. "Aeneas:" is a classic form of
 It would be hypocritical to say that ""Dido & Aeneas"" should be left out, but the Winter Carnival was an occurrence much closer to the students, and the TIGER is a student newspaper .
 The victory of the Trinidad debate team is another article given an undue amount of space, as the Winter Conceit article, I believe . The victory was given an unfair amount of time to give to the debate team, as a result .
 It appears that you are sacrificing the space for articles of a more general interest in order to leave space for subjects that you're interested in . The space is left out for articles that are of a general interest .
 Remember that there are many different people with many different interests among your readers . Remember that many people are different people from all backgrounds .
 We are paying a very capable photographer to supply you with pictures, and I am sure that it is not his fault that they do not appear . We are also paying him to provide us with pictures of his work .
 I find myself in serious disagreement with you again on the subject of sports coverage . "I find myself ... in serious disagreeing ... again," he writes .
 The city newspapers give our athletic teams a hard enough time as it is, and I see no reason for the mouthpiece of our student body to carry on the practice . The city newspaper is a mouthpiece for the student body .
 If your readers really wanted to work a puzzle that badly I'm sure they would go and buy one . If you wanted to do it, you could buy a puzzle for your readers .
 It becomes a chore to have to search for the second, third, and fourth sections of every article . It is a struggle to find the right sections of each article in every article.
 Mr Cashman and I never got along greatly when it came to the TIGER, but now I must congratulate him on his past job and entreat him to give you two some lessons in newspaper publication .
 You may wonder where I can muster the gall to write such a letter as this. I'm not ashamed of my actions, but I'm proud of my work .
 These ideas are not only my own, but those of many people who have discussed this subject with me . These ideas were not only his own, they are those of others who have also discussed it with him .
 "Every student is paying for this paper and they are not getting their money's worth right now," says President Obama . "They are paying their money and they're not getting it right now"

 "I like the higher standards of style and subject that yon have been attaining," says author . I like the 'higher standards' of style, he says .
 Steve Kushnir writes to the editors of this article . He praises the frank presentation of anamolies that exist within the American social milieu . Kushnir looks forward to the same candor, vigor, and responsibility in your treatment of other important issues .
 "Under your direction the TIGER is fast becoming a serious and carefully developed organ of campus expression," says the editor .
 "I have been pleased with the trend being set and sincerely hope you will keep up the good work. Personally, I have . personally hope to keep up with the . good work," says the author .
 There may be a need for a word of caution in view of the editorial page in your March 10 issue . The editorial page of this week's issue will feature a piece of caution .
 It seems to me that as editors of a campus paper, you have a peculiar responsibility to make the paper reflect topics of immediate concern to the campus community . Editor: "It seems to be that as Editors of a . campus paper you have to make . the paper reflects topics of concern

 Logically, sex is a topic of interest among young adults of college age . It is one that quite properly ought to be discussed rationally and intelligently by the students, says author .
 The editorial was a legitimate one, and the same holds true for the article on campus morality . For this reason, the subject of your editorial last Friday was legitimate one . The article was about campus morality, and it was legitimate .
 The third article on VD is quite pertinent to the audience to whom it was addressed . One wonders, however, if the third article is quite so pertinent to that audience .
 I have the very uneasy feeling that the impact of all three on the same page was a bit overdoneâ that it might well fail in the purpose of arousing interest in an important subject' on a rational level but could rather appear too dramatic .
 There is nothing seriously objectionable in any of the three articles taken separately . I would question the necessity of taking up so much space on one page of one issue .
 Perhaps you are going just a bit too fast in your laudable efforts to make the TIGER a prompter of campus discussion on live issues . Perhaps you're going too fast .
 A pinch of caution mixed with a dash of refllection might possibly lead to some second thoughts on the means of gaining your ends . The game will be played in a bid to win the title for the first time .
 I wonder if there are not some students who have sufficient interest in the TIGER and the kind of paper they want to express some opinions in the columns of that paper . I wonder . There are not enough students to express their opinions in columns of the paper .
 Several of the recent editorials have covered topics of some hot interest not too many weeks ago . It certainly seems to me that several of these editorials covered hot topics of hot interest in recent weeks .
 I feel sure many ""Letters to the Editor"" would be welcome to those responsible for the TIGER and others interested in things that concern Colorado College . Colorado College is a college of higher education .
 I feel that it is time that the students express themselves concerning the TIGER, and I know that I am speaking for a great deal of the student body . I feel . that it was time for the students to express themselves about the Tiger, and that I know I am
 I believe that this phrase is no longer valid, for recent issues of the TIGER no longer represent the CC students . I believe this phrase no longer represents the students at the University of Columbia .
 In fact, while reading the TIGER, one can't help but get the feeling that he is being talked down to, that his own newspaper is mocking him .
 The TIGER is a newspaper (with a heavy accent on news); we already have an excellent literary and cultural publication for expounding one's talent in such fields . We already have a great cultural publication .
 The weekly standard columns, although admittedly often run-of-the-mill, were read and enjoyed by students . The weekly column was often written by students, but it was often read by students and enjoyed .
 The Wolfenden Report divided into four major sectio introductory, homosexual offei prostitution and recommendation . Also in Cnbiim is the book ""Live and Let Live" which provides an enlightening, ening comment on the above men tinned report .

 It would be far more re- sponsible to try to bring about I change in the laws than try to re-sponsor .
 True sex is of utmost interest t every CC student and there is n reason it cannot be maturely discussed, but it is not the purpose ol the TIGER to provide education along these lines . If so, wha appears to be near-sensation alism is a poor
 The purpose of the TIGER is to print news and to be an expression of all the students . Colorado College has been called an apathetic campus all too often . I hope that many parents who read that editorial page didn't think it was an expression .

 Two important purposes of college or of a liberal arts education are clarity of thinking and articulate expression . Tejon MEIrose 2-0164 Cap & Gown by Betty Burgoon .
 These are obvious and are simply means, instruments in attaining higher goals, they often obscured . Since these are obvious, they are often obscured, they can be used to achieve higher goals . This is especially true in the United States .
 I am often stricken with how effectiveness and impact of communication are not always a function of the quality of ideas, but of the speaker's fluency . I'm often struck with how effective communication is often a result of fluency, not quality of the ideas .
 It becomes frightening to realize that even if one has a great wealth of knowledge he can still be ineffectual without the ability to articulate his ideas . It becomes somewhat frightening to . realize that . even if . one had a great . wealth of . knowledge, he said .
 Many people are unable to express their ideas clearly and precisely . This is extreme, of course, but no one is so poor of expression that he is completely incapable of communicating himself to others, he says .
 It could be said that this can often be attributed to foggy thinking, and that of logical and orderly thinking . This can be said to be the second point of logical thinking .
 Logical and orderly thinking is a skill that necessarily develops with practice . Logical thinking is one of the most important skills in the world .
 There are many academic practices which aid in developing academic skills, but I would like to confine myself to two specifically, writing papers and participating in discussions .

 The film ""Communism on the Map" will be shown in Shove Chapel . The film is a documentary on the progress of world communism .
 Anyone interested in the film ""Operation Abolition"" will find much of similar controversial interest in this new film . The film is based on the controversial film, Operation Abolition, which was released in 2003 .
 Time permitting, discussion will follow. ideas and to communicate themselves to others. ideas .
 Students generally have to read somewhat hurriedly through many assignments and hence formulate vaguely the essence of the material and their evaluation of such . Students must also formulate their assessment of such assignments and evaluate them .
 When a more critical analysis becomes necessary, as in paper writing, the student organizes the material in a systematic and orderly fashion . The student begins to sharpen his critical abilities when analyzing material .
 For this reason, I feel papers are an excellent exercise, perhaps much more so than tests because of the time element involved . For example, papers are perhaps more so important than tests as they are time-consuming and therefore difficult to read .
 Tests can precipitate muddled expression when in an attempt to get all ideas down and all of the questions answered, the student scribbles the answers with little opportunity to consider the various possibilities of presentation and expression .
 Oral expression can be improved not only through classroom discussion, but through extracurricular discussion groups . Oral expression should be improved through discussion groups, many of which are organized on campus recently .
 The problem of communication becomes more acute when one has to express himself to people outside his discipline . In these discussion groups various disciplines are usually represented . Topics of discussion require integration and synthesis of ideas from several areas of study .
 The student can develop clarity of thinking and articulate expression through many means, but I have offered these two for particular consideration . The students are encouraged to use these two methods to develop clarity .
 Too often the value of writing papers is overlooked, says author . Too often, too often, discussions are underestimated, he says .
 If college students are to be influential members of society, they must be concerned with the development of these skills . College students must consider the various means of doing such .

 At the discussion concerning athletics at Star Ranch, we felt that the dissenting opinion was not adequately expressed . Charles E Puckett writes to the editors of the Star Ranch Review .
 In this letter, we would like to suggest some ideas and solutions to the athletic problem . In this article, we highlight some of the ideas we have received from the public .
 It was pointed out at the conference that spirit and winning teams are directly related . It was also pointed out that spirit is directly related to winning teams .
 What was not pointed out was the fact that winning teams take a great deal of money . Winning teams win a lot of money, but that's not always the case .
 "We question the validity of losing $50,000 alone, much less the cost of the entire athletic program," says the school . "The cost of losing the entire program is unknown," the school says .
 We condemn the solutions to this problem which we offered at the All College Conference . We condemn them as the solutions we offered to this issue .
 The only value we can see in this suggestion is the decrease in attendance taking . We can only see the value of this suggestion if attendance drops .
 Written applications are to be turned in to Mr Al Johnson's office, room 102, Palmer Hall .
 Deadline for application is March 17 . All applicants will be interviewed by the Foreign Student Committee . A mid-April decision will be made .
 It was almost pointed out at the conference that spirit was more important than academics . The conference was held in New York City, New York, last week .
 It is important to realize that spirit is the sum total of many things of which football is just one . Spirit is a part of the spirit of life, not just football, but spirit is a whole thing .
 Spirit may also be achieved through plays, concerts, intramurals, and other such activities which cost far less than the intercollegiate program . Spirit can be achieved by playing, concerts and other activities .
 We feel that the $50,000 could be used in a more beneficial way by broadening of the intramural program and by creating a physical education program which would benefit the entire campus .
 It is our contention that if this happens it will only be due to a failure on the part of the stu.lent body to adjust to a new environment and to create new ideas .
 The choir will leave on the morning of March 29th, return the afternoon of April 10th, and will sing eleven concerts during that time . They will sing 11 concerts during the time .

 McReynolds displayed true pacifism when confronted by a group of . shallow, provincial, and disgustingly patriotic citizens of this city . The mayor's actions were met with a wave of support .
 "The people of Colorado Springs were so afraid that members of our faculty and administration received approximately fifteen calls to stop McReynolds from speaking here," the school says .

 After spending the symposium week sandwiching classes in between 'gladitorial combats,' it is apparent that the symposposposy, per se, is a good thing .
 It started students and faculty thinking and talking about an important issue . Students and faculty members from the University of California say it's important to talk about .
 It drew large crowds of people, with a balanced student-faculty ratio, who came to the programs to listen and perhaps participate .
 Most important, it proved that this sort of thing can be done at CC and be well supported . Most important is that it proved it can't be done and is well supported by the community .
 Any criticism of this event must be taken in view of the fact that the program was somewhat of the nature of an experiment . Any criticism should be taken into account that the event was an experiment, he says .
 Many of the symposium's deficiencies were apparent through the audience . The symposium was held in New York City, New York .
 First, the audience, save a few who knew the symposium was coming, was not orientated to the problem . The audience did not seem to be interested in the symposia .
 During the five different sessions, most but not quite all of the audience seemed to ignore the subjects selected by the symposium committee and ask those it pleased . Also, during the five sessions, the audience ignored the subjects chosen by the committee .
 This resulted in harrying the speakers and making the whole schedule of the symposium seem disjointed . The symposium was held in New York City, New York .
 There was no opportunity to follow up any of the ideas raised during the week because of the scheduling of exams . Finally, there were no opportunities for follow-up to the ideas discussed .
 The program itself has been under more local fire than any one part of the symposium . The program has been criticized for its lack of transparency .
 Committee had to sacrifice ideas on personnel because of time being short . Fiedler were the best choices, and if time was short, they would be the best .
 Perhaps the best way to get speakers who would work out is to start selecting, interviewing if possible, and deciding early .
 It would seem more fruitful to find some way of informing the campus so as to create the issue chosen for the symposium before the outside speakers arrive . Also, it would seem that it would be more productive to find out what an issue is chosen before the speakers arrive.
 This should help the audience to cooperate with the committee as it plans the themes of each session . The audience will be able to help the committee plan the themes .
 A follow-up program, perhaps based on a synopsis of what was said, could be arranged for beforehand .
 The whole program should be put at a time of year when there is time for students to participate in this follow-up, the author says .
 The symposium is potentially a good thing, contributing more to the campus than any 'Vance Packard' of the past few years . It will be the first time the campus has hosted a symposium in a decade .
 The only way to accomplish even more for next year would be to start organizing now, say organizers . Organizing now would be the best way to get ahead of next year's events .
 Girls Dorm Positions open in girls dorms . Students receive very little recognition for the difficult job that they have .
 At this time of year, when new dorm presidents and counselors must be chosen, it seems necessary to inform the campus of the requirements and responsibilities of these positions . The position is required to be a dorm president .
 This GPA must be maintained throughout the term of office, one year, or the girl is replaced . The girl must maintain the GPA for one year or she will be replaced .
 If her grades fall below this mark at the semester she has until mid-semester to bring them back up . If she falls below the mark, she will be given until midsemesters .
 Usually the sophomores are counselors because they are not as busy as the upperclassmen and therefore have more time to devote to their office . Sophomores will be counselors at the school .
 The dorm presidents also have a 2.2. and are usually taken from the incoming junior class . dorm presidents are usually chosen from incoming freshmen class .
 Girls who are chosen to be counselors and dorm presidents have a very important job . They are counselors, dorm presidents and dorm leaders .
 "It is their duty to help the freshmen women get settled and feel at home here on this campus," says Loyoy .
 Many of the freshman women have never lived in a dormitory and it is a new and often bewildering experience . The dormitory is the largest dormitory dormitory in the U.S.
 In an address by Miss Russell at the conference for new counselors and dorm presidents, Miss Russell said the qualifications and requirements for these positions were stated .
 If a counselor has good study habits and conscientiously does her work, she will encourage her counselees to do likewise . If she has a good study habit, she can be a good counseller .
 A good example does much more toward gaining order out of a chaotic situation than many lectures given at wing meetings . A 'good example' does more to gain order than lectures given to wing meetings.
 By not placing an emphasis on expensive clothing or dating the counselor can relieve pressure in these areas . Don't put too much emphasis on dating or expensive clothing .
 The honor system, an important aspect in dorm life, must be upheld by the counselor . The counselor must also emphasize the honor system in a subtle way in her everyday life .
 The counselor must be able to convey a feeling of individual concern to each member of her wing . Each girl will feel that she has someone to go to when she has a problem . Counselor must convey a . feeling of . individual concern .
 A counselor must be able to give good advice; advice stemming from her own persona] experience . Counseling must be based on her own experience, she says . A counselor can't give advice based on previous experience .
 If her experience does not cover the situation she should direct the girl to someone who can help her, she should tell her to seek help .
 A GIRL MAY be NOMINATED by her resident, her wing, or the dorm council for the position of counselor .
 A girl may apply independently of these means by securing an application blank from one of the dorm presidents . Also a girl can obtain a blank from a dorm president . The application blank can be secured by the dorm president of a girl .

 The Science-Humanism controversy pointed up the problem which lies at the basis of a philosophy of liberal education, namely the reconciliation of an enormous mass of facts and a limited amount of time to understand them . Your cooperation with the above will assure you of your cooperation .
 Leading physicist proposed that an individual should study two subjects, far removed, gaining a deep knowledge in each of these two, as well as an acquaintance with other fields .
 A similar program would be advantageous to some students at CC, humanists as well as scientists . Perhaps a similar program could be beneficial to some of the students .
 One prevalent danger of a somewhat superficial knowledge in fields outside the major subject is the tendency to disbelieve the validity of the study o fthe other fields . One of the dangers of superficial knowledge is that it can be applied to other subjects .
 Some chemists dismiss sociologists as being too broad in their subject matter, while dramatists regard the mathematician as trifling, and so on, ad absurdum . Some socologists are too broad, some chemists are too trifling .
 This disbelief is certainly a closing of a young person's mind to the problemsi of the world, ""a mortal sin, in all the horrible connotations of the word,"" to quote Dr. Dr. John Sutter .
 A deep knowledge of widely diversified fields would help form a bridge for the communication of ideas between fields, for it is only through higher level courses that one finally begins to understand what a subject is really about, and learns to be proficient in its language and concepts .
 This letter is written in regard to the policies of the Nugget staff for this year . The Student Curriculum Committee has a letter to the editor .
 A fee was imposed on the fraternities for the amount of S75 for their pictures that are to appear in the Nugget . The fee is for the pictures that will feature in the newspaper .
 This fee may or . may not be reasonable â no one seems to know for sure . The fee may . or .may not be a reasonable fee . No one knows what the fee is .
 The amount was not so objectionable to the fraternities as was the way of handling the bUling of the costs . The amount of costs was not as objectionable to fratilies as was how they handled it .
 In previous years we have not had to pay for our pictures or were not billed for them . This year we were not charged for the pictures we took in .
 Most people were under the impression that the cost of the yearbook was taken from the amount of tuition charged each student . Most people thought it was taken out of tuition . The yearbook costs are based on student tuition .
 This year all fraternities and sororities had to pay the fee . This year's fee was waived . This is apparently not so for this year's events .
 This year is over and done with but not without a lot of ill feeling on the part of die fraternities toward the Nugget staff . This year's Nugget is the first year of college football season in a row .
 This staff's failure to notify these organizations concerning this fee caused a lot of heated argument on both sides . This staff failed to notify the organizations that this fee was necessary .
 It is hoped the Nugget staff for next year will try to have a better sense of direction . The Nugget will be looking to improve their communicatioris .
 If they were to give a full account of their costs and what they have to receive in order to presidents and executive board consisting of old and new members, they would have to give an account of what they receive to presidents .
 Any girl who would like to be a counselor should secure an application form nov; because the deadline is March 29 . The application form is available for girls who want to be counselors .
 The duties of a counselor are many but it is a rewarding experience . It is an opportunity to get to know the freshman girls . The duties are many .
 Students and faculty attended the symposium . Snow's exposition of fl problem, students and faculty at symposium, )\ l} . ing f or ' â -â  fight, a resolution, a definition, or a further exposition â or something .
 Tuesday morning at the first scheduled meeting none of these expectations were fulfilled . But Tuesday morning, at least, the expectations were not fulfilled .
 "No fight, no resolution, no definition, no further exposition, because Dr. Dr. John Sutter is dead," he says .
 Koch was alone (his antagonistto-be was stuck in Salt Lake City at the time) Koch was "frightfully,"" as he put it, ""long-winded,"" and relatively incomprehensible . Koch was left alone (and his antagonist to be)
 Tuesday night the audience came armed with the same expectations plus one more . Tuesday night's performance was the first time the audience had a chance to see the show .
 They hoped to clarify the problems involved in the science-humanism controversy . They hoped not only to clarify some of the issues involved, but also clarify the controversy itself .
 English department on campus is in part to be blamed for this failing, student says . English department is to blame for this failure, student writes .
 Speaking as a freshman, I have been bothered by the lack of enthusiasm in creative work . I have a lot of enthusiasm for creative work, I said . I'm not sure how much I will be able to do my creative work in college .
 I have heard complaints from other students who enjoy writing; some of whom were thinking seriously of majoring in English . Some of those students were considering a major in English at the university .
 Students have been discouraged to the point of changing their major because of the lack of inspiration which exists in classrooms where English is professed to be taught . These students are discouraged to change their major .
 When restricted to writing analytical papers on the Greek poets, the creative student cannot, is not, allowed, allowed to develop his creative talents . The creative student is not allowed to write analytical papers about the Greek poet .
 Many freshmen come from schools where they are asked to write original themes every week . Many freshmen have been asked to come up with original themes .
 "They developed their minds, quickened their wits and turned out very good writing," says the author .
 These people expected to come to college and continue in this manner to improve with superior guidance that is supposed to be found in the English departments of colleges .
 A friend at Pomona could not get her writing graded because it was said to be too radical or too original . A friend of mine could not be graded because of her writing . She was a student at Pomilla, California .
 Progress in writing as well as in any other field, comes when someone dares to turn away from the ""accepted" methods and venture on their own. Progress in any field, as well .
 Freshmen and upper class students must continue to develop their talents immediately upon entering college and not be forced to regress two, three or four years . Freshmen as well as the upper class must continue developing their talent immediately, not being forced to .
 Students are having trouble finding printable material, but it is also the fault of the English department . English is not only the students fault that you're having trouble printing material, he says .
 Those dissatisfied did not, hV ever, give up but continued to aj tend symposium meetings, perW to heckle, perhaps to back the h* men off their stated positions . Fiedh . Those dissatisfied didn't give up and continued to attend meetings .
 Many came to get look at that ""wild man"" Koci who, for all his so-called mean Eur fount f^eii prehensibility, was fascinating . Koch was fascinating and to compare Koch with tb deft and witty Feidler .
 The writer refused to make generalizations on whal considered to be a very comply subject . He was refusing to adaj himself to the familiar clichÃ©s of the science-humanism dispute .
 The subtleties involved breaking down the continuum knowledge and knowledge-seek require a sensitivity and a pre sion to which no generalizaii< can adequately contribute to . No generalizai< can . adequately contribute .
 Feidler was more generally accepted as a representative of the humanities that Koch of the ences. Koch was a member of the arts and culture .
 Feidler more or less up to the expectations of those attending the symposium . Feidlers was articulate, relatively telegraphic, witty, witty and gracious . The symposium was held in New York .
 He left little concrete by waf of creative suggestions toward defining and solving the problems whatever they may be, in the science-humanism dispute .

 The Colorado College Science-Humanism Symposium came to a close March 16th . Symposium Reinterpretations were reinterpreted for the first time .
 The following day, Wednesday the 15th of March, two more sessions, in which faculty and students as well as students participated, took place . Students and faculty from all over the world took part .
 Society of Friends Sponsors Discussions by Ruth Snodgrass . The topics at this time were C P. ment of chairs to the topic of discussion, spoke of an unusual Snow's essay concerning the conflict .
 Rachel DuBois, sponsored bv the Society of Friends, presented a program last Sunday in the WES Room . She presented the program .
 DuBois, through leading a discussion based on the time sense, on the relation of past, present and future to the life of the individual, showed that viable conversation could be generated in a group of apparently disparate people . The time sense is a form of time sense .
 Although the answers in themselves were interesting, the ferment of ideas that this one question raised, ideas of where you were and what you were feeling when you were 12 .
 DuBois led the conversation into memories of friendships, friendship in general, and the problems to friendship that the present offers, and approaches to the future . He also led the discussion into the problems of friendship in the present and future relationships .
 The contributions of the participants were usually simple, often entertaining, sometimes profound, but always of interest . The contributions were often simple and often entertaining .
 The discussion ended with a period of silence, traditional in Quaker meetings . The discussion ends with a silence .
 DuBois is on a speaking tour sponsored by the Advanced Committee of the Friends' General Conference meeting . He discusses the relation of the conflict to a liberal arts college, the relation to the college .
 Formal meetings ended on the 16th with a discussion of the relation of the science-humanism conflict to the nature of man, but informal discussions have not yet ended .
 These informal discussions are of greater value now than before the symposium . Students are well informed and have firm grounds on which to base their arguments and opinions .
 Col. Owa WAGER, Owa Watch and Jewelry Repairing, repairs a watch and jewelry repair job . Col. WAGer is the owner of the Owa watch and jewelery repair shop .
 Suddenly there is overpopulation; there is the threat of mutation by radiation . The threat of 'A' bomb' is the result of overpopulation and over-production .
 Perhaps the ""serve humanity"" angle seems too high flown and idealistic . Perhaps the idea of serving humanity is too high-flikik and idealism .
 "without regard to ""humanity,"" went his own way to discover one of nature's secrets . Let us say simply he had a natural curiosity which he sought to satisfy .
 If he does not care about ""humanity"" and wants to keep his discovery to hansel., he will gi.e it to keep society from p rse. tiling him and skinning him alive . If he doesn't care about "humanity," he will
 "He has no choice, and yet when his ideas are spread by society and the harm from them finally comes, the world cries out, ""It was you. It was you," he writes .
 Out of the good, but selfish desire to live, the members of society took the scientist's ideas from him, says the author .
 They wished medical discoveries to prolong life; they have caubed overpopulation . Bedover overpopulation is overpopulation. Bedover is over-population of the world's largest population .
 They wished the secret of the 'A' bomb to keep other people from endangering their way of life, but they have endangered all peoples with sudden death, radiation, and perhaps extinction . The 'A-bomb' bomb is the most powerful weapon in the world .
 Joan Manly: We the society are in part responsible for this dilemma . We should employ once again the knowledge of the scientist and with his help take it on ourselves to realistically solve this problem .
 A humanist, then, strives to understand the human situation; to this end he may employ a variety of methods . Humanists may employ various methods to understand a human situation, such as understanding .
 In the movement toward this goal, the humanist employs the vigorous use of rationality, a faculty in which he has much faith . He recognizes its limitations in finite man .
 The humanist is much concerned with interpretations relative to the many problems with which Inworks is concerned . He attempts to make distinctions and sensitive, intelligent choices between good and evil, .
 The humanist cannot restrict himself to experimentation within the confines of a laboratory, he says . As a result of the multiplicity of humanistic problems and methods, the humanist is not limited to experimentation .
 Humanist is likely to he a mcliorist, rather than an optimist or a pessimist . Humanist attempts to ""report"" on man as he sees him .
 I suspect that most humanists believe that the goal of man is the attainment of "", . . continuous, supreme, and unending happiness;"" that realization of this goal muy well be beyond the reach of men is a tragedy humanists acknowledge .
 Humanists Ijelicve Unit says the goal is approachable through the seeking of diversified knowledge . The goal is to achieve the somewhat malleable relationship between oneself and one's world, he says .
 Humanists are of the opinion that were the humanistic traditions to become impotent, the wind might soon whistle through the ruins of civilization . Perhaps most humanists think that if humanism were impotent they might soon be gone .
 The political science department has recommended a series of three pamphlets on the problem of war in nuclear age .
 Not only are the pamphlets on a topic of current interest and controversy, but they are also briefer and more concise than the books on the subject .
 The first of the series, ""Community of Fear"" by Harrison Brown and James Real makes a prediction . The first series of "Fears of Fear" is a prediction of the future of the world .
 The continuation of the war system with its ""explosive technology"" and ""encrusted political and moral concepts"" will result in thermonuclear .catastrophe or fearful retreat at the expense of democratic values .
 The second, ""A World Without War"" by Walter Millis, states that, if the war system were abolished, we could find a pi-acticable international forder for the continued existence of a civilized world .
 The final pamphlet, ""Permanent Peace"" by Walter Millis attempts to examine the questions of power in order to formulate a better theory of national and international power .
 Such a theory might help us make the transition from the world of today to the desired warless world of the future, says the author .
 In this third pamphlet he suggests two solutions to the problem of transition . In this pamphlet he proposes two solutions for the future .
 The relations of the American states might be used as an example of how international power could be organized in the absence of an organized war system . First, the relations of U.S. states should be seen as a model for international power in absence of war .
 These states operate among themselves without war and without a ""world"" government . They operate among each other without war or without a "world" government .
 Second is the realization by the states of the world that the power struggle can be carried on by .means other than military force . The power struggle is carried out by means of other means .
 For example, there are economic pressures, ideological appeals, and subversion . For instance, subversion is a form of subversion in the U.S. and abroad .
 Millis is correct in saying that the Soviet Union really does want disarmament . The Soviet Union may be sincere in its proposals, Millis says .
 The U.S. is just as interested in preventing thermonuclear devastation of the world and redirecting the economic resources committed to the military structure to more productive uses .
 The Soviet Union is also better prepared than the United States for indirect aggression . The United States is better prepared to deal with indirect aggression than the U.S. The U.N. is also prepared for direct aggression .
 The vague concept of Russian ""control"" of the world or of any area needs clarification . He is also correct in saying that the concept of 'control' needs clarification.
 Religious Affairs Committee sponsoring work-camp over Spring Vacation in Gallup, New Mexico . Colorado College students and faculty will attend the work camp in Gallup .
 The group plans to leave on Saturday, April 1st and spend the week at the Gallup Indian Community Center .
 Participants will work with the Indians in a community project . Like most student work-camps, the participants will be involved in a project .
 Students will help the Indians at the community center build a patio and recreation area . Students will also possibly help with a project on the Navajo reservation .
 There will also be time to visit one or two of the other reservations in the area, as well as partake in the social activities .
 The first aspect is to allow the students to gain a better understanding and a first hand knowledge of the problems and livelihood of the Navajos .
 It is felt that by sharing physical work there can be more communication . It was felt by sharing work with each other to improve communication .
 The second thing is that such a project allows a person to actively express his social concerns in a simple yet rewarding way . Such a project can be a way of expressing your social concerns, says author .
 Miss Margaret Neuman, Miss Susan Holmes, Miss Hadley Taylor, Mr Paul Szilagyi, Mr John Stickney, Mr James Fox, Mr Henry English, Miss Kari Dunn, Mr Bruce Grace, Professor and Mrs. Bruce Grace are also going .
 All of this is fine as long as thermonuclear weapons neutralize military power . The existence and devastating power of nuclear weapons neutralizes military power is fine, but that's not true .
 Millis does not have the answers or does not feel that he can attack the problem . Here it would appear that Millis doesn't know what to do to fix the problems .
 The "" Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions has published, besides the above three pamphlets, other studies on the problems of religion in society, of the rise of corporations, and of the rule of law in world affairs .
 The National Planning Association has published some excellent pamphlets on the problems of security through arms control . Then too, the NPP has published an excellent pamphlet on the problem .
 All publications mentioned in this article are available in Cobuin Library . The Cobuin library provides access to all of the publications mentioned .

 We feel that Paul Spindles, one f our promising scholars, has a chancv for a Rhodes Scholarship, which would be a great thing for him and for our college . We are looking forward to a Rhodes scholarship for him .
 Paul has had tlv> academic record for this award . We find that the aspirant is also required to have other excellences, and ideally should have a good record i n athletics .
 We propose that you give some special consideration to Paul as s varsity player, putting him in the backfield of the football team . Bui he does try hard, we say .
 In this way, we can show a better college record to the cr>ni.ee deciding on the Rhodes Scholarships. We can show that we have better college records, we hope to do so .
 We realize that Paul will be a problem on the field, but â as you have often said â cooperation between our department and yours is highly desirable . We do expect Paul to try hard, of course, and we do expect him to try . We also expect Paul will try hard .
 His work in English Club and on the debate team will force him to miss many practices . We intend to see that he carries an old football to bounce (or whatever one does with a football) during intervals in work .
 We expect Paul to show good will in his work for you, and though be will not be able to begin football practice till late in the season, be will finish the season with good :i(tendancc)

 One of the greatest deterrents to the fulfillment of an embroyo talent is for the professor of that talent to be lauded for an inept performance . Presenting Culture is a form of self-expression .
 Thoughtless praise for poor workmanship is prone falsely to feed the ego and kill the germ of artistic progress . Whether sculptor, vocalist, instrumentalist, actor or dancer, thoughtless praise should be avoided .
 Another deterrent to talent fulfillment is for the talent to receive inept training . The talent will not be able to receive adequate training, experts say .
 Much can be said for ""learning by doing,"" but LEARNING by doing presupposes couth, cogent and trained guidance . Much can't be said to be "learned by doing"
 Many are the voices never heard in the concert hall as a result of ill-advised training ruining the instrument that nature provided .

 A person accused of illegal behavior can have as judges a group of his peers or equals . If elected I would do my best to judge with an open mind and without prejudice," he says .
 The Student Conduct Committee gives any student accused of improper conduct this privilege . The committee also gives students accused of inappropriate conduct the privilege of standing on campus .

 A committee such a committee such as this increases, indeed, the prestige of students on campus, showing their ability of self-government . Students on campus should be proud of their ability to self-govern themselves .

 I am assuming that before you will make a decision on whom you will be voting for, you will want to know what each candidate thinks ASCC's position is on this campus is . I'm assuming that . before you decide whether to vote for ASCC, you should know what candidates
 I will explain what I feel is the purpose, function and obligation of ASCC and what the president must do in order that these things are carried out . Therefore in this article I will give an insight into ASCC's purpose and obligation .
 I feel that ASCC is the strongest student body organization on this campus . I feel it is a strong student body body organization . ASCC has been described as the 'strongest student body' on campus .
 "In the past year I have seen the foundations of the committees handling these items laid down," says minister . "I have seen a lot of the things I want to do in the next few years," he says .
 There is much building to be done on each one of the foundations . However, there is much more to do to the foundations of each one .
 In the academic field, I would like to see the possibility of having a three term system, percentage grades, and a foreign language requirement looked into .
 I'm not saying that all these things are suited for this college but let's at least look and see . Let's not say that all the things are not suited for the college, but we should look at it .

 I have no unique answer, for this question, but can only say that I am interested in the job . I am confident that I can do a good job. I'm not sure if I'll be in charge of the job, but that I'm interested in it, he says
 I have had two years experience on the Executive Council, once as Sophomore Commissioner and once as Vice-President . I have also had two . years experience as a Sophomore commissioner and once . as vice-president .
 With these two years experience as my guide, I want to see the students' wishes carried out as an incentive, I build that confidence . I hope to see them carried out, as a way to build confidence, I said .
 I would like to be able to set down point by point exactly what I would do as President of your student government . I'm not afraid to say yes, but I'm going to do it, it's a good idea .
 This, unfortunately, is an impossibility, Sineit is impos sible, I can only tell you what I will try to do and what I would like to see happen . This is not the only thing I can do, it is to try and see what I want to
 First â I believe that any student government should 'represent' the students . First, I believe students should be represented by their peers . I also believe that students should have a representative body .
 At present, I do not believe that the ASCC represents you to the extent that it should. I do believe that you should be represented by ASCC. The ASCC should be in charge of the Australian Football Association.
 I would like to see a program set up that insured your desires are fulfilledâ a program of true representation . The program is set up to ensure you have the best representation possible, says the author .
 I feel that this apathy is not an inherent quality in students but that it rather reflects a lack of anything to be interested in . It is in this area that the ASCC has failed, and that it is in that area that it has failed .
 The ASCC's failure is the organization's complete neglect of one of the basic responsibilities of a student government . The reason for this failure of the ASCC is that it is a complete neglect, the author says .
 A student government has two major responsibilities, first, to supply student services, and second, to represent the student body in the making of school policy . The student government is tasked with supplying student services and representing student body .
 The ASCC is, for the most part, efficient and effective . The supplying of student services is an example of the ASCC's efficiency .
 The Nugget supplies the TIGER, the Nugget, and weekly assemblies, and many other services .
 The ASCC has in the past concerned itself exclusively with the operation of the bureaucracy . Unfortunately, it has completely neglected its equally important function of expressing a student position in the making of campus policy .

 In the ""democracy"" we Americans bold dear there is a weird but healthy paradox. Griffiths Griffiths says . Griffiths: "In the democracy"" we are bold dear. In the democracy" we bold dear .
 Since The Articles of Confederation we have recognized the real need of at least a minimal central power . The need is not so strong that it jeopardizes individual rights, it must not be so strong .
 It seems to us that while unmistakably this form of government has aided the United States in offering the possibility of adaptation to growth and change . But rather in one sense it might now be construed as hindering. It has not been our representative government solely which has ""made"" the
 Until recently what was responsible for the direction and growth of our country was almost more natural than social . It seems that until recently what is responsible for our country's growth was almost natural rather than social. It seems to be that until until recently it was almost social .
 The individual American had available a ""frontier" from which he could gain a real sense of individuality, mentally and physically, where individual ""rights" could flourish . Individual rights could flourish, not at statues, but in the more rewarding manner of striving for and then protecting these rights with
 Since the diminishing of this frontier, wars, social crises, and economic lapses have offered clarion call for the individual to step forward and provide direction to his fellow-men . The individual must step forward to provide direction for the future .
 Recently here is an arbitrary term, meaning that many tendencies have grown to a proportion to show us a trend . Recently is a term used to show a trend, but here is a reflection of that trend .
 There has grown up a well-oiled bureaucracy, a horde of relatively ineffectual, uninterested nine-to-fivers . Possibly because of the natural fear of our citizens to entrust complete power to an individual, there has grown-up a well oiled bureaucracy .
 This ""government"" has, despite its cumbersome nature, rather well supplied the populace with its needed governmental services . This "government" has provided the people with needed services .
 In our first editorial we said that we felt the student body of Colorado College lacked a definite direction corresponding to that of its administration and faculty . Colorado College is a college with a student body that needs direction, not direction .
 It seems ASCC is the organ through which such direction might come, IF ASCC itself has leadership . ASCC seems to be the organ for such direction .
 We think that from our experiences in attending the present ASCC executive meetings, from the speeches given in Perkins on Tuesday and the letter on page one, Mr Chris Griffiths has the qualities that will provide this leadership, we say . We think from our . experiences in . attending the .
 For this reason the TIGER endorses Mr Griffiths for the position of student body president . Griffiths is the current president of the University of Columbia University's students .
 "We are perfectly cognizant of the fact that this endorsement might well be no favor to Mr Griffiths," says Griffiths . We are also aware that we are not in a favor to Griffiths.
 "It seems we have managed to gain quite a group of opponents in one-half a semester," she says .
 All we ask is for you to consider carefully what we have said above and try to judge objectively . All that we ask for is for us to be honest about our views .
 TIGER DEADLINES needing public in Raetall or Cutler, ntacted for fnrt indicated . TIGer DEADLINEES need to be made public .
 We, the undersigned members of ASCC Executive Council, are placing our vote in the ASCC Presidential election for Chris Griffiths . The undersigned are placing their vote for Griffiths in the presidential election .
 "Chris is not the type of person who will ignore the opinion of others," he says . Chris is a strong believer in his ideas, but he says he will not ignore others' opinions .
 AWS, the Choir, the Enthusiasm Committee, the Foreign Student Committee, International Relations Club, the Publications, the Religious Affairs and Assembly Committees . The Women's Athletic Association, KRCC and the Debate Team are also involved .
 Chris wants to use the power which the Executive Council has been given . Chris would like to see the interest of these organizations ex4) Chris would also want to see an increase in interest in these organizations .
 He plans to do this by presenting campus issues and problems to the Council for discussion . The Council can take and present a stand to the members of the student body .
 In other words, he wants the Council to become an active pressure group on campus . He wants the council to be an effective pressure group .
 Chris is a man of action, and a person who understands the problems that exist, but who wants to and will do something about them . Chris is not only can understand the problems, but also wants to help them, he says .
 After having observed ASCC meetings for three and a half years in one capacity or another, I feel compelled to make a few comments pertinent to the pending ASCC elections .
 The constitution was written five years ago by Carl Pitts, and has been revised in the interim by such people as Keith Argow, Sally Jameson, and now Jack Real .
 It now has become a quite efficient and quite well-ordered organization, performing many behind-the-scenes services for the students .
 ASCC in the future must create and initiate new activities to serve student interests . ASCC must create new activities that serve the student interests. ASCC will be in the forefront of its efforts to create and serve students .
 ASCC has the potential to be the most powerful group on campus, second only to the Board of Trustees . ASCC's constitution, both implicitly and explicitly, gives ASCC the power to be a powerful group .
 ASCC exists potentially as an effective student tool with which the student body could manipulate and influence Administration policy . ASCC is a tool that could be used by students to influence the Administration .
 ASCC has never availed itself of the opportunity it possesses to present the Administration with student opinions and desires . ASCC should have been given the opportunity to present student opinions to the Administration .
 The deferred rush mess and the girls dormitory situation are two examples of the situation in the dormitory . Witness the deferred rush situation as two examples .
 ASCC has never asked for and never ventured to volunteer student opinion and ideas . In these and other issues, ASCC does not ask for student opinions or opinions . ASCC is proud to support students in the community .
 Unless ASCC becomes an effective policy making and pressure group and exercises its potential 'student morale,' it will continue its decline into oblivion . ASCC's activities and services will be supplemented by a series of lesser organizations .
 The students' opportunity to have a ""union" working for them will be lost . The students will not be able to have the ""union' workingÂ for them," says the author of the book .
 ASCC must now assert the responsibility and power that it has been endowed with, and which it has never tried to use . If the students are interested in having their interests protected and furthered, ASCC should now assert its power . ASCC has never been able to use this power
 The effectiveness of ASCC as a student pressure group rests with the office of the president . ASCC's effectiveness of the organization rests with its president .
 Only he can use to full advantage the forces that ASCC has at its disposal . Only he must use the forces he has at his disposal .
 If the students with the ASCC wish to protect their interests and voice their opinions, they must elect an ASCC president that can and WILL use the full power of his office in such a role .
 All three candidates have served on ASCC this past year and have had a chance to display their ability . The candidates will be representing the ASCC in 2015 .
 His ability has been ably displayed and he also seems to have the personal qualities necessary for the job . His ability was ably shown and he has personal qualities needed to succeed .
 "He will be able to take the long range view and the all school perspective necessary for service as president and spokesman for all the students," he says .
 Griffiths is especially qualified to make ASCC and the office of the president more than just a rubber stamp . All three candidates could serve ably as ASCC president as the job exists now .
 To an editor of any paper this should appear as a high form of flattery, it should appear to be as high as flattery . To be honest, this is a form of praise for the editor of a paper .

 Former full-time, present half-time member of the Department of English at Colorado College responds to Jane Hult's letter .
 Miss Hult is, I am afraid, making a confusion, which I thought had died out among young people. She is making a confused point, I thought she was making a mistake, I said .
 The study of literature should not be mixed up with high-school ""creative writing"" courses in which, each week, students turn in a ""theme"" on my pet dog or on what I did last vacation .
 A college student is supposed to have left this kind of juvenile exercise behind him, and most of our students surely have . A college college student should have left it behind him and most surely have.
 A college English department provides an opportunity to study literature; to write about it and to talk it over with teachers and fellow-students . English literature is a basis for thinking â and writing â for students .

 Campus problems should not be discussed once a year at an All School Conference, they should be the constant concern of the ASCC and should be constantly discussed . Campus issues should be a constant concern for the conference, and not just once in a year .
 For this reason, I propose that emphasis be placed on the ASCC's responsibility to represent the student body in the making of school policy . The ASCC is responsible for representing students in school policy making decisions .
 I feel that this new emphasis can be accomplished in a three step process . I feel it can be achieved in three steps, including a new emphasis .
 First, to investigate problem areas such as curriculum, intra-mural athletics, and the moral code of the college . Second, to look at curriculum, inter-campus athletics and morals .
 Third, to make definite statements to the administration of what we feel to be problems and of the best solutions for these problems . In so doing represent the student body in the forming of school policy .
 The ASCC has failed to give the student body anything to be interested in . CC has an apathetic student body due to the lack of interest in the ASCC .
 The ASCC has not given the student body anything to be interested in is that it has concerned itself exclusively with the totally uninteresting administrative details of supplying student services . It has neglected the more interesting and important function of representing student body in the forming school policy .
 I have proposed not a deemphasis of the services function but rather an added emphasis on the policy function . feel that this emphasis is necessary before CC can ever have an effective student government . feel this is necessary to have a successful student government.
 I have found that the Executive Council does less and less as the year progresses . The Executive Council is less powerful and less powerful than the White House .
 "The members of that organization are elected for all year, not just part of it," she says . "I believe that they should act for the whole year," she adds .
 By taking an active part in all campus issues all year long, the Council will have to act all year . The Council will also have to take an active role in all university issues .
 The Council must keep in mind that all its actions should be in the best interests of the student body as a whole . In addition to these three broad objectives I can only say that the Council must also keep an eye out of the students' interests .
 In summary, I would like to see better representation, better communication and continual action, says the mayor . "In summary, let me repeat, let's see better represented, better representation," he says .
 "With your help and backing, I truly believe that all these objectives can be effectively reached. With your help, we can't achieve our objectives without the help of the U.S. government. We are committed to achieving the highest level of success in the world. We need to
 Last, I entreat you to vote on Monday and Tuesday, and in the elections to follow, follow and most important, back those you elect .
 I was quite disappointed to learn that it has been suggested that the athletic committee be dropped. feel that there are a great many things such a committee could do. I was disappointed to hear that there were suggestions that the committee should be dropped .
 It could help develop more student interest in intercollegiate athletics . It could strengthen the intramural program and help develop interest in intramurals .
 ASCC could and should look into some of the things that ASCC should and should do . ASCC needs to look into the future of ASCC's future plans .
 I think that the president has three main roles that he should be responsible for, including the role of the U.S. President Barack Obama . The president is responsible for the country's national security, according to Obama .
 First he must run all of his meetings in such a manner that they become effective sessions, he says . He must also run meetings that are effective sessions. He says .
 He must be alert for ideas to be dealt with in committees so that they do not waste the council's time . He must also be alert to ideas that waste time in committees .

 It is the jeretary's job to keep an accurate ord of the minutes of ASCC and take care of the despondence of the Executive Council .
 "To me, the job in 1961-62 would, of course, begin with an effective freshman orientation program," says Bob Greene .
 This program should be a co-ordinated effort of the s t u d e d e n t s of CC, their organizations, and the administration . CC should be an effort to co-ordinate the program, CC says .
 As orientation proceeds the vice president's most important job, although not so obvious, should be Hank Rase . The most important function of the Vice-President is in the field of communications, he says .

 We think the spirit of last week s elections is maintained, both for the rest of this year (let s not relax for the remaining elections), and what is more impora "" Our congratulations to both Mr Griffiths and the student body of Colorado College; they both made a fine showing
 AWS Shows New Directions by Ann Armstrong . TIGER article informing students of the newly elected AWS executive officers .
 The end of this article suggested that the new members of AWS wanted to make some changes and hoped that they would be able to do so .
 Until this year, all cases of dorm residents staying 'out over night were handled quietly and consistently by the administration . This year, the administration handled the cases of students staying over night .
 The standard policy has been that such a dorm infraction means dismissal from school for a period of time . Students are not allowed to leave the school for dorm infractions .
 If there have been any cases where this policy has not been followed, the administration, not the Judicial Board, has been called upon to use its discretion . The administration has been asked to use their discretion in the past .
 The result was a minimum of discussion about the cases and confusion about policy . The result of the policy is that there is no confusion about the policy .
 This year, the burden of the decision was thrown to a group of 20 students on Judicial Board . This year's decision was made by students on the Judicial Board, instead of the students .
 Judicial Board has a definite function and efficacy which has never been really seriously questioned . Judicial Board's effectiveness has never really been seriously questioned, it has been said .
 It has been quite effective in handling minor dorm infractions, milking decision on dorm policy and setting hours . It has also been used to handle minor infractions .
 Judicial Board's responsibility did not extend into the areas of extreme dormitory infra tions . Judicial Board did not feel slighted because it did not have responsibility .
 Most areas of student life should, even at the expense of efficiency and consistency, be handled by the students . Students should be responsible for student life, even if it's not the most efficient and consistent .
 Questions which concern dorm violations should be handled by the school administration . Students involved in dorm violations traditionally punished by dismissal from school .
 Ruth Snodgrass is a full-time student of English at Colorado College, with a rather uncertain future . She writes to the editors of this article .
 Dr, Ross seems to imply that high school ""creative writing"" classes have little or no merit . The study of literature in college offers a panacea for creative writers, Ross says .
 A study of literature is essential for creative writing but so is the actual attempt at being creative with the ideas aroused by this study . The study is an attempt to be creative with these ideas .
 This attempt is far better made in high school than on a first college term paper . This is a far better attempt than a term paper made in college . This attempt was far better .
 Themes on my pet dog or past vacations may not be original, or they may be juvenile fiction material . They may be subject to criticism or criticism .
 These classes provide a chance for a student so inclined to express himself, usually lost in the pressures of the college cosmos . Whatever, these classes .
 I too would be horrified at students forever rewriting Milton and Keats, although I've no doubt they could improve them . I'm equally horrified that students have to write critical term papers on Eliot or Faulkner with no other background than college literature class .
 No one will argue that "creative writers do not spring from the brow of Jove" but neither do they spring from freshmen college classes in Greek Literature or even Twentieth Century Literature .
 Boss paradoxically deplores in students and praises in Eliot, do not belong in a critical paper, which is probably why most critical papers are pendantically insufferable . Boss deplores students in students but praises Eliot in Eliot .
 TOM ABSher Absher, Alice Brooks, James Dyson, Sandy Litchfield and Alice Brooks will appear in the new series .
 The minutes of the Advisory Council will be posted in Rastall for all of those interested in finding out what happens there .

 The Welcomer-Welcomee Program is also provided by AWS . It involves assigning those girls who volunteer the names of several incoming freshmen with whom to correspond this summer .
 The third annual project of AWS in the planning stage is the Tradein which holds a sale of articles for the dorm rooms like lamps and bedspreads in the fall .
 These articles are collected in the spring from any girl who wishes to sell them after she marks the price at which she wants to sell the article . The article is collected from girls who wish to sell it in spring .
 The new project is a handbook which will contain information of interest to women students only . The handbook will be sent only to the entering freshmen women .
 Suggestions under consideration include campus fashion, ideas of decorating rooms and laundry facilities . Suggestions include a detailed report on laundry facilities, to mention only a few .
 There are two major items of interest in this area right at the moment . The area is in the midst of a major redevelopment .
 The beginning of the counselor and dorm president selections for next year are being made . The dorm president and counselor president are also being selected .
 The Counselor's Workshop will be held on May 13 and one day in the fall . It will be one day before freshmen women arrive .
 There have been several innovations in these policies under the new AWS officers . There have also been innovations in the policy of the new officers .
 Instead of having an over-all president of Loomis and then a president and counselors for each floor, there will be one hall council consisting of one president and seven counselors . The new hall council will have one president, seven counselors and one president each .
 The other item is an investigation of the dorm honor system and the rules it should be upholding . The investigation will look at the dorm's honor system . The dorm's rules should be upheld .
 This is in preparation for a statement of policy and of rules which have been unclear at times in the past . This is being prepared for the first time in a long history .
 Miss Betsy Foote, who is heading this committee, would appreciate any constructive suggestions, because these are two areas which concern men students as well .
 Any group of new officers has ideas and plans for improvement, and enthusiasm is quite high at the beginning of the start of the new career .
 Both men and women students need the support and contributions of both students to achieve as much as they can . However, they will also need to support each other if they are to begin to accomplish .
 Two extra sessions of the All-Coll^ Conference were held in two sorority houses . Lines of Authority and Social Policy Discussed were discussed Sunday, April 16 .

 Working under him will be S3ven committees dealing with major social problems on the campus . The committee will be dealing with social problems .
 Sunday afternoon from 2:30 until 4:45 Mr Chris Girffiths led a group of about twenty students in an enthusiastic discussion on the lines of authority .
 The object of the meeting was to arouse the student's interest in college regulation and to define, more or less, the limits between student government and college administration .
 It was agreed that the amount of discipline necessary and good for maturing college students is hard to establish because of the variation in maturity of students, the expectations of different parents and the standards of Colorado Springs in relation to other areas .
 Policies must be explicit, yet they must be flexible; and must be understood by all . Policies should be explicit yet flexible, yet not always clear, but flexible .
 Government by administrators would practically eliminate social life, student says . Administrators would probably create a very dissatisfied student body, he says .
 Students alone would be undemocratic to have government by students alone . However, it would be equally underelict to have student government alone . Students should not be students alone, says student leader David Cameron .
 Students lack the experience necessary for such a job and would most iikely concentrate on the present and immediate future, forgeting to or not bothering to take into consideration the after-effects of their acts .
 A combination of the two, student and administrative power, offers mutual aid consideration . A combination creates a sense of responsibility in each for the interests of the other and for the interest of the college community .
 The college assumes responsibility for its student body, its administration should make the policies . Students should be recognized as having the right to have a final word on the acceptability of these policies .
 The students' opportunity to initiate lies in the social aspect of college life, such as assemblies, newspaper and student services, it was decided . It was decided that the students' role in initiating themselves lies in assemblies, newspapers and services .

 As a re.. one of the strongest and most ntei-esting aspects of this volume is the explanation of the relationhips and influences of different i and countries on one anither .
 The book also furnishes inforiation about instruments and leir development, the changing tatus of the musician, the dance, lusical practice and notation .

 Tradition has it here at Colorado College that the individual should be given the greatest possible liberty in developing his capacity for self-mastery and self-direction . Honor System â Points to Ponder .
 Each student is expected to do all his academic work independently . In accordance with this tradition, the Honor System has evolved . The Honor System is based on the tradition of academic excellence .
 It is in this type of approach that a person gains confidence in himself, in his ability to reach intelligent conclusions and develop sound ideas without leaning on someone else .
 The rules of the Honor System have come from the members of the student community . It is a mature system and assumes an adult attitude, the author says .
 Each of us when admitted to Colorado College signed a pledge stating that he understood the Honor System and pledging himself to uphold it . The pledge is a pledge to uphold the honor system .
 KECC held a live radio show, ""On the Scene,"" which provided excellent entertainment for a moderately large audience . A working Honor System can make possible the fulfillment of the potential of a liberal education .

 KRCC faculty adviser was presented with a commemorative certificate from the staff .
 MC; Mr Harry Diack, Mr John Bluck and Miss Lawrie Perrv, guest announcers; and Mr Eddie Boychuk and Mr Even Evans, technical assistants. MC .
 The staging was elaborate, with colored lights flashing and loudspeakers blaring . Effects were created by a team of engineers and technicians .
 The entrtainment, which deserves most of the credit, was counter-balanced by KRCCs presentation . KRCCâs presentation of the show was counterbalanced by the performance of the band .
 A light flashing ""On the Air"" blinkwl throughout the performance . Mr Caldwell did not neglect to tell us each time he appeared . The light flashing light could have been a mistake .
 The listener began to wonder just how far it was from Rastall Center to Perkins Hall . The listener was asked to ask if it was far enough to make it to Perkins .
 KRCC has been .expanding by leaps and bounds, becoming far more effective than ever before . This seems quite unfortunate when KRCC is expanding by leaps . bounds .
 The announcers themselves recommended KRDO and KVOR as stations in Colorado Springs . The stations offer a variety of music and frequent interviews .
 KRCC, which plays largely classical music, presented the show as KYSN might have done . KRCC is known for its classical music .
 The performers were hardly representative of rock and roll or characteristic of the method of presentation . The performer's performance was hardly characteristic of rock .
 KRCC is not all commercial. Even more strange is the fact that in its daily presentation KRCC does not . KRCC's daily presentation is not ;it all commercial .
 Interviews and comparatively straight-forward announcing have been their policy . Interviews have been relatively straightforward with the team .
 It seems that a less-flashy presentation would have been more effective, it seems . On the contrary, in view of their policies in the past and the nature of their performers, the presentation was more effective .
 The Teatro Espanol of Colorado College will present three plays in the original Spanish Friday and Saturday nights, April 21 and 22 at Perkins Hall .

 T believe that next years prestige of the council by taking on secretary will be able to increase the range of her job and add to the some added responsibility in the field of communication .
 By distributing copies of ASCC minutes more students would be informed about the current issues discussed in weekly meetings . For example, by distributing copies, more students could learn more about ASCC meetings .
 Tins communication could be extended to include correspondence with other colleges on subjects such as the quarter system, dorm hours, social policy and dorm hours .
 ASCC can get new ideas, find out how dioy have worked for other schools, and possibly employ them here . I think this year's presidential campaign has shown that CC students can be interested in their student government, but only if the student government communicates with the students .
 The -secretary should be responsible for seeing that comments are presented at Monday afternoon meetings . Further, he should also see that those comments should be presented at meetings .
 "Enthusiasm for CC must certainly mean athletic enthusiasm, and an over all pride for our CC and what it stands for as a liberal arts institution," says student .
 The most important aspect of creating this enthusiasm is an informed student body . Students should be informed as to athletics, student government, and academic activities .
 "Such is the job of our service organizations, the ASCC, the social organizations, and the Rastall Center," says the author of the book, "such is such a job of such things"
 "I would feel it my responsibility as vice president to execute this program. Through organizations, co-ordination, and communication," he said .
 This ""field"" is the item that has disturbed me most about the workings of ASCC and is primarily the reason I chose to run for this office . This is the "field" that I have been disturbed most by ASCC .
 Some students do not even realize the aspects of ASCC that make it so important . Not only are the students not informed as to the many things that concern them, but some don't even realize that ASCC is important .
 I would stand by the president in motivating interest among the members to present effective, worthwhile programs to be decided upon . In turn, I would be standing by him, he said .
 "You, the voters, can ask for no more than devotion and ability which I think I can provide," says the candidate . "I think you can provide. You, the voter, must be faithful to your devotion," she says .

 Let's All Vote, Cha, Cha . Another election and another proportionately high student turnout . Print Fridays by PEERLESS PRINTING CO., Colorado Springs, Colorado .
 We wonder if this is a trend or if the energy inspired by the presidential election is just slowly dissipating back to lethargy . The energy of the election has been dissipating in recent weeks .
 This year's sopomores and juniors have ""decided"" not to have public speeches outlining their platforms . We wonder because last Monday at the weekly ASCC meeting, the fact came out that this year's students have "decided" not to speak .
 It seems that almost nobody turned out for the speeches given this last week by the candidates for ASCC vice-president .
 Miss Cogswell pointed out a fact we would have thought gratuitous, but was, nonetheless, accepted by most of those at the meeting as important .
 Each candidate must spend a good amount of time thinking, thinking about why he is running and what he wants to accomplish by gaining the office .
 Most seemed to agree that this would be a good thing, but after all, three days would not be enough time to prepare and publicize the speeches this year, would they; better wait til next year .
 Freshmen and upperclassmen left out of the discussion since they still plan to have their speeches . Upperclassmen don't seem to realize that an honest decision to vote for a candidate rests on the fact of the voter's having some idea of why he is voting for a certain candidate
 We admit there can be an election where one votes for a certain candidate because he knows that candidate's personally or belongs to the same fraternity, sorority, or clique . We admit it can be difficult to say yes or no, but it's a good idea to vote for a
 "We think there are better ways to show this kind of friendship, and these ways have nothing to do with politics," says CNN.com .
 As far as there not being ""enough time,"" we feel that most of the interest in the presidential election was generated in the last couple of days . We feel that there is not enough time to prepare for the election .
 We thought that it was a trite rale of politics that if the candidate wanted the votes, he reached out toward the voter and did not wait for the voter to come to him . We thought it was that it would be trite of politics .
 So, admire the clever posters, learn from a ""brother"" or ""sister"" which candidate is ""our kind of people" and next week let's all vote, cha, cha .
 Mr Griffiths promised a dynamic leadership for ASCC during his term . He has promised to lead ASCC through the next five years .
 In view of what we said, we wonder if Mr Griffiths is not being too optimistic in so far as what he thinks of the group he is to lead next year .
 It seems that much of the trouble with past and present councils is that they are largely comprised of jaded deadwood, students who ran for and gained office with an attitude based on ego .
 If Mr Griffiths hopes to put his policies into effect, it would seem to us that it would be wise if the incoming president reviewed the candidates for the different class positions .

 If this first step, that of warning the student, is taken, the individual may find, in some cases, that his suspicions have been allayed by. information acquired in the process, and that it is no longer feasible to report the case to the honor council .
 If the student does wish to report the case, he must contact a member of the council within two school weeks after the observation .
 This honor council member is responsible for submitting a written report to the entire council concerning the details of the case . The honor council is a member of the honor council .
 The student accused is notified of the accusation by a registered letter . If he thinks the accusation is not valid, he must notify the chairman or the secretary of the council within forty-eight hours of the notification . The accusation is automatically recorded as a formal warning .
 When an accusation is contested, a formal hearing of the council is held to determine whether or not it believes the accusation to be valid . A formal hearing will be held to decide if or not the accusation is valid .
 Accused and accuser appear individually before the council to present their testimonies . The accused and accuser are accused and accused of sexual assault .
 The honor council may call as many witnesses as they want . They, as well as the honor council, may call witnesses as many as they desire .
 The proceedings of this hearing are kept secret . The names of those involved in a case of discipline and the evidence in connection with it are never divulged by the members of the honor council .
 At least nine members of the council of 13 members must be present for the hearing . At least a majority vote of those present is necessary in order to issue a warning .
 The procedure for reporting a suspected second violation and the subsequent hearing are the same as that required for a first violation . A 9/13 vote of the council members is necessary to issue a second warning .
 In the event that a verdict of guilty is returned against the accused, the honor council recommends dismissal to the president of the college . The honor council also recommends dismissal of the accused .
 The council also recommends that if a person so dismissed requests a transcript of his college record to be forwarded to another institution that the administrative office take into consideration the L-ecommendations of the honor council .

 Once the PC is a moving concern the training program should be integrated with the regular college curriculum . Training program should also be integrated into the regular College curriculum .
 Standards for PC would be intensive study of languages, history, economics, and especially the culture of particular areas . PC would study languages, . history, . economics, . and especially . culture of . particular areas, . .
 If a student wants to go into the Peace Corps, he should take available education courses in instructional methods . The Peace Corps is a volunteer program that teaches people how to serve in the Peace Corp.
 From this training period through his term of office, the volunteer would be subject to immediate dismissal and a return trip home . The volunteer would have to return home .
 Those who don't adjust to new challenges must be relieved of their duties promptly . Those who do not adjust to a new challenge must adjust to it, he says .
 The Peace Corps will not be an exemption from the draft, but will in most cases be grounds for deferment . Peace Corps is not exempt from draft . It will be used as a way to get around the country .

 At the end of one's term a separation allowance will be given, depending on the length of the term . The separation allowance is given to one of the longest serving MPs .
 The critics of the PC have a fairly strong opposition rolling; it runs the line from GOP in Congress who desire a ""go slow"" attitude all the way to the abolition of the plan entirely .
 To the last group belongs Mr LeFevre, editor of the Colorado Springs GazetteTelegraph .
 In an editorial dated March 28, 1961, "Kennedy's Kiddie Kar Krew" implied that boys should not be sent to do a man's job . The editorial was published in March 1961 .
 Peace Corps, besides spending tax money, would again lower U.S. prestige . The Peace Corps would also lower American prestige, says President Obama .
 Mr LeFevre's reply seems fitting to critics of the Peace Corps . However, to the critics, it seems fitting .
 It seems a better idea to have this harbinger of world peace carried on by the youth than leave it in the hands of mature elders who appear once every so often on campus .
 Racial prejudices, rigid attack against Socialist-Pacifist speakers and a general mistrust of any form of intolerance for ideas which are called ""un-American"" are qualities which would immediately eliminate these people from the Peace Corps .
 If maturity is to be a deciding factor for membership on any Peace Corps-type program, it will be achieved by the training of eager and for the large part ""openminded"" youths, not dogmatic elders .

 Colorado College is aware that it operates under an Honor Code . We come to Colorado College aware of that . Colorado College operates under that code .
 The signature does not always indicate that we understand the workings of the system or more basically, the privileges of living and working in the context of being trusted . But that signature doesn't always indicate how much we understand or understand the system .
 Many of us never have been forced to work in a school where the guiding principle was that studen s are not honest . "Many of us ... never have worked in schools where we were not honest," she says .
 The consequences of this P.H.D. system are described as a "counter-terrorism system" in which the students are guilty ratal proven proven .
 Those who have been unfortunate enough to exist in this environment can appreciate the breath of the air that an honor code introduces . An honor code is a good thing for those unfortunate to be unfortunate to exist .
 An atmosphere of trust is essential for the best relationship between students and faculty, says professor . Students and faculty should be able to trust each other, he says . Students should also have a good relationship with faculty, he adds .
 The honor code permits the kind of enynyn onment that a liberal arts college seeks to achieve . But it does more for the individual, in giving him the full restart ion that he is not engaged in a game of trying to outwit his fellow students or faculty .
 This system makes each puson aware that he is responsible to himself for his ; own actum * It seems that his is far better than the other alternative-ot living constantly under the shadow of suspicion .
 "In order to maintain this atmosphere of trust, we must want the system to work. We must want it to work," she says .
 In order for the system to work, those who fail to live up to their trust must be made aware that they harm others as well . Those who harm others must be aware of their harm as well as those who harm themselves .
 Perhaps our greatest immediate responsibility is to ensure that those who sit on the Honor Council will be the best possible representatives .
 New members will be chosen on Tuesday by those we select from our classes . New members of our class will be announced on Tuesday .
 Those class delegates should be reminded that they have a serious job to do . The class delegates must be reminded of their duties .
 Those chosen to act on the governing body of the system have an even greater obligation . They must also have a greater obligation to act as a member of that body .
 They set the standard and have the power to enforce it in case of violations . They have the authority to enforce the standards .
 Recognition of that power and the responsibility it carries must serve to encourage them to give their energies to what may often be a thankless task . Recognition must serve as a good example of the power of the U.S.
 Only by the proper exercise of this authority will the students be well represented and the system itself survive . Only by this exercise, the students and the school itself survive, the system will survive .

 The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9 of 1945 were one thousand times more powerful than any other weapons ever used before . The bombs were the most powerful ever used in the atomic bomb attacks .
 A modern strategic bomber can carry a single hydrogen bomb having the destructive force of 20 million tons of TNT . The bomb is one thousand times as powerful as the Nagasaki bomb, and one million times more powerful than any weapon ever used before Hiroshima .
 With these nuclear explosions come temperatures of millions of degrees instead of thousands of thousands and a fantastic amount of deadly radiation . And with these nuclear blasts, there is a lot of death radiation .
 The blast would collapse a reinforced concrete building with 10 inch walls . The blast of the 10 megaton bomb would collapse the building . The bomb would be the largest in the world's history .
 From within 4 to 7 miles of the blast all buildings would receive heavy damage and a mortality rate of 30 per cent . Then from within four to seven miles the blast would be deadly . The blast would have a death rate of up to 30% .
 Outside of this area to 10 miles the damage of suburban homes might result from sweeping fires . The damage to suburban homes could be as much as 10 miles from this area .
 Third degree burns suffered at Hiroshima involved all exposed individuals within a mile and one half of the blast . All exposed individuals in the Hiroshima blast were exposed to third degree burns . The blast was the largest blast in the history of Hiroshima .
 Radioactive fallout is due to fission bombs which enables radiation to occur . Fission bombs are responsible for causing radioactivity to occur in nuclear weapons .

 Denial is to assume that if a third World War broke out that nuclear weapons wouldn't be used . Another form of denial is to think that if such a war broke out, nuclear weapons would be avoided .
 This is absurdâ our whole military policy is centered around the use of such weapons, says CNN.com's John Sutter . "This is absurd," he says .
for we no longer posses enough conventional weapons. We have no other alternative. For us, we have no choice but to use conventional weapons .

 Every population contains psychotic and neurotic and profoundly malicious people . It is only a matter of time before one of them assumes power over such weapons and fires one to destroy a city .
 Americans have nominal command of the weapons on our bases in foreign countries, but our soldiers are greatly outnumbered and' could not prevent a seizure . The homelanders could seize the weapons by the homelanders, the author says .

 The following letter was received by Mr Hairy Booth from last year's exchange student Bruno Attolmi .
 The TIGER is printing it because its message is pertinent to all CC students, and, in fact, all students anywhere in America . The message is important to all students in the U.S.
 "Only now I can look back and see this past year as a whole, as a past experience," she says . "I can now look back to the past year," she writes .
 "My experience has been partial and incomplete, limited in time and in space (only Leningrad and Moscow) but I like to think to have made the most of these days," says the author of the book . "My life in Russia has been very interesting, but it's
 The ASCC is a car with a perfect engine and no dri Vfc shaft; they both run beautifully but don't go anywhere . At this time the analogy was drawn b, tween the ASCC and a car without a dri VFC shaft .
 The ASCC has, in the past, been no attempt by the ASCC to express dent opinion . Th reason, it was said, that they don't go anywhere is that ther has been no effort to express .
 The people that you elected to represenen] hi""; you are, for the most part, enthusiastic and able, but it shotilj be pointed out that these people do not represent all interest, on the campus .
 If all interests are to fe represented by the ASCC, a good many of them will have to represent themselves . The means of representation are available to all students, says the author .
 AH ASCC meetings are open and all students are invited auj urged to attend these meetings . AHASCC meetings will be open and students are encouraged to attend them .

 This reporter was rather surprised to find that the hard-hitting journalistic hand of Mr Pearson belonged to a quite engaging gentleman with nothing but a twinkle in his eye . Mr Pearson is a very engaging gentleman .

 All organizations which have 'ceived blanks from the editors of student handbook are requested fill them out and return them to the Rastall Center Desk .

 Kastall Center has just finished its second year as part of the Colorado College community . The Colorado College campus is home to Colorado College students and faculty members .
 In its two years of existence, Kastall Center has firmly established itself as the ""Hub"" 'f the college's extra-curricular life . In its 2 years of existnc e, the center has established itself .
 Three points of the philosophy behind our college union should be made if we wish to consider the direction that Ras']j should be taking . The union should definitely be made, says the writer .
 Rastall must pro -;,im itself to be just a piece of the college's activities pie . First of all, he must pro-im .
 iiggtaif has become the geographeal and traffic hub of the campus . It might be expected to also bethe social and activity hub to be sure, f or the campus itself .
 Both Rastall and ASCC are beseiged by requests to do this or that for this . or that group . Now, however, both Rastalls and . ASCC have been asked to do so much more .
 It would be loped that Rastall could limit itself to helping these groups to themselves, not spoon ceding them a massive bureauratic program .
 A significant part of Rastall's id Activities role can be the coordinition of the cooperation of several [roups in sponsoring such extend1(1, special affairs such as Writers' willVorkshop' Week and Greenwich tillage Week .
 The second point to be made â ning Rastall's philosophy is ;hat it must keep pace with CC's icademic advancement and not be ntervailing drag on CC's luest .
 Every organzation on campus has an obligaion to add to the student's entire ducational development and effort, bringing to the students an appreiation of what he and others are loing in the classroom .
 Bridging the gap beween the various academic displines and cultures is the special sponsibility of CC's extracurricar activities . CC's Extracuricar activities are the special sponsors of the school .
 Rastall can aid in lis by sponsoring programs that fill give students, in sugar :oated form, a glimpse at what he artist and scientist are both .
 His field of interest is the USSR and its foreign policy, about which he spoke clearly and with much knowledge, he said .
 The thesis of the talk was that it is evident there is a new look in the way that the Soviets, or more particularly Khrushchev, wish to deal with what they call the western camp . The thesis was that there is an obvious new look at the way the Soviets wish to
 The change is most apparent by comparing the contemporary attitude with the policy which Stalin formulated . Stalin formulated a policy which is similar to that of the Soviet Union .
 Stalin outlined the 'old look' in foreign policy such that the world is divided into two camps, that of socialism and that of capitalism . Future would be determined by which camp defeated the other, Stalin said .
 Russia's job was to strengthen socialism (a synonym for communism) in Russia and then use it as a base to spread it by revolution to other countries . Russia's goal was to use socialism as a basis for revolution to spread socialism across the world .
 Russia would strengthen herself by increasing economically by emphasizing henvy industry rather than consumer goods and militarily . Russia would defeat the imperialistic world by playing upon its three inherent contradictions, its labor against its capitalists, the imperialist countries against their colonies .
 Khrushchev has ambitious ideas about socialism, already claiming that the socialistic world is ahead of the capitalistic world . The socialist world is already ahead of capitalistic, Khrushchchev says .
 This comparison is not made on grounds of production but he claims supremacy in this field too in a much shorter time than seems at all likely . This is not only because he is faster than anyone else in the field .
 He appears to .be placing much more importance on the strengthening of Russia and socialism than the weakening of capitalism .
 Russia has introduced light industry in Russia itself, and since the Commnuistic conquest of Red China, seems more aware of Communnist possibilities in Asia, Africa and even South America .
 The liberal arts school is truly the last fortress against the anonymous conformity of bigness . In this area, the college is truly a fortress against anonymous conformity .
 It should be Rastall's role to show that satisfaction and happiness can still be found according to the individual's own designs . One happy family often breeds nothing more than contented, unproductive cows .
 In the final analysis Rastall's most significant contribution to the liberal arts concept can be in breeding discontent, rather than in smothering with a barrage of group therapy activities, he says .

 This joint effort on the part of the two schools is designed as a double opportunity for students to gain individual attention as well as to bring attention to fine arts in Colorado .
 The graduating seniors should be closer to reaching these goals than the rest of us . Having been here for four years, they should be able to reach these goals, if they are valid .
 The college has achieved its goal of "helping its students acquire self-reliance without losing humility" However, one person felt that lie had perhaps lost some humility .
 The college has in no way ""guided them in the development of self-control and the habit of considerate conduct toward others"", because this was learned in the home or not learned at all . The college says it has no way of "guiding them" in developing self-
 The men interviewed felt that the atmosphere on campus promotes more aggression and self-assertion among the men students than it does consideration . The men said they felt the atmosphere promotes aggression more than consideration .
 The college has indeed ""prepared them for active and intelligent participation as citizens", says the college . This rightfully belongs among college's goals, says the author .
 In .most cases the college has not ""sought with them n knowledge of Cod and provided the occasion for worship"", and that it should not necessarily try to . do this . That in . most cases . has not . necessarily tried to do this, and that . that in

 This difference in the Communist line is further illustrated by the conflict of the Mao Tse-Tung, Red Chinese Communist leader, and Khrushchev .
 At a meeting last year held in Moscow a document was issued, which because of the many contradictions involved is thought to be meant as a sign of unity rather than reconciliation of views .
 Mao feels Khrushchev is being too cautious with his dealings of promoting socialism and discrediting and weakening the West . The fact remains that Mao feels . He feels .
 Mao still recognizes Russia, however, as the leader of the socialist camp . Mao recognizes Russia as the head of the communist party .
 Khrushchev has every intention of furthering socialism and fully expects it to succeed . The new look, then, is that he fully expects socialism to succeed in the Soviet Union . He said: 'Krushchev had every intention to further socialism'
 At the same time, he agreed with President Eisenhower that there would be no war, no internal interference and no threats as far as the opposition of the two camps is concerned .
 Khrushchev is not willing to push his relations with the West to nuclear war, but does want an economic and ideological struggle, which he is convinced he will win . The Soviet Union is convinced it will win in ideological struggle against the West .

 He illustrated by e\amples from history that reason has never played a dominant role in the activities of men. Furthermore, he illustrated by . e\ samples from . history that . reason has . never been a dominant . role in men's activities .
 Tins all has tended to make the commitment to reason and intellect less tenable . Tins have tended to be made less accessible to the public by their consumption .
 Benezet went on to examine various reactions to the dilema of man as a seemingly non-rational creature . The dilema was the question of whether man is rational or irrational .
 Some react by becoming dogmatic and authoritarian, he said . Others become super-rationalists, holding out for possibility of the possibility of pessimism in the ability to do anything .

 Certainly, man is not all rational, but neither is he irrational â that is senseless and completely without contol . That is senseless, but that is not irrational, and it is senseless .

 This article is written to acquaint the student with Coburn library . How to Use the Library: Coburn Library . Coburn is located at Coburn College in North Carolina .
 The answer is found in understanding that this library really belongs to Mr Coburn, the author of the book . Coburn's library is in the heart of the nation's history .

 After about twenty minutes of juggling microfilm cans she will return and begin to put the film in the projector . She juggles microfilm canisters around the room .

 When the librarian finally returns with the correct copy and inserts it into the projector, you turn to the want-ads and look them over for about fifteen seconds . The librarian eventually returns to the library with the right copy of the ads .
 Another method for amusing the librarian takes a bit more effort but I believe that you'll find the rewards make the project worthwhile .
 At this point you dash for the door leaving a trail of books in your wake . At the end of the book, you dash to the door and leave a trail behind .
 It is usually advisable to stay away from the library for a few days after this as the librarians are rather forceful when expressing their gratitude .
 You will rest securely with the knowledge that you have brought some excitement to an otherwise dull life. Of course, you will rest secure with the . knowledge that . you have . brought . some excitement .
 In conclusion, I want you to remember that the library is here for your use . I want to remind you that it's here for you to use . The library is free to use.

 A commentator on the college scene, writing; in the October HARPER'S MAGAZINE, made a couple of challenging observations in regard to religion on our campuses .
 "The standing assumption is that ultimate questions are in principle unanswerable, and hence not worth asking seriously,"" he contended . "It's a standing assumption," he said .
 These articles, we believe, indicate something of an active approach to the problems presented above . These articles indicate that something is being done to address the problems .
 The campus religious program, under the very able direction of Mr Kenneth Burton, is developing along two main lines . Campus religious program will focus on the development of students and adults .
 First, it is presenting to the non-Christian student a means of exploring Christianity and of determining its relevance and its values .
 "The assumption underlying this program is that ultimate questions are indeed important and meaningful," the program's creator says .
 If they are unanswerable, they nevertheless have great significance, and the religious program is attempting to give the student, be he Christian or not, a way to explore both the significance and some possible answers .
 Mr Burton lias made it very clear that the student's approach to ultimate questions is extremely important to the religious program . In relation to the second point quoted above, Mr Burton said that he made it clear that .
 Only through the expression of students' thinking can religion become meaningful and relevant in the context of the campus . Only through students' expression of religion can be meaningful, relevant in context of campus .
 We believe that there is among many students a real concern about the meaning and purpose of their lives and of life in general . We believe many students are concerned about their lives .

 Much talk at Colorado College of the non-existence of a social need to join a fraternity . Then' is much talk at . Colorado College . Then 'Then' Then'
 Sincere feeling, no doubt, is behind this talk; however, feeling will do hardly anything to face the problem, says CNN.com's John Defterios .
 The college is all too willing for the fraternities to take the responsibility of most social events . Fraternities are responsible for many of the college's social events, according to students .
 The most effective way for the college to show that we don't have to be ""Greek"" to have a social good time is for it to sponsor some social functions of its own . The college should sponsor its own social functions, the college says .
 The blame for the deplorable control fraternities have over this campus must not stop with the college administration . The blame is not only to blame the frat brothers, but also the university's administration .
 When college sponsors functions, independents should come out in droves . Independent voters should be encouraged to come out to support the college .
 The administration must sponsor more all-college functions, both formal and informal . 2.2.3.4.5.5 . The administration needs to sponsor more . all-College functions; 2.1.3 . The college must also sponsor more formal functions; 3.2

 There are forces working to prevent an accident and double checks would operate to limit the effects of one . For instance, the Soviet authorities know that the U-2 would not have come alone if an attack were intended .

 Eisenhower pointed out that one effect of tension is to evoke alertness to a challenge . Eisenhower said tension is a good thing for the nation to be alerted to the challenge .
 It would be well to recognize that the challenge is not likely to be soon removed from the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration .
 It remains even when not visible and can visibly be turned on overnight in the Kremlin . The Kremlin can be seen as a sign of life in Russia .
 Of course learning to live with any wrong condition involves the danger of too-easy acceptance of it . Of course ""learning to live"" with any right condition involves too easy accepting it .
 But it will be best prosecuted in an atmosphere free from self-induced panic . The case will be prosecuted in a free atmosphere free of self-imposed panic .

 Freshman Commissioner Sue Caudill said she had heard some complaints that such meetings are dull . She said ASCC does nothing but fill the traditional requirement that there be a student government .
 Perhaps, then, it would be wise for us to explore the current operations of ASCC more closely, perhaps . Perhaps, perhaps, we should look at ASCC's operations closely .
 President Griffiths has expressed his goals frequently, both before and after his election . Griffiths says he is committed to achieving his goals in the future .
 ASCC should be modified to allow future ASCC members to continue such execution without confusion . ASCC's mechanical functions should be executed competently and efficiently . The organization itself should also be modified so that future members may continue such executions without confusion, he says .
 ASCC should deal with substantive issues concerning the student's position on CC's campus . ASCC must also deal with the student position on the campus of CC .
 ASCC can push, on a sound basis, for meaningful, progressive policy changes . If it is, it will push for meaningful policy changes, ASCC says . ASCC is in a position to push for progressive policies .
 President Griffiths is taking a lead from far more important deliberative bodies, he says . Committees can most effectively handle the details, and deliberations about details, of student government .
 The ASCC's Monday meetings are able to deal with fifteen or more areas of student government swiftly and finally . The result is that the meetings can be completed quickly and efficiently . ASCC meetings can also deal with student government issues .
 If these meetings seem dull, then that is the price of effective student government, says student leader . Students should be aware of what is involved in the business conducted, he says .
 The progress of ASCC toward the goals mentioned above has been encouraging, but much, certainly remains to be done . ASCC's progress in the community is encouraging .
 The Constitution Committee has already produced needed amendments to the constitution, and more are forthcoming . Commissioner Bill Greeley has led the hard-working leadership of the committee .
 The Judicial Committee, ably chaired by Bob Kendall, is currently conducting an exhaustive study into the workings and scope of our student judicial bodies .
 The finance committee, chaired by Treasurer Bill Stafford, has studied money requests thoroughly and proposed the budget . The budget will appear in the TIGER today .
 Many other examples could be mentioned here, but it is our hope that they will, by their actions, speak through the news columns of this paper .
 We do not hold that the measure of student government is the length or heatedness of its meetings, the intensity of the publicized controversy among its members or the number of headlines it or its members get for attacks on the school administration . We don't hold that .
 We look rather for its sound and enduring accomplishments, for its hard and honest effort and for the quality of its work, we say . We look forward to the future of the U.S. government .
 ASCC currently compares very favorably with other student governments with which we are familiar with . ASCC is currently ranked higher than any other student government in the world .
 If our student government can continue to set forth accomplishments of quality and lasting value, we shall be content that ASCC has a great deal more meaning than simply the manifestations of a useless tradition . ASCC will be content if it continues to set out accomplishments that have lasting value .
 We recommend to ASCC's critics that they attend its meetings and the meetings of its committees, that they set forth their own ideas . The council has failed to meet its purposes or has wrongly interpreted the issues at hand, we say .
 Criticism of this kind cannot help but make student government more than a bothersome custom . When It's Music It's Millers Miller Music Co. Co.

 He has already contacted several dorms and Greek organizations . Some might be hurt, for in the past we have seen so little protyjj displayed .

 In the past week, the reader has undoubtedly seen greater tributes to the deceased ""Mr Sam"" than we can pen . Mr McCormack's funeral will be attended by his family and friends .
 We feel compelled to add our voice to those of eulogy, and also to look for a moment beyond the fact of Sam Rayburn's death to the state of congressional government . We are compelled to look beyond that fact of his death to state of Congress .
 He served in the House of Representatives from that day until one day a few months ago . He served as a member of Congress from that time to one day ago .
 For one third of his 48 years on Capitol Hill, he served as Speaker of the House . He served as a Democrat for more than 48 years .
 His steady hand guided the House from the New Deal through world war, through the Fair Deal, through McCarthyism, through Modern Republicanism and through Cold War to the New Frontier .
 His guidance was consistent in fairness and firmness, in integrity and respect, in political realism and foresighted statesmanship, he says . He says .
 Sam Rayburn held the respect of four presidents, untold congressmen, and countless Americans in public and private life . Rayburn was the second most powerful man in the land .
 We can add little to the eloquent tributes paid Mr Sam by these people . Mr Sam's funeral will be held in New York City, New York .
 The U.S. has lost one of its greatest incarnations of the ideals of representative government . Yet we do want to say that the United States has lost a great thing .
 We wonder if this statement does not also point up the seriousness of Mr Sam's passing . But we wonder if it does also point to the serious seriousness of his passing .
 "It was unifying a body of individuals who are in a large sense independent of the President, the Speaker, and one another," he said .
 It was using the full force of a great and respected personality, of political compromise and fairness, to meet the crushing demands of world tension and mass society â demands magnified .
 There are many congressmen, unknown outside their districts except to the closest observers, who work and work very hard, year after year, to promote the ideals represented by Rayburn .
 Any one of them could rise to the occasion, and could build quickly, given the pressure of time, build quickly the respect and prestige which served Rayburn as a powerful tool time after time .
 Most likely successor to Rayburn, John McCormack of Massachusetts, is not, in our opinion, one of these men . McCormack is not likely to succeed Rayburn .
 He does not now command sufficient respect among his own party members . Many are dissatisfied with his majority leadership, many are unhappy with him .
 McCormaek's open and publicized break with the President over school aid makes him an unlikely successor to the tradition of conciliation left by Mr Sam . McCormaeks' break with President Obama makes him a likely successor to Mr Sam.
 There is little evidence that Mr McCormack has or can exercise the far-ranging and far-sighted political judgment which characterized Rayburn . McCormack is not likely to exercise the same judgment as Rayburn, writes Andrew Hammond .
 Many of his less-known colleagues, on the other hand, could exercise such judgment . Many of these colleagues could exercise their judgment, too .
 McCormack took the Speaker's chair in the closing weeks of the last session of Congress . McCormack was Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s .
 We believe that the House, in the best interests of itself as an institution and of the nation as a whole, must replace Mr Sam with a man who, if not like him, can at least serve as well .
 Our readers who agree would do well to write their own Congressmen of their concern .
 We wish to help, in what ever way possible, to make representative government a continuing, worthwhile and vital part of our society .
 As a full-time student and a participant in the basic ROTC program, I feel compelled to reply to Mr Trushel's article (""Comment"") in the Tiger .
 Two years ago, faculty voted two to one against compulsory ROTC . Trushel says decision was based on 'mere whim or flight of fancy'
 In regard to this vote (which had no effect on the administration) the following actions were taken by the ROTC department . The vote did not affect the administration, but the actions of the department were taken .
 Trushel's assessment of the value of the ROTC's The Red Menace at Home and Abroad and The Care and Feeding of Your M-lays is worth 2 extra hours .
 I feel that Mr Trushel forgets that his friend is being a ""tine leader"" in an entirely imposed and unnatural circumstance and that he, as a cadet, is obeying out of a fear of punishment .
 Mr Trushel's belief that the ability to observe dirty brass and to say ""two demerits"" is ""True leadership" is what he might call the man who leads others to safety .
 Mr Trushel next tells us that ""the most common gripe"" is that ROTC is compulsory .
 Jesus told a parable about a businessman who embezzled funds belonging to his employer in order to insure that he himself would be provided for after his dismissal . Jesus told the parable of a man who was about to be dismissed for incompetence . Jesus said that a businessman embe
 Jesus praised the businessman and said he had shown himself to be wiser than many of the faithful . And Jesus, according to the original form of the account, praised him for his wisdom .
 This is the kind of statement we'd expect to hear from a cynic, not from Jesus . Jesus' comments come from the mouth of a cynical cynic . This is not the first time Jesus has made such a statement in his life .
 This parable doesn't run counter to Jesus' message as we know it elsewhere in the New Testament, but rather has a lot to say to all men, particularly those who are realistic enough to be aware that their own hands are not entirely clean . tp^EM^Qt

 This past weekend, we had the good fortune to attend a retreat at Camp La Foret . The retreat was held at the base of the retreat .
 "It was a very worthwhile and stimulating affair," says Burton . Burton's visit was part of a new religious program .
 Such programs are valuable additions to CC's already good assortment of extra-curricular programs . CC is a good place for students to take part in extra curricular activities .
 One of the real advantages to be found among these is that a student may choose to take in or to participate in those which have special interest or meaning to him .
 Of course, the pressures of time and conflicts in scheduling often limit a student's involvement in these activities .
 We wonder if most students are aware of the advantages to be found in these organized activities . Yet we wonder if they are not aware of these advantages .
 Even when conflicts of time and scheduling are recognized, we still find that attendance at many such programs is poor . Attendance at such programs, such as retreats, coffee hours and assemblies, is poor.
 The purpose of the college is education, and the student's first obligation is to his studies . Perhaps we are being unfair, many will say, in that the purpose is education .
 We might retract the words of the preceding paragraph but for two considerations . We may retract the entire article . The author of this article retracts the words .
 First, we're not convinced that most students spend most of their waking hours studying . We're not sure that most of them are students, but we're glad they're studying .
 Students are faced with apportioning considerable amounts of non-study time to other activities . What generally happens is that the student is faced with . apportioned . amounts of time to study is not enough time .
 No time is allotted to these organized extracurricular activities simply because the student is not aware of them or of the value they hold . Very often, no time is given to these activities because of their importance .
 Many of these organized activities, from Mountain Club to International Relations Club, serve an educational purpose . Secondly, many of these organizations, such as Mountain Club, also serve a purpose .
 One might learn about useful physical activity, about faraway lands, about railroad research, about political organization on the precinct level .
 We shall try to continually remind our readers of the many activities taking place on our campus and of their advantages â educational, recreational, practical, practical or social, or what have you .

 The subject of women's dorm hours was considered in last week's ""Comment"" column in preparation for a questionnaire received this week by the women dorm residents .
 The article misrepresented, to some extent, the ideas behind this questionnaire and its immediate purpose . The article was misrepresented by some extent .
 The Hours Committee is investigating the problem of women's hours . The present system seems faulty and is constantly being contested, at least verbally, says the committee .
 It is felt that while the present hours are necessary for freshmen, sophomores, and probably juniors, a senior woman is practically ready to go ""on her own"" and be considered responsible for all her actions .
 As a senior she is still restricted seems a poor preparation for the life after college . The fact that as a senior . as a . senior she . still . still seems to be a poor prepare for the . life after . college .
 The Hours Committee feels that one of the primary purposes of a liberal arts college is to help the student's ability to adjust and carry the responsibility for his studies now, as well as for later life .
 The idea of an honor dorm for senior women is one way of bringing responsibility back to the student . The honor dorm is meant to be a safe haven for women in order to be responsible for their education .
 Each girl would have her own key and would be responsible only to herself . Sign out would still be required for purposes of safety, but signing out is still required .
 Those senior women not interested in the honor dorm would live with underclass women . Underclass women would abide by the existing hours . Senior women would live in honor dorms with younger women .
 A letter will be sent to the parents of this year's junior and senior women to find out their feelings on the subject . If the results of last week's questionnaire seem favorable towards the idea of a senior women's honor dorm, a letter will also be sent .

 Rastall Center aims to solve boredom problem by bringing more activities . Boredomites are hit hard with 'social drinking' when they arrive at the university .
 Drinking livens up a party, but often today it becomes a compulsive social drive . Drinking is still a social drive, but it can become a compulsion, says author .
 As they can no longer be held in the city parks, the danger of having to drive long distances is a serious one . The danger of driving long distances from the city is also a serious problem .
 Boyce suggested that we ""rent' the parks from the city as the city officials would probably welcome the money as long as our functions are scheduled events with planned agendas . Boyce suggests that we rent the city's parks from a fee of $1,000 .

 "Some of these activities are much more valuable than others," says CNN.com . "We believe, at the outset, that some of the activities are very valuable."
 We would argue that a student benefits more from these activities by allotting his time well, and from devoting his extra-curricular efforts to a few substantive activities . Moreover, a student would benefit more from allotting time well by devoting time well .
 One student might believe that certain activities have such value, another not . One student, however, may believe that such activities have value .
 In any case, the point is simply that a value judgment is involved in selecting activities, and a student ought to make that judgment with some thought .
 A second facet of this value judgment is that of the time involved, the author says . The time involved is the time it takes to make a decision .
 We would contend that students suffer in either of two ways by misusing the time they set aside for extra-curricular activities . Students suffer either way of misusing time set aside to take part in extra curricular activities .
 They either give time to so many activities that they can participate fully or effectively in none, or they can get so involved in a single activity that they deprive themselves of any of the benefits of other activities .
 Our extra-curricular activities are an important part of our college experience . We are proud of our students' efforts to participate in extra curricular activities .
 In this class students would be expected to complete a full length book, poetry collection, or any of the other modes of creative writing .
 The only part of the work that would be done in the classroom would be that which the student desired to do; i.e., if a student should have some general or specific writing problem, we would be free to consult his professor at certain specified times; . In fact, the
 At the end of the first semester, the student would turn in his completed work for criticism . If this course was intended to run two semesters, the students working on shorter problems would revise their work . Those working on novels, or other extended assignments would spend the second semester finishing and
 The student enrolled in this course should be allowed complete freedom of choice in his selection of the type of writing he desired to do . However, an attempt should be made to limit the choice to include creative writing at which the professor was particularly proficient in explaining .
 The truly creative student does not need the enticement of credit and possible publication of his work to write . Students should not be enticed into writing, they say .
 Many students would take a course in creative writing feeling it would be a ""snap course,"" and would be in over their heads . Students would take the creative writing course in fear they would be over-over-run .
 It is true that many people are creative without added incentives, but it should not be necessary for a student to sacrifice time that could be used for a credit course in order to write .
 A creative writing class would make it possible for many students to discover talent they were not aware of, or develop a writing hobby into a writing career . Also, a creative writing course would help students discover talent and develop a career .

 We would rather like to pose some serious questions to those who pause to read these columns . We ask: What do you think of the world's most powerful people?
 The real meaning of Christmas lies far deeper than just the event of Jesus' birth . The real Christmas is not just the birth of Jesus, it's the meaning of the Christmas Day itself .
 It lies in the panorama of human experience â joy, sadness, tragedy, tragedy and despair, despair, bitterness, and hope â through which Christ moved in the thirty-three years following the first Christmas . Christ moved through this panorama, through which he moved through the years following
 Christ and Christmas are meaningless unless the reality of human experience and the well-spring of hope, both inseparable part of the life, death, and rising of Jesus, are taken into account . Jesus' life and death are inseparable parts of his life, his death and his rise
 We suggest that the 'Christmas Spirit,' to the Christian, should not be manifested in a diversionary or abstract joy, but in reflection upon the whole meaning of Christ's coming .
 It should be rooted in the quiet hope of Bethlehem's winter night and of a certain dawn, some thirty-three years later, when three mourning women came to an empty tomb .
 Even if one doesn't accept the theology of Jesus' coming, he can still find, in the life and death of the carpenter from Galilee, much to ponder . The carpenter's life and the death of Jesus is a life of a carpenter .
 For that life and that death were not abstracted fairy-tale style to take place somewhere in the clouds, they were for that life . For that, for that, they would not have been abstracted .
 Jesus lived among men and shared their common experiences, dealing with them as a man . Jesus lived with men and dealt with them in a unique way of living with them .
 We might suggest to Christians and non-Christians alike that they explore the ""Christmas Spirit"" among men to see if there is within it some good, some enduring quality which offers hope .
 We seek only to pose questions here, not answers, in the hope that those who ponder these questions may find real meaning in this Christmas season . We seek to ask questions not answers but to seek real meaning .

 Sophocles' Tragedy Chosen As CC's First ""Guinea Pig"" by James H Fox . The rise and fall of the proud, dynamic heir to the curse on the House of Labdacus .
 Sohpocles is a simple production of Purcell's opera, but simplicity of production is the rule . The opera is set in a simple setting, with no extras and costumes .
 The backdrop sacrificed taste on the altar of artiness . The backdrop's glaring symbolism sacrificed taste for artiness.
 William Hochman almost redeemed his failure to fully express the title role's driving curiosity and enormous compassion and vanity . The film is set in New York, New York .
 He received a respectful applause from his fellow actors and the audience for creating an Oedipus of stature and intelligence .
 At least half of the chorus didn't understand what they were saying, nor that they were on stage during their periods of silence . I have mixed feelings about the chorus, including some who were not on stage .
 Donald Jenkins, dividing his voices into tenors and baritones, occasionally achieved striking effects, particularly in Ode II, "Let us all be reverent in the ways of right,"" before the entrance of the Corinthian Messenger. the production's impressi' climax.
 Roberts pushed his blocking dangerously close to overacting, but his energy and control kept the audience engrossed .
 In the bitter, ironic scene between Oedipus and Tiresias, Paul Barnard's blind prophet, powerful in vision, was delightfully human in fear, anger, and finally pity for the doomed ruler .
 John Lewis was only superficially Creon, a simple, direct, basically good man, who has no desire for the responsibilities of power . Although sufficiently logical and conservative, he was sufficiently conservative and conservative .
 She possessed the voice and appearance, but lacked sensitivity, as did the wooden, weak.gestured Priest, who almost suffocated the play's kick-off, and the nervous, flippant Palace Messenger .
 Kenneth Burton, as Choragus, for beautifully expressing devotion and some understanding of the protagonist's suffering . Laurels go to Kenneth Burton for beautifully, simply expressing devotion .

 Tocos & Pizza CC Greek Production Rated As ""Admirable"" Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week, CC witnessed a production of Sophocles' tragedy Oedipus Rex .
 Sophocles' powerful presentation of the workings of fate . Those who concentrated on the lines, the essence of the Greek drama, could not miss the play .
 The modern audience is oriented to the reality of action, not long dialogue, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 The audience tended to become inattentive and thus lose much of the play's significance in spite of the good articulating of both actors and chorus . Therefore, especially during the choric odes, the audience tends to become distracted during the play .
 The translation itself was generally inferior and even ludicrous at times in its attempt to modernize the script . The play as a whole weakened the play as well as the translation itself . Also the fact that the translated itself was . generally inferior .
 Another factor which weakened this production was the cluttered appearance of the stage . The production was also criticised for being too cluttered .
 The general set design and lighting were very good, but there were too many people on the stage for its size . The set design was very good but there was too much room for the stage .
 Most easily dispensed with would have been the suppliants, whose floating and hovering about was very distracting and added nothing but confusion and clutter . Most easily . dispensed . from would have had to be removed from the scene .
 Dr. Hochman made a tragically imposing Oedipus (although he seemed .much older than his mother) The film was directed by Gene Seymour Seymour, who directed it in New York .
 Bernard was convincing at Tiresias the blind prophet; and Reverend Burton made a forceful Choragus . Reverend Burton also played a forceful role in the play . St. Bernard made a convincing performance at Tireias .
 The weakest character appeared at the end in the person of Dr. Dr. Martin . Unfortunately, the weakest character in the film was Dr. Jan .
 His FlashGordon appearance and excited delivery detracted from the double tragedy of Jocasta's death and Oedipus' selfbinding .
 The productio was a success, for it had the power to move those who understood it and appreciated it for what it was . Nevertheless, the productio a success .

 The columns of the TIGER were responsible for awakening again the belabored, and at that time dormant, issue of ROTC on CC's campus . The columns were responsible .
 In the first place, an issue of this sort, in a community such as this with a very rapid turnover in its population, is never settled . In the second place, the issue is never finally settled, says the mayor .
 The issue must, it seems, be reassessed by eveiy passing college ""generation,"" and this is probably a good thing . The issue will be re-evaluated by the passing college "generation"
 A new insight has come out of columns, letters to the editor, student comments, and student comments which have appeared in these pages recently . But more importantly, a new insight, or perhaps a new emphasis, has come from the columns and letters .
 The realization has emerged that the question of ROTC is related to the larger questions which face our society . The realization of the question has emerged is that it is related .
 The United States is today faced with the necessity of maintaining a massive military establishment . The U.S. faces the need to maintain a military presence .
 Throughout history, the existence of such a military establishment has proven itself incompatible with constitutional democracy . The presence of such an armed military establishment is incompatible with democracy, it has said .
 Standing armies have always been kept at a size less than military thinking would term adequate . Those who developed our government in the U.S. have long recognized this to be true, he says .
 The mainstay of our defenses has been the reserves â the citizen-soldiers . The nation's defense has been in the hands of its citizens, the president says .
 The purpose of the ROTC program is to train officers for these reserves . The purpose is to prepare officers for the reserves .
 It's not aimed at shaping career officers, but rather at training men who can, after college, take time out from their civilian pursuits to help maintain our defense system .
 The alternative to reserve officers, trained in an arts and sciences background, is the leadership of all our armed forces by academy-trained, professional soldiers . Academy-trained soldiers should be trained in arts and science backgrounds .
 One need only look at the present situation in France, among others, to see how dangerous this can be to constitutional democracy . The situation is particularly dangerous for constitutional democracy, writes Andrew Hammond .
 College-trained citizenofficers over against a professional, elite officer corps, we see little choice . Given these two alternatives, college-trained citizens over against elite officers, it's little choice.
 The Department of the Army would not, under present regulations, maintain the ROTC program on our campus unless a certain number of students were guaranteed for the program . The program would not be maintained under regulations, according to the Army .
 The only way, at present, is to meet that guarantee is to make basic ROTC compulsory . It is not the only way to meet this guarantee .
 If ROTC continues on a compulsory basis, male students will be deprived of their ""academic freedom" to some degree, and they will be subjected to some unpleasantness, says Simon Tisdall .
 If the program is discontinued, those who want to serve as reserve officers will be deprived of their means to do so . The Army will lose a source of well-and liberally-educated officers .
 This kind of program is disturbing to most students at an institution where freedom is supposed to be maximized and distracting unpleasantness minimized . Students at the University of Columbia University say it's disturbing .
 The ROTC program has more value than the charges against it can overbalance, says the U.S. Army .
 This is not to say that there are not severe shortcomings in the ROTC program . The program has been criticized for its lack of oversight by the Army .
 We will soon offer some constructive criticisms and suggestions . We believe there are there are, and we hope there will be constructive criticisms .

 Colorado Spri ROTC â II: "We expressed the belief that the basic principles of the program and the alternatives to maintaining that program dictate that we continue it here at Colorado College" i Mnnamr.
 We believe that although compulsory ROTC may infringe on a student's academic freedom, it is not inconsistent with the classical concept of liberal education . We believe . that, although compulsory . ROTc may infringue on student's . academic freedom .
 In fact, this classical concept of liberal arts may often stand in conflict with a student's freedom of choice . The concept of a broad education may often conflict with students' freedom to choose . Students should be able to choose their own education, not just a liberal arts .
 It should strive to clear up misunderstandings which plague it and win the respect necessary for its proper and continued performance . Course material in ROTC classes should be carefully organized to better orient the student, to more adequately deal with the relation of the citizen to the military .
 We realize that these are general, unrevolutionary, and for the most part unintriguing comments, but we hope that they will cause some serious thought on the part of the college community and some serious re-evaluation .
 We see no reason why, given the opportunity, the ROTC program cannot evolve as a means for broadening the liberal base of a liberal education . The program provides future citizens with an insight into a military system over which they must retain ultimate control, we say .

 Mr Kudoff and Mr Bodrman feel that CD is necessary as a deterrent force for avoiding nuclear war . CD is needed to avoid nuclear war, they say .
 Mr Van Becker feels that we should be spending the money we spend on CD for peace . The project of increasing our CD would make us familiar with warw ords and thoughts which could tend to make us become machines .
 Mr Bailey would like to go a step further and have unilateral disarmament . He wants to go further and disarm disarmament, he says .
 Mr Wright, serving as the moderator, kept the discussion within grasp of the audience's comprehension .
 I am not trying to contain the thoughts presented at the meeting in one paragraph, but I want to illustrate the diversity of opinion that was shown . I am also trying to show that there is a diversity of opinions from the meeting .
 I was disappointed that more students are not interested enough in their future to listen to a discussion of something that is affecting the budget of the nation, is playing a part in our relations with Russia and could possibly be vital to them in the event of war .
 Perhaps they know so much about CD that this kind of discussion would only waste their time . I wish this were the case, but I doubt that it is. Perhaps this is the case. I doubt it is .
 Commitment should be thanked for sponsoring such a discussion . In the second place, I think that Commitment . should be thank for sponsoring the discussion. In the first place, we should thank Commitment for sponsoring this discussion .
 I think many of us on campus have gotten the wrong idea about them. I am not a member of that group, but I would like to say that I think we should be careful of them . I'm not a part of the group. I'm glad that we're not.
 Commitment, as I see it, is actually a group of students interested in the intellectual activity of thinking . Commitment is actually an idea that students are interested in intellectual activity, he says .
 Their purpose is to promote activities which lead the participants into making a personal commitment to a specific side of a question . It doesn't matter what side as long as one reaches a definite conclusion based on rational endeavors .

 Commitment Panel Debates United States Civil Defense Needs . Panel discussed morality and practicality of civil defense . Panel of five Colorado College professors debated the morality of the law .
 The discussion, sponsored by Commitment, was held in the WES room of Rastall Center . It drew a considerable number of people interested in this timely dilemma of whether the current emphasis (not to mention expense) on civil defense is an aid or detriment to national security .
 Commitment presents all factors concerning the*current national crises to those who will listen . Commitment aims to present all factors in the hope that better informed, they may be able to make intelligent decisions .
 The panel presented both sides of the Civil Defense question . The panel was evenly divided, pro and con .
 Dr. Wilbur Wright, professor of physics, serving as moderator, opened the discussion by stating that the theme was to be the morality and practicality of Civil Defense . He then turned the matter to Dr. Wright .
 In a nuclear war, the effectiveness of a shelter would be extremely limited . The effectiveness of the shelter in a war would be very limited .
 The money spent negatively on shelter should instead be used positively as aid for the helpless . The money should be spent on shelter instead of sheltering the homeless .
 Civil Defense and arms stockpiling are necessary to show our enemies that we are prepared and that their attack would bring only retaliation . The U.S. should be prepared to face an attack on its enemies .
 "We must show our allies that we are prepared to defend the freedom which we extol," says President Barack Obama .
 Money spent for CD diminishes the probability of attack and so is spent positively . Th money spent on CD reduces the likelihood of attack .
 Dr. David Van Becker, professor of English and Commitment's other unofficial advisor, sided with Dr. Van Becker . Mr Van Becker is a professor at the university .
 Bomb shelters, not fallout shelters, are necessary to survive a nuclear blast, experts say . Bomb shelters are necessary for survival in a nuclear bomb blast, they say .
 Radiation will continue to be dangerous for a month or longer . The recommended two-week food supply is insufficient, as radiation will continue for a longer period . Radiation is still dangerous in the area .
 It is impossible, either humanly or economically, to launch an adequate Civil Defense program as it would take an estimated ten years and a tripled national budget to launch .
 Living in shelters will reduce man to a survival machine in a de-humanized world, says John Sutter . Sutter: "Living in shelters reduces man to be reduced to a surviving machine"
 The fact that we assume war to be inevitable greatly increases its probability greatly increases the likelihood of war . We assume war is inevitable, but we also assume it is inevitable that it will be inevitable .
 Civil Defense is a program for national defense and unless it is taken, no one will be saved . Civil Defense programs are a national defense program . Civil defense is a national security program .
 We should save as many people as possible to carry on the purpose of those who died. We should be able to carry out the purpose that those died. It's a good idea to save as much as possible, he says .
 Wright reiterated the dangers of the number's game, making the point that there are so many indeterminate factors in an offensive attack (i.e., weather, detection, aim) that it is next to impossible to make any kind of a reliable estimate of possible destruction .
 An attempt at survival, even at the expense of dehumanization, is better than total destruction of the human race . An attempt to survive, even if it's better than the destruction of human race, is a good thing for the world .

 Donald Shearn, assistant professor of psychology, is trying to determine how enviroment â such as the morning alarm clock, the sun's glare, or soft music â produces changes by recording variations in the electrical resistance of the skin .
 Professor Shearn conducts the program on a $2,000 grant from the U.S. Health, Education and Welfare Department's Public Health Service .
 The first phase of the research probably will be completed by midsummer . He said the first phase will probably be complete by mid-June .
 Electrodes are attached to the surface of the volunteer subject's skin to pick up' the electrical changes . Electrodes were attached to . the skin to monitor electrical changes in the skin .
 The electrodes lead to a meter which measures the amount of electricity passing through the skin . The electrodes are electrodes which lead to an electricity meter .
 During one experiment, the subject will listen to nervous system to activate the a noise . The subject will also listen to a noise that activates the nervous system .
 This may cause the central sweat glands, which in turn cause a marked reading on the meter . This may also cause the body temperature to rise .
 If this experiment is repeated often enough, the skin may become conditioned to change its resistance rapidly to stop an unpleasant noise . The skin may be conditioned to become conditioned by the noise .
 Shearn said he is attempting to control reactions by making certain events, such as sounds, occur as a consequence of, or as a reward for these changes in the nervous system . Shearn says he is trying to control reaction by making sounds occur as consequence of or as reward .

 Year in and .year out it has .been the honor system that has . placed the school in its distinguished position in American education . Year in . and year out it . has . been the honor . system .
 It is the honor system that has made possible much of the characteristic life of the college community . The honor system is a model of community life at the University of Cambridge .
 It is the honor system that has helped create an environment in which serious intellectual pursuits are possible and in which excellence is respected . The honor system has helped to create a serious intellectual pursuit in the U.S.
 It is the honor system that attracts more praise and more interest, among students and educators from New England to California, than anything else can be mentioned about the College .
 Our genuinely effective honor system is the one thing that is shared by only a handful of institutions in the nation . This is so because of all we can boast here, the nation can boast of all that it can boast .
 "We do not sufficiently appreciate the true importance of the honor system," he says . And yet in recent years he has increasingly sensed that we do not fully appreciate the importance of honor system .
 We are prone to regard it with complacency, to accept it as the natural course of things, to consider it as something else here that is old and traditional . We should be careful not to regard the situation as something that is traditional, says David Cameron .
 Too many of us are either unaware or forgetful of what exists were there no honor system . Too many people are unaware of or forget what exists .
 It can create an atmosphere of mutual hostility between faculty and students, and it can demoralize everyone by establishing a mood of cynicism and futility . It can sap the vitality of an institution, it can make the whole educational process, and create a sense of hostility between staff and students .
 Former students have developed, administered, supported, supported and maintained the honor system as a vital force on this campus . "Whatever may have been the inadequacies of our former students, they have at least made one great contribution that is the bedrock of everything else"
 If the present and future students wish to make a contribution, they can make no more significant one than continuing the same tradition . If you want to make an important contribution, you can continue the tradition of the school .
 It is not theirs alone; it belongs to every student who through the years has faithfully helped establish it as an integral part of our lives . It's not their alone, it's not the students alone; they have faithfully established it .
 The enjoyment of it is not simply a right and a privilege, but a solemn responsibility . For this reason, the enjoyment of this experience is not just a right but a serious responsibility . Enjoying the experience is a "privilege"
 The honor system is not ours to do with as we please; it is only ours to preserve . As Ruskin said of the architecture of the past, the honor system was not ours . It is only our to preserve.

 Two closely-related items of particular note to every student of CC as he or she begins this new semester . Elsewhere in the TIGER will be found .
 One is an announcement of sently exists, a violation of CC's Honor System during the recent examination period . The other is a breach of the Honor System . The Honor System is designed to ensure the integrity of the system .
 Colorado College's Honor Council was asked to be included in this week's TIGER at the request of the Honor Council . The Honor Council is concerned with the honor system, but not Colorado College .
 It appears that as the semester passes, some of CC's students, particularly upperclassmen, forget we are operating under a voluntary system of student discipline and self-discipline .
 This system has been in effect at CC since 1948 as an example of student self-government, and an admission of the trust our administrators, faculty, and even our predecessors have in us . This system is in effect as part of a model for self-governability at the University of

 This sermon originated while the preacher was reading a set book for the college ""Freedom and Authority"" course . The sermon originated from the preacher's reading of the book for a college course .
 So many mistaken statements were made in the book concerning the great reformers' teaching on the doctrine of election and predestination that the reader felt he had to look at their writings and that of the Bible again .
 The purpose of the sermon is to look briefly at something of what the .bible says concerning this subject . The sermon is a brief look at the Bible's teachings on this topic .
 This hopes to show that it is not such a forbidding and awful topic that people who have never properly read the reformers assert, and that the freedom of the will of man does have its place .

 Colorado College has lost twenty-four straight games and is in the cellar in its league . The team is currently in the bottom of its league and has lost 24 straight games . There is something chronically wrong with the hockey program here at Colorado College .
 Resolving this problem to simplest form it becomes one of letting the opposition score more goals than we ourselves score . The question is then what are the factors that are contributing to this dilution .
 This at first might seem that I was stating the obvious and was over simplifying the problem, but upon closer examination such is not the case. This at least might seem to be an over simplification of the problem . The problem is not a problem, however, it is a problem
 With very few exceptions, our team this year has been able to score at least three goals against the competitors, thus conclusively proving that our team has the fundamental scoring ability . This year's team has scored at least 3 goals against any of the competitors .
 At the same time, the opposition has without exception been able to score more goals, thus demonstrating that our basic weakness in competition is our defense . The opposition have scored more goals without exception to scoring more .
 Time and again, in the home games this season (and presumably on the road trips too) the defense has not covered ""the man in front of the net"" and this opposing player has scored, not just once, but several times in the course of the usual evening .
 It is virtually, impossible for any goalie to stop a well placed shot from close in like this . The fantastic number of goals scored against us this year are deceptive of the ability of the goalies for this very reason .
 No matter how talented a goalie might be, he is only as good as the defense in front of him . Goalkeeper is a liability for goalies in the NHL .
 The second consistent error on the part of our defense is that eveyone tries to be a goal tender with devas . The WHICKERBILL is a Gift and Card Shop with a bamboo cricket good luck symbol of the wortd .

 If we were to prevent the opposition from getting their shots off instead of blocking their shots, our defensive efforts would be much more effective . If the opposition cannot shoot, they cannot score, the defensive effort would be more effective for very obviously .
 Minnesota's defense was very ably demonstrated by the Minnesota defense last weekend . The Vikings defense is the perfect way to defend the NFL's top players .
 The third and last habitually obvious defensive mistake is the persistant obsession of going after the man instead of the puck . Go after the puck is the most obvious mistake in the NHL .
 So many times the CC team has ""checked"" the opposition, much to the pleasure of the crowd but failed to gain possession of the puck . The CC team have won't be able to find the puck in the game .
 Throughout the season, they have lacked a consistently ""fast breaking"" attack . The club have struggled to find a consistently consistent attack .
 Because of this they have failed to capitalize on the other teams' mistakes, they haven't been able to take advantage of the mistakes made by other teams . This is because of this, they have not taken advantage of other teams mistakes .
 We have also lacked an effective ""powerplay"" and have not demonstrated any repeated ability to score on the long, well-placed shot . We also lack an effective "powerplay"
 A note of marked improvement over last year is their passing coordination . The passing coordination is a key part of the success of their passing .
 A word of commendation must be extended to our goalies who in the face of blistering attacks have turned in some very good performances on several occasions . Goalies must also be commended for their performances in the past .
 This does not exclude the fact that they have given the opposing team more than their share of gift goals more than once . It is not the first time they have failed to score a single goal in their last five games .
 Because of the poor coaching, the coaches lack the respect of the players, the players say . The coaches lack respect of players, according to the players. Because of that, they lack respect for the players .
 This is the reason that the players have very little ""will to win"" which is a functional part of any team . This is a function of the players' performance . The players have little will to win, which is why they have little desire to win .
 Our coaching staff in the persons of Frasca and Brenin, fails to demand much from the players and as a result fails to command the needed respect needed of a successful team . The coaching staff failed to command respect needed for a successful side, says Frasca .

 The third and final mistake that I shall bring out on the part of the coaches is the recruiting system which can only be described as a catastrophic abortion . The recruiting system is only the third mistake that the coaches have made in the past, the recruitment system is the worst .
 It is a waste of talent and opportunity for those concerned, it points out the inefficient planning on the j of the coaches . It is not the only example of the waste of effort and opportunity .
 We have exceeded all realms of practicality in this respect . We have more than enough players vieing for the available positions on the team . It's desireable it is desireable to have more players .

 In the past seven years the student body has increased only 10 per cent while the faculty has doubled . On enrollment, he emphasized the fact that such a college as CC appeals to ""limited clientele"" in the past .
 An informal poll of the ""ponderers" favored a maximum enrolment of 1,500 students within the next decade . The poll of senior administrators favors a maximum enrollment of 2,500 .
 The danger of admitting students merely on grades and test scores is that a ""new strain of bacteria"" may arise to leap over the College Board fence . The danger is that "American students are pretty good games-men"
 Wanted are students who have not only the mentality but also the potential profit from four years of a liberal education . Wanted: Students who have the mentality and potential profit potential from liberal education.
 Benezet stated the need for an objective view of the dissention in this country over time spent on study versus time spent in campus ""affairs"
 His major point was that students must, besides gaining knowledge, prepare for citizen ship in a future society . Students must also prepare for future society, he said .

 President urged student participation in the upcoming All-College Conference March 17 and 18 . The conference is scheduled for March 17-18 .
 In athletics, a perennial question is what a small college such as CC can do to overcome increased professionalism i n inter collegiate sports since it has lost financial support from gate receipts .
 The answer is men willing to play without subsidy for the sport itself, a supporting student body and opponents willing to take our way . The answer to the question is that they should be able to play their way .
 As long as the student body wants inter-collegiate sports and as long as these games serve the college and not vice versa, CC will continue its scheduling schedule . CC will not change its scheduling policy .
 He also felt that it is CC's duty to bring back soccer and swiming . The new pool is to be completed late in 1963, and that we need more skiing instruction .
 Continuation of the hockey program depends 50 per cent on the acquisition of our own ice both for the team and for recreation, but student enthusiasm for the rink is needed to complete by next fall .
 With the completion of the new sports facilities there will probably be a return to required physical education for men .

 A newly formed group on campus devoted to a discussion of current events met for the first time Tuesday . The group meets in the WfiS room in Rastall Center .
 The purpose of the group was to provide a forum for interested students and faculty who wished to discuss current affairs . Fred A Sondermann, Associate Professor of Political Science, explained that the purpose of this group is to provide an opportunity for current affairs.
 He suggested an informal organization that would meet every other Tuesday except durin K exams . He also proposed a time schedule of from 4:00 to 5:15 in the afternoon for the meetings .
 The group then turned to a debate over the proposed sending of two CC students to a peace conference in Washington . The group also discussed the relationship of France and Algeria .
 The discussion was first concerned about the use of ASCC funds for the trip . The discussion began with concerns about how the funds were used .
 This was discussed at length and then a more general interest in the conference itself captured the attention of the group . The group discussed the conference and the future of the conference .
 ASCC met to discuss the financial issue the following day . ASCC seemed iminent from the group's reaction to the decision .
 All interested students and faculty are urged to attend these meetings . The meetings will be open to all interested students .
 Subsequent meetings will be held on February 20, March 6, and April 10, April 24, and May 8 . The first meeting will be February 20 .
 The next meeting will be held at 4m. in the WF.S Lounge of Rastall Center . The meeting will take place at 4pm.
 The topic for discussion will be the pamphlet ""Westeren Values and Total War" The pamphlet is available for 25 cents at the Rastall desk .
 ASCC meeting of the 1961-fi2 school year tool< took place on February 7 . Probably the most important and well attended ASCC meet of the school year .
 Concerned was the request of two students, Myles Hormer and Harris Sherman, for ASCC funds to allow them to attend ;i Washington, D.C., convention . The two students requested funds to attend the convention .
 ASCC can't allocate funds for participation in or observation of demonstrations by minority groups . ASCC should not be able to allocate funds to participate in or observe demonstrations by minorities, says student bodv .
 Hopper and Sherman and their views, general participation and interest among students was the most lively and pertinent seen in recent ASCC meetings . Hopper, Sherman and Sherman were the speakers .
 The motion was defeated by a 9-4 vote, but a $100 allocation by the Assemblies Committee and contributions by individual members of the CC will allow these two students to attend the convention as observers .
 Despite the unusual and gratifying burst of zeal and interest among a student body usually devoid of such enthusiasm, two things have come to light. Notwithstanding the unusual . burst of enthusiasm, there are two things to be seen: enthusiasm and interest .
 First is recognition of a need to present CC students a look at world situations and minority views . First is the recognition of the need for students to learn about world situations .
 'Commitment' (Myles Hopper, vice-president, and Harris Sherman, president) has tried to do for the past year, he said . 'Their organization has often met with ridicule and rebuke and rebuke,' he added .
 CC students should wake up and look at the world outside . College isolation won't last forever. CC students need to wake up to look outside of campus .
 Washington conference is a start in this direction . Observation and consideration of such activities as the Washington conference will be a good start .
 Second, it became apparent that here is an area where ASCC is deficient . ASCC has a history of failing to adequately address the needs of the organization . The organization has been criticized for its lack of transparency in recent years .
 An informal committee has been formed to study a proposed constitutional amendment . This need has been recognized by Mr Griffiths, says Griffiths .
 This amendment would give ASCC jurisdiction over requests by political and minority groups . It would allow ASCC a review and allocation power over them which it now does not have . ASCC would be able to review and allocate power over requests .
 Tlie mechanizations of this proposal have not yet been worked out, but a step has been made . The proposal is a step in the right direction, but it's not yet worked out .

 It is my hope that this postponement will mean a better conference, anil not result in a lessened interest on the part of the student body . At the All College Conference the student, faculty and administration are given the opporti to gain a better understanding of the problems of
 I hope that the Conference will continue to have the support of all concerned. For this reason, I . hope that I hope . I hope this is the case for all concerned to continue to support .

 The college faculty voted overwhelmingly to replace the present system of reporting all mid-semester grades with a new system for reporting only D and F grades at the mid-term .
 Certain faculty members felt that reoprting grades four times a year puts an undue emphasis on grades as such and tends to perpetuate immaturity rather than to develop maturity .
 Dean Lloyd E Worner: "The wisdom of giving midsemester grades as we now give them has been questioned" "Several times during the past decade the wisdom of . giving mid-semesters grades has been . questioned,"" said Worner . Worner.

 ASCC appropriations policy for various campus activities faces the possibility of major change in the very near future . I olorado SnrmrF. "I'm looking forward to a very exciting future in the U.S. college of engineering engineering engineering .
 At the present time, the primary consideration of the ASCC Finance Committee in its budget hearings is the number of students to be benefited, both directly and indirectly, by an appropriation from the fund . The primary consideration in the committee's budget hearings will be students to benefit from an appropriation .
 ASCC allotment comes directly from fees paid by each individual CC student . This is considered primary since it comes from student fees paid for each individual student .
 The Finance Committee considers the request of other campus organizations, the uses for these proposed appropriations, and their utility to the student body . After this major portion of the budget is budgeted, the Finance Committee will consider the requests of other organizations .
 The only position clarified is the precedent resulting from a recent refusal of the ""Turn Toward Peace"" delegation . The delegation's position has not been clarified .

 "The way in which allotments arise leads to a value judgment which is very hard to make," says David Cameron . "It's very difficult to make. It's the only way to make a value judgement," he says .
 One suggestion that deserves attention is a direct appropriation only to certain key organizations (Nugget, Kinnikinnik, Tiger, Foreign Student Committee, Enthusiasm Committee) and a program fund for all the rest which make requests .
 This fund would be under direct ASCC supervision . It would be used to support activities currently under Citizenship Club, International Relations Club, and others currently in the ASCC budget .
 This proposal would have the merit of including activities currently omitted, although value judgments would still have to be made . The proposal would also include activities that are currently omitted from the list .
 It would also alleviate the practice by organizations currently receiving funds from ASCC, of requesting too much, thereby freezing ASCC resources till the school term ends, then returning the surplus to the Reserve Fund . ASCC funds would also be returned to the reserve fund .

 With such a schedule it is likely that few students would have more than one examination on one particular day .
 Faculty would also have more leisure to grado their final examinations than under the present calendar . Faculty would be able to graduate from the current calendar .
 The reading periods in both semesters would permit review of the work of the semester's work, or perhaps the entire year, depending upon the nature of the course . The reading period would allow students to review their work in both quarters .
 The second semester reading period would provide time for faculty members to make greater use of oral examinations as part of the departmental comprehensive . In addition the second semester .
 Tn the paBt too many faculty members have had to administer departmental comprehensives, grade them, and carry out oral examinations, while teaching their regular course load .
 Dennis Faulk chosen as Holland Fxchunge Student for next year . Faulk has been chosen to study in Holland . Dennis E Faulk will be studying in Holland next year.
 He was selected by the Colorado Colege foreign student committee from nine applicants . The student was selected from a list of nine applicants from nine .
 The final choice was made on the basis of an autobiography, letters of recommendation, and a personal interview with the committee .

 62-63 will be the 7th year CC has sent an exchange student to Holland . CC's exchange program with this particular school in Holland is financed by the administration and contributors from various campus organizations .
 Colorado College's academic calendar has seen several major changes in the last year or so . A freshman knows program, deferred rush, addition of four-hour courses to the curriculum, no midsemester grades other than failures (beginning next year)
 New schedule (going into effect next September) will not be all a bed of roses . New schedule will go into effect in September 2015 .
 The current two week lag after Christmas vacation will be abolished . The final examination period will be finished before Christmas vacation begins .
 By early November many students will be ready for some respite . Christmas vacation will still be more than a month and a half away .
 I have long maintained that vacations should not be cluttered with formal assignments . Perhaps this is as it should be, perhaps this should be . I have always maintained that vacation should not have been cluttered .
 A one month layoff from disciplined study may have a retarding effect on work in the early weeks of the second semester . Language courses, art and music courses may have an impact on work .
 For, unless great effort is spent funding excellent speakers and an extremely vital or interesting subject, many CC students will be found on the ski slopes at symposium time . For, great effort must be spent funding speakers and interesting subjects .
 On the bright side of the change are the reading periods preceding final examinations and the extended final examination periods . The reading periods before final examinations will also be extended, says the Education Commission .
 At the recent All-College Conference I suggested making ""Dead Week"" really dead â no classes at all . At the conference I suggested "Dead Week" really dead .
 The reading periods should prove quite advantageous â in the first semester as both a breathing period and a review period, and as a much-needed time for retrospection and summary before second semester finals . The reading period should be quite advantageous .
 The long exam period will alleviate common problem of two critical exams falling on the same day, allowing little time to sufficiently prepare for either exam . Long exam period means students will have more time to prepare for both exams .
 Early completion of school term will give CC students a jump on other summer job applicants . Another advantage will be the early completion of the school term .

 The average man is the typical man, the man-in-the-street; behaviorists tell us how he develops, and advertisers are interested in him for obvious reasons .
 We also hear a lot about what it takes to be a real man, in terms of physical fitness, or response to women, or military prowess . We also talk about what men should be able to do in the military .
 The Bible, and the Church, in talking of real humanity and true manhood turn in quite a different direction and point to Jesus . Yet the Bible and Church turn in to Jesus, the author says .

 As a recent alumnus of Colorado College, I cannot leave unchallenged the undocumented aspersions cast at the College by student contributors in the TIGER Letters Section .
 Contributor Brigham, in particular, inferred that CC students were permanently beyond censure, but that ""the institution"" as such deserves no praise .
 He did not make clear just what faults were present, e.g., bad food, insufficient academic challenge, inept professors, shabby buildings, or what.g. was present, he said .
 I should imagine that anyone as urbane and glib as Mr Brigham knows that unsupported innuendo is intellectually dishonest . Mr Brigham is a glib glib, glib and witty, but he should know he's intellectually dishonest, he says .
 His sort of smug, unbased, 3 nd rlleeting insinuations seem to reflect more upon him as an observer than upon the object observed . His smug and unbased insinuations reflect more on him as a observer than on the object .
 All available space normally used for this sort of thing was full, says Mr Cowles . College's goals and ideals have been seriously tarnished, he says .
 Contributor Cowles seems irretrievably submerged in his disillusionment with College brochures . I find this state of affairs (i.e., so much cultural activity that it cannot be properly housed) singularly encouraging .
 In spite of this, Miss MeConnell seems to resent going into debt to subsidize a portion of her education, thinking that it should come free . She says she wants her education to be free .
 The worth of a Colorado College degree is substantially greater than the average . O00 above what she could have earned in a lifetime without it, she says .
 More importantly, there are rewards from it which cannot be measured in dollars . The rewards from the project are not measured in monetary value .
 Miss MeConnell thinks that the College is fast becoming a ""Country Club,"" but it is a strange Country Club which has so many of its members waiting on tables, mopping floors at night, oitending the lawns .
 I would invite the critics to match the alumni of CC with those of any other college or university in the country in wits, income, position, position and most importantly, in major contribution to society on all levels .
 "I would also invite the critics to match CC itself with any other in the country in terms of academic challenge, diversity of student body, close relationships between faculty and student, brilliance and dedication of the faculty, together with a nottoo-austere social opportunity .
 It would be novel to see the critics support their views, with some verifiable evidence, with evidence .
 If it has become stickily sentimental or unfashionable to express pride in one's college, then I prefer to remain in the ranks of the obsolete . If it is too fashionable, I would rather remain in ranks of obsolete .
 Nothing is more helpful than a blazing, documented attack with concrete proposals for innovation, but vague castigation has always seemed unworthy of any serious consideration . Nothing more helpful is more .
 One of our students asked Dr. Bob Waymire to share his knowledge of his work with students .
 Mr. Morganthau was asked to comment on a quotation which was read from a sheet of excerpts from the writings of Messrs. Morganthalau . He was read by a member of the British Parliament .
 This sheet had been compiled on the basis of the reading of some of my students, and did not contain identification of sources . Brodie, Millis, and Morganthau had been distributed prior to the Symposium .
 Morganthau disclaimed having written the sentences in question; he felt they represented neither his style nor his thought . Morganthanau felt the sentences represented neither style nor thought . He disclaimed to have written them, saying they were not his style .
 I had been concerned about this matter ever since, but just recently found the time to check into it . "I had had a lot of time to think about it," she says of the matter .
 I think it's perfectly understandable that a person who does as much writing as Dr. John Sutter is writing as much as he does . Dr. Sutter: "I think it is perfectly understandable" that a writer who does so much writing is writing so much is writing .
 Morganthau does may very well forget this or that specific sentence or paragraph, particularly when confronted with it for the first time in over two years . He may forget it all, especially when confronted by it's first time he's confronted by the book's author .

 An attempt is made to publicize events, but no number of signs can take the place of some discussion of events prior to their happening . An attempt at publicizing events is made, but it is not the first time they are made public .

 Mr Blackburn feels that we need to create an atmosphere for social mixing in an informal situation . Mr Blackburn said that he wants to create a social atmosphere .
 The small college atmosphere, shyness or lack of opportunity on the part of both men and women students, are reasons for this . The attitude of men students that the women want to get too serious is also a factor .
 Social functions which can include freshmen students will have to .be held on the all-college level . Social functions must be held at the same college level .
 Perhaps this would keep more of the girls on campus, instead of attempting to fill their social gap at the institution not far to the north . Perhaps this is a good idea .
 The number of cars among freshmen students would probably be quite low if they were allowed . This decision was made by the administration, and the number of vehicles among freshmen is probably low .

 Mr Brossman then proceeded to his second area of concern, a new health center . The health center is one of his two areas of concern .

 The cold war threatens to become hot because the unsolved political issues serve as a tangible focus upon which the fears and suspicions of the cold war can concentrate, seeking release in armed conflict .
 "Fear and suspicion there would still be, but of a different sort of sort," says author of the book "Cold War"
 "There would be fear and suspicion of ourselves, rather than of the other fellow," he said . "We would be afraid of ourselves," he added. "We wouldn't be fearful of ourselves."
 We would fear lest our vision and ingenuity not equal to the task upon whose achievement the fate of the world depends, we would fear . We would not be able to fail to achieve the task on our vision .
 We suspect that we might not possess the determination and courage required . We would suspect that they might not have the courage and courage to tackle the task .
 Cold war would then have become a contest between two conceptions of man, two principles of social and political organization, two visions of mankind's future . For the cold war would have become what it has always been primarily; a contest .
 It will be settled, after negotiations have done their work on the political plane, by the nobler and weightier act of performance, says Simon Tisdall .

 Football in a business sense is pricing itself out of its market . Dean Juan Reid in an article ""That 'Big Game' Costs Big Money,"" showed that football in a . business sense was pricing itself . out of a market .
 This situation has been created by ever-increasing costs, which keep coaches away from their other coaching assignments, and ""big time" standards . The situation is created by increasing costs, and only ""small time"
 Colorado College's geopraphic location isolates it from other colleges of its type . There seems to be no ready-made solution for Colorado College, except to continue to exert its influence on the other members of the Rocky Mountain Conference .

 Miss Ellen Claydon of the Colorado College Spanish Department came up with some interestingthoughts on theories of literary criticism and literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .
 This approach has been applied chiefly to the Renaissance and que periods in literary hisperiods which formerly were not clearly distinguished . The Renaissance and Queque periods are thought to be the most important periods in literature .
 In Spain, the span of time from 1516 to 1680 was simply called The Golden Age . The span of the time between 1516 and 1680 is known as 'The Golden Age' In Spain it was known as the Golden Age.
 We now see two very different cultural atmospheres iluring the 10th and 17th centuries . We see a very different culture between the two centuries .
 We have now realized that a high degree of ornamentation, lack of clarity, intense contrast and desequilibriconstituted an artistic theory which reflected the taste and feelings of the times . We have . now â  to realize that . an ornamentation . lack of . clarity
 We in the 20th century are much more capable uf accepting the desirability of this aesthetic as we we have deâ eloped tastes similar to those of the 17th century . We are more capable of accepting this aesthetic than those of 17th .
 The classic aesthetic is considered the onl y aesthetic of the Greco-Roman cultures . Critics have been arguing it for centuries â as far back as the Middle Ages and certainly in the k and Roman cultures .
 Let us examine briefly and :ontrast of these two aesthetics on i very schematic level . The two aesthetics are very different and very schematic on a schematic level.
 It proposes that man is perfect, or at least apable of reachingperfection . It proposes man is apable to reach perfection, or to be perfect .
 Even man's body is potentially a perfect, beautiful structure . He s, after all, created after the image of God; he has a divine soul i approximates God's divinity .
 This attitude of acceptance and even ennoblement of man produces a serenity and an optimism . We have only to look at a Renaissance painting to see this dearly. This attitude .
 There is a sense of balance, equilibrium, and serenity in â  h a painting . The painting was created in the 1930s and 1940s in New York .
 The human figure is nearly perfect and so is the world in which he is pictured . The human figures are nearly perfect, and so are the world around him .
 The artistic technique itself is conceived in the light of perfection, as formulas and theories are developed and written down which pretend to have worked out the perfect art form .
 Weste m man rebels against a rational concept of himself and a restricof his creativity into rigid forms . The Weste man rebeles against a . rational concept .
 In the BatQ quo period, the principal conflict, due to the great religious druggies of the day, became sensuality versus spirituality . The principal conflict was sensuality vs. spirituality .
 It was accepted fact that the only real id important thing in the life of man was the salvation of his â soul . Yet irrationaly, man could not avoid being sensual being and thus enjoying the world .
 There was intense concern with moral conduct, for while there was an accepted standard, one had only to look around to see that no one adhered to it . There was an intense concern for moral conduct .
 The world was falling apart, for this was the period of the Thirty Years War in Germany in which nearly every European nation was participating and ill .
 Kings and courtiers lived in extreme luxury and selfindulgence while the populace was dying of starvation . Kings and their courtiers . lived in . extreme luxury while the . populace died of starvation while the population was dying .
 Man struggled to avoid viewing himself as an animal or a base being in spite of the reality which would convince him otherwise . He struggled to see himself as a human or a human being .
 Sometimes he succeeded, other times he sank into a bitter cynicism which at least afforded him some defense against despair . Sometimes he failed to succeed, sometimes he did, sometimes his cynicism allowed him to be cynical .
 They manifest themselves in great contrasts among characters â the noble lord and the materialistic, sensula servant â in contrasts of ideals within the character . Love versus loyalty and loyalty are contrasts between tragedy and comedy within the same work .
 'Multiple plots' appear in the form of a multiple plot which produces confusion in the reader or the audience . The same confusion which life produced on those who live in the 17th century .
 The artist may even take refuge from a depressing reality in an attitude of 'art for art's sake' where the content of his art is of no significance, but the art feeds on itself .

 Assembly's goal was a final report representing a consensus of student opinion on possible methods of implementing U.S. disarmament and arms control program . The Assembly was created by students at the University of Washington State University .
 The task filled twelve hours of small group discussions, small groups of small groups . Harold Stassen, Ernest Lefever of the Institute of Defense Analysis, and a panel of authorities .
 The keynote address was delivered by Harold Stassen, former Governor of Minnesota, who served from 1055-58 with cabinet rank as special assistant on disarmament to President Eisenhower .
 Mr Stassen maintained that pursuit of ""narrow nationalism" would fall short of America's basic ideological commitment toward man's fullest development .
 In this context he examined various proposals for dealing with Russia in the nuclear age . He also examined proposals for how to deal with Russia .
 Forseeing the possibility of carefully controlled partial disarmament, Stassen advocated the establishment of two arms control zones . The realization of the second dependent upon success in the first, the first .
 United Nations inspection-detection stations would be installed and manned bv both the United States and U.S.R. and members of the United Nations No nuclear weapons and a reduction of armed forces and their armaments would be agreed upon .
 Stassen: Air inspection with open skies, aerial photography and aerial photography would be established . Backing these controls, he said: "efficient unfailing communications methods"
 An arms deal would be only a "beginning of" the begin, niilg"" in arms agreements, but for each nation it would be an important first step . To be sure, this would be the beginning of a new arms agreement .
 The geographic area would include a portion of the Ukraine, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, portions of Denmark, West Germany and France . All of Berlin and all of Berlin would be included .
 With these two areas established, other zones, both geographic and substantive, could be established . Other zones could also be established, including geographical and substantive .
 Stassen argued that small, seemingly immaterial gains must be realized before other more encompassing agreements are possible . In short, he said that small gains can't be realized without other agreements .
 He saw the 1957 disarmament talks plus his own personal experience with the Russians as good evidence of possible acceptance . Supported the possibility of these limited zoned agreements .
 Such an agreement would not limit national security because of the possibility of continuing military activity in outside zones . Such as agreement would also not limit military activity outside zones, officials say .

 Thorn Verhave is a scientist at the Presbyterian Institute of Medical Sciences in San Francisco . He gave a series of talks recently at Colorado College .
 Verhave has made significant contributions to psychology in the area of avoidance conditioning . He is most famous for his success with using pigeons as instruments for detecting defective capsules .
 Verhave's lecture at Perkins Hall on March 20th was his more recent work with ""values and preferences"" of pigeons . Verhave was speaking about his work with pigeons in his lecture .
 In spite of his future plans to use human babies in experimentation, many students appeared to be skeptical of the application of information derived from "pigeon" experiments to human beings .
 Verhave avoided making philosophical interpretations of ""dynamic equilibrium"" in human behavior . Verhave also avoided makingÂ philosophicalÂ interpretationsÂ of the "dynamicÂ equilibrium"
 Such statements would have been far removed from research psychology, but more important, such statements could never accurately describe the problems with which Dr. Dr. John Defterios has dealt with . Such statements are far from accurate and far from the psychology of research psychology .
 Snyder presented the facts on each of these concepts, and noted the advantages and disadvantages of each . Snyder also discussed the advantages of each of the concepts . Snyder: "It's a good thing to say 'Yes'

 This calls for nuclear retaliation which is equal to the destructive yield of the first strike .
 It is felt that this slow motion total war would bring great pressure on the antagonistic powers to stop and negotiate the differences .
 Snyder suggested that there are parallels between philosophical questions which have been asked for centuries about the ""nature of man"" and experimental questions asked in modern psychology . Snyder explained that this is by far the most feasible idea, especially in consideration of what he described as ""the declining credibility of United States

 Only limited disarmament in Stassen's mind is more feasible in increasing the stability and security of nations, he says .
 He did not deny that even in a limited program risks are not involved . However, he did say that even if there is no risk, risks were not involved in it .
 The point which demands consideration here is what will happen if, in fact, no agreement is reached . The point of concern is that no agreement has been reached .
 Governor Stassen was articulate in his criticisms of other proposed programs . Governor was critical of the proposed program .
 Stassen noted that in 1817 an arms control agreement was reached between America and England in an atmosphere of distrust . To those who argue ""no agreements with Russia are possible because of past history and ideological bipolarity,"" Stassens said .
 Under the agreement, cancelation could come in six months; it never did . The cancellation of the deal never happened .
 To those who maintain Russia breaks agreements at will, Stassen recalled the Austrian and Finnish peaces, settlements in Iran, and acceptance of the United Nations charter .
 Some theorize that internal explosions in Russian rule would result if exploited by external pressures . Russia's internal explosions could be caused by internal pressures .
 Governor Stassen noted there is little historical evidence that Russia would yield under external pressure . To this analysis, he noted there are little historical .
 Internal explosions might, in the end, involve the whole world . More serious, however, is the possibility that internal explosions might involve the entire world .
 Neither does he have any regard for the unilateral disarmament advocate . He has no respect for unilateral disarmaments advocates .
 To those who suggest Ghandi's approach, Stassen would only remind them of Tibet and Hungary . The Dutchman's approach to the world's first war zone would be reminiscent of Tibet .
 Four approaches to arms control have been suggested in the Assembly's panel addresses .
 Addison Lanier, Walter Millis and Thomas Schelling of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions at Harvard speak . The panelists also discuss the role of the Secretary of Defense for National Security Affairs . The group also includes Walter Schelling and William It.
 Lanier criticized U.S. past proposals as but reshuffuffuffled rearrangements of prejudices .
 Little effective governmental machinery is operational with all disarmament efforts being carried on outside the Departments of State and Defense . Not only do we lack originality anil sincerity but also lack sincerity, but little effective government machinery .
 Mr Lanier also suggested we would do well to look at arms control approaches as a national policy instead of approaching the question with divergent, specific measures .
 Mr Millis' approach to disarmament had not changed since his appearance at Colorado College, only his phrasing was different . As presupposed, he said: "As with the world, disarmament is a matter of principle"
 Maintaining that disarmament is not a practical goal, Mr Millis felt any conference, no matter how conclusive, will attain no desired objectives . Maintains that any conference will attain any desired objectives, he said .
 At present only a stabilization of forces is possible, and desirable . To be sure, however, disarmament is not ultimately impossible, but at present only stabilization is possible .
 Before complete disarmament can be attained, ""demilitarization" must accompany such a procedure . For, before completeÂ disarmamentÂ can't be achieved, "demilitaryÂ activity" must be completed .
 He defined demilitarization as concerned with policy, power, and governmental relations . He defined it as concerned about policy and power, policy, and relations .
 The danger in Millis' mind is the possibility of attaining control of weapons without demilitarization, he says . Millis says the danger in his mind is that the danger is that it could be achieved without disarmament . The U.S. should not be allowed to
 As we know, he regards war as obsolete and unrelated to the interest of today's states . War is not a matter of national interest, he says .
 He concluded that realistic proposals must be drawn in the contest of the cold war . Thus he concluded that . realistic proposals should be drawn .
 Schelling believed that a diplomacy in arms can be attained under which each nation stabilizes its deterrent forces . Schelling believes that each nation's deterrent forces can be stabilised under a diplomatic agreement .
 Becker's Radiator & Body Shop is located at E Bijou St. Call ME 3-0075 Radiator, Body & Fender Repairing and Painting Repairing & Painting .
 Schelling's analysis was that even complete disarmament would not erase future redevelopment of weapons . Schelling said knowledge cannot he destroyed short of universal brain surgery .
 He also noted that, when a situation arises making negotiation possible, a dilemma also arises, that of whether to be accommodating or tough .
 Schelling reached no conclusion on this point other than that one should be accommodating when the Russians are and tough when they are . Schelling: "One should be accommodated when Russia is and likewise tough when it is."
 It was left to the next speaker to analyze past approaches to agreement . The next speaker will discuss the future of the U.S. government .
 William R Frye has covered the U.N. for a decade . He has grown to know Soviet maneuvers as well as our own . Frye: "I'm not surprised by the way the United States has behaved in the past."
 He is critical of past U.S. maneuvers of making disarmament proposals with ""built-in jokers"" which make Russians agreement impossible . For example, he says, he is critical .

 CC Tour Choir presented a concert of ""Sacred Music for the Easter Season,"" which truly showed depth and insight; into the material being performed . I realize the Easter Program CC Choir Shows Depth and Insight .
 Emphasis was placed where it ought to be â on the thoughtful interpretation of the music rather than on having a polished professional-like performance .
 I'm by no means suggesting that there was anything sloppy about the presentation . Yet I am by no . means that there were any sloppy moments in the presentation. Yet I'm not saying that there is anything sloppy .
 It is a precise alert choir, able to produce a good choral sound which is always fitting to the stylo of tlie music being sung .
 Slow tempo of Thomas Morley's ""Agnus Dei,"" did not drag due to the rich choral sound and the effective use of dynamics . For example, the slow tempo of the slow . tempo of "Agnas Dei" was not dragged .
 Mr Jenkins managed to manipulate these dynamics and sounds to fit in with every element of the piece as they came, resulting in a beautiful performance which was over quickly .
 "Babylon,"" by Darius Milhaud, whose difficult and almost encophonus harmonies were ably handeled by Mr Jenkins and the choir . Another high spot was ""Babylyla,"" which was a difficult piece by the composer . The choir was
 The words, telling of the fall of the majestic city of Babylon, are well suited to the musical style . The choir showed that it was well aware of this relationship in its majestice and convicted approach .
 This pice showed the depth and sensitivity of Mr Jenkins' approach and the responsiveness of the choir to understand their conductor . It was the first time the choir had ever heard a performance of such a performance .
 The only unfortunate part of the concert was that the largest and most ambitous effort of the choir had to be sung from the choir loft for technical reasons, and some of the magnificense of the work was lost .
 The choir did not demonstrate the strong conviction of the choir as did the rest of the program, probably due to the difficulty of projecting focused and delicate choral sound from the loft .
 There is no more satisfying artistic experience than hearing a group of musicians dedicated to expressing the meaningful essence of the music being performed rather than appearing polished .
 CC Tour Choir projected sensitively a very meaningful program . The latter often leads to brash impersonal results, while the latter often results impersonal .

 CU French Department Presents Rhinoceros by Jay Hemingway . Inesco's RHINOCEROS is a difficult play to perform .
 C.U.'s attempt at the production is maddening to an infant making an effort to articulate . For that reason I am sympathetic with C.A.U.âs attempt to stage the production .
 C.C.U.'s Berenger fostered an inflexible pathetic' drone, author says . "Even in the final act when relief from his overbearing timidity is planned, he remained encrusted in effeminacy"
 Perhaps he confused timidity with naivety, perhaps the factor above all others that could have distinguished him from those who succumbed, and redeemed him from their fate . "Authenticite" may have been the key to distinguishing him from the others .
 Despite all of Berenger's pathetic qualities and the absurdity of the setting, one does, as does Ionesco, sympathize with his agony, his awareness of bis incompatibility with the environment, and with the incontrolability of the evolutionary trend .
 Mr Neely barely suggested the tragic authenticity; let Berenger ride as monotonous and ridiculous pathos . The film is set in New York City, New York .
 Jean Jean, Daisy, Le Vieux, Le Logician, and M Papillon should likewise be complimented . Le Logicians, Le Vignon, and Le Vieaux are also complimented for their work .
 Le Logicien dominated the scene through little if any fault of his own, since the part asks to be overplayed . The role was overplayed, but it was not his fault .
 Instead of balancing his majestic hamuiiness with rapid conversation, Jean and Berenger seemed to be hesitantly awaiting their cues, as if unsure what was to come .
 Richard M Pearl of the Colorado College geology department has had his latest book published . Pearl is a geologist at Colorado College .
 The distinctive fea'ture of this book is that, in addition to telling about various rocks and minerals, it is the only book that describes three incidents of children making important discoveries in this field .
 Thirteen of these books fall under the heading of tradebooks written for the general public . Thirteen tradebooks are written in the form of trade books for the public .

 Colorado Springs Symphony I mJ # I * * Conduct Committee Nominates Candidates . Conduct Committee is conducting a symphony orchestra in Colorado Springs .
 Were it not for his high pitched scratchy voice Le Vieux Monsieur would have been more successful . The French singer's voice was more successful in France than the UK .
 Besides Berenger's ineptness, this unnaturalness inhibited and slowed down the play . Berengers' ineptness inhibited the play, but also slowed down play .
 RHINOCEROS is spottily successful; that in itself being erroneous . Though avoided by the laudable efforts of M Papillon, Daisy, and Duard C.U.'S. U.C.U.âs RHINocEROS .
 The setting for Act I was refreshing in a quaint, unpressed Chagalian way . The quilted setting for the play was refreshingly unpressressed .
 The sets for Acts II and III were, if anything, simple and functional . Though as with a sigh of accomplishment the set designer's efforts ended there .
 The costumes were neither spectacular nor inoffensive, and properly so . The costumes are neither spectacular or inoffensive .
 The Logicien may have appeared more absurd had his dress conformed with that of Le Vieux Monsieur . The only exception was the Logicien .
 Le Vieux Monsieur and Jean was either crude or too damn casual . The make-up on the other hand, of the pair was either too casual or crude .
 Jean's metamorphosis while it could have been visually hysterical, it seemed unnecessarily reserved and awkwardly allusive . Jean's transformation was awkward, awkward and awkward .
 Poor timing between the two pianos hampered the somewhat romanticized second movement, and it was not until Babin rallied with some exceptionally clean-cut counterpoint in the third movement fugue .
 The strings performed their simple tasks adequately throughout the concerto . The strings did not disappoint .
 The first of the four movements spent most of its time passing out solos all around the orchestra to a simple string accompaniment . The first movement of the symphony was played by the orchestra in four movements .
 The whole effect was somewhat disjointed and monotonous due to the many repetitions of the melodic material . The sound of the album was somewhat monotonial .
 The second movement held together a little better because of the persistent beat in the background . It ran into troubles with the orchestra stumbling over itself in the attempt to hang onto the tortuous rhythm .
 The short nocturnal third movement attempted to relv on orchestral color for its appeal . It would have become tedious if it had been any longer .
 The fourth movement began with some busy-sounding but fairly obvious counterpoint . The piece was composed of four pieces .
 An attempt toward the end to blend in some material from the third movement was rough and flared rather badly . An attempt to blend into the music was rough, flared badly .
 The writing for the two pianos was somewhat more interesting than most of the rest . Throughout the concerto the writing was more interesting .
 Airline played a Brazilian Dance by Milhaud and an Italian Polka by Rachmaninoff . The video was sent to the Denver airport in Colorado .
 The former is a stupid little piece with Latin rhythms and a melody, of sorts, in octaves . The former was a bit of a staid little piece .
 The Rachmaninoff sounded like bad ragtime, with an oom-pah bass and melody in thirds . It was like bad Ragtime with a bass bass and a melody of thirds .
 The orchestra alone then played New Dance by Wallingford Riegger and Vienna Life by Johann Strauss . The orchestra then played the two pieces by Strauss .
 The usual sore of concert humdrum was well performed except for some ragged entrances in the strings . It was well-performed but some of the strings were ragged .
 This performance was remarkably good on the whole, but suffered from occasional slippiness in the woodwind ensemble, unevenness in some of the string dynamics, and too fast a tempo .

 In the past there have been very few interested (interested enough to voice opinions) students to turn to . However, in the past few students have turned to students to voice their opinions .
 Attendance at class meetings and the regular Monday meetings of ASCC has been undeniably poor . Attendance has been extremely low at ASCC meetings .
 Only freshmen have made an attempt at seeking participation in meetings, only freshmen . Attendance is dwindling as the year progresses, the school says .
 One interested party or group of students could do much to alleviate this vacuum of interest . Two parties could eliminate it by providing effective presentation of differing views on vital questions to ASCC council members .
 The second, and most important currently, would be the creation of interest in campus elections, and the drawing up of platforms for those elections . Campus elections would also be the focus of campus elections .
 They have also objected that neither Mr Power nor Mr Chase have made any specific proposals for next year . They say Mr Power and Chase have not made specific proposals .
 The fault in this area lies mostly with the CC students and not with the candidates . And yet, the fault in the area lies mainly with the students, not with candidates .
 The suggested candidates for writein did not. They were interested enough and had enough foresight to petition . They were the ones interested enough to petition for the writein .
 This sort of presentation cannot be very dynamic unless the candidates know what CC students want . The candidates must know what students want. This is not the first time they have been asked to present .
 "Hopefully a genuine interest in the campus rather than an underlying affinity for controversy at any cost is the basis for the recent interest," says the author of the book .

 Shove Chapel Parents' Weekend Su day, April 29 'Mary â the Blessed Serm> Blessed Mother' Shove chapel parents' weekend .
 There will be a Parents' Weekend Service in Shove Chapel this coming Sunday morning .
 The triumphant events of Easter are past, and the church has celebrated the victory over sin and death wrought by Jesus Christ . This Easter is a time to celebrate the victory of sin over sin .
 In the figure of Mary, the mother of Jesus, we see an example of one who humbly lived by the Word of God spoken to her through her own Son . We see a example of a humbly humbled woman who lived by her own Word .
 On this Parents' Weekend, and with Mothers' Day fast approaching, it was thought appropriate to speak about the mother of Christ .
 It appears to the preacher that certain serctions of the church have over-emphasized the importance of Mary, and that other sections of church have not given her enough attention and importance .
 She is an example to us of one who put first things first and of one . One who acted as an agent of the will of God in the world, she said .

 Last week's TIGER carried a review by Joseph Wilcox of the final symphony concert, with the well known pianists, Vronsky and Babin, as soloists .
 "I believe this review has limited validity, because the writer appears to be an extremist in matters of musical taste and judgment," says the reviewer .
 Wilcox gives his own, mostly negative account of the concert without reporting the very enthusiastic reaction of the audience . Mr Wilcox also fails to report the audience's enthusiastic reaction .
 The tone of the review does not reflect the opinions and attitudes of the music faculty . Finally, I wish to emphasize that the tone is that of the staff .
 It reflects only the fact that we do believe in freedom of expression and that we welcome and encourage independent thinking . It reflects that we believe in free speech and we welcome independent thinking, the BBC says .
 Mr Wilcox is a junior music major with undeniable talent as a composer of experimental, ""avante garde"" tendencies .
 His originality and intellectual independence are valuable assets for artistic selfexpression, but limit his qualifications as a music critic . He says his originality is valuable assets, but his intellectual independence limits his qualifications for a critic .
 "He is forced to measure and evaluate by his own standards, with all his strong personal prejudices, likes and dislikes, which are rather unique," he says .
 The Bach concerto with which the symphony program opened opened is Bach's first solo concerto . "I have performed several times" Bach's "Bach concerto" has been played by the orchestra .
 With the exception of a minor slip in the beginning (which can happen to every artist) I found the performance delightful and highly artistic .
 Babin's concerto for two pianos and orchestra is 'brilliantly written work with deep insight into this complicated medium'
 "It employs a moderately modern idiom, unmistakably contemporary, and very effective," says the author .
 It is a composition which speaks to heart, soul and emotions rather than to the brain . It's a composition that speaks to the heart and emotions, rather than the brain, it's said .
 The result of the performance was a near-ovation for Mr Babin, something that does not happen often to contemporary composers . The result was the performance of the composer's first piece, which he has since composed .
 Mr Eisenberg and the orchestra deserve much praise for staying together in the extremely difficult second movement . The orchestra deserves much praise from the composer .
 A movement to run a write-in campaign for a third party in the election of ASCC president failed, not bocause enthusiasm and support were lacking, but because such a move is not sanctioned by the ASCC .
 This movement arose from the fnct that at Inst some students are trying to meet the problems of apathy and the lack of objective leadership on campus head on . Inst students say they want to meet these problems head on. This movement is a movement that arose from a discussion of the lack
 All previous talk of combating apathy and certain ""isolationist" tendencies of various campus groups has fallen aside . But ail that is spoken of above will fall by the way much like all previous talk has fallen away .
 The solution lies in only one path, namely, to make ASCC the effective representative organ of the entire campus that it should and must be . ASCC should be an effective representative of the campus, rather than a representative of campus .
 ASCC cannot do this without the support of and the recognition of its legitimate powers by all the various ""individual interest" groups on campus . ASCC will not be able to continue to run ASCC without recognition from all the other students .
 Each group must be represented on ASCC and must submit to the complete ruling of ASCC on all-campus matters . But each group must therefore submit to ASCC's complete ruling on all campus matters .
 First, there would be a total reorganization of ASCC to include more organizations on the campus . First, the reorganization would include more groups on campus .
 This would allow more divergent groups to meet on equal grounds to discuss common problems . Second, this would allow them to meet more diverging groups to discuss problems .
 The president of ASCC must .be recognized by the students and faculty and administration as the head of the student body . Lastly, the president of the ASCC should . be recognized by . students .
 It may be argued that certain changes in the ASCC constitution have laid the ground work for all that has been said above . The ASCC has been criticised for its constitution changes .
 It will unfold all over campus because students are acting on what they say and feel, not just talking . Students will be acting on their feelings and actions, not talking, says CNN.com's Rob Greene .
 It is a complete lack of faith in democratic principles when only one man runs for the office of treasurer of the student body . Only one man ran for the position of treasurer .
 Let's get out and vote, but be sure you vote for the man of issues, not face and charm . Let's vote for a man of character, strength and leadership, not a face and charisma .
 Nothing can be done about the presidency, but be sure to follow through in the other positions . Follows through in other positions, including the presidency .
 Jim Knapp has been trying to enter the ASCC presidential election . Knapp is a member of the American College of Design and Design Designate .
 The precise subject concerns the disunity and resulting limited interest In the college as a whole, and the possible solution of some of these limitations . In the future, the college will be able to find a solution to some of its limitations .
 The term segregation may be used because of the apparent parallels of ignorance and bigotry which cause both racial and group differences . Segregation may also be seen as a sign of ignorance or bigotry .
 On Sunday night a meeting was organized in order to initiate an understanding between antagonistic individuals . The meeting was held in an attempt to start an understanding .
 Present at the meeting were Myles Hopper, Harris Sherman, Mike Grace, John Stickney, John Simus, Wayne Deutscher, Jerry Hillhouse, and Al Church . The meeting was also attended by Harris Sherman .
 The meeting initially was to dispell some of the misunderstandings between the individuals and to create a common basis of communication . The meeting was initially intended to dispelling some misunderstandings .
 As the meeting progressed and the individuals exuressed their personal opinions, it was clear that an understanding and a healthy respect for other views was reached .
 The unanimity of feeling was astounding, particularly considering the preconceived ideas of the participants . "The unanimity was astounding," the author says .
 A true educational process and experience had taken place and the group began to feel that it might be to the good to have other such discussions to promote the understanding of opposing views .
 The conclusion was that groups, whether loosely or tightly organized, were the main reason for segregation and restriction of communication . Group groups were the reason for the segregation, the study found .
 The feeling was that these groups tended to think that they thought that they were more important than the college as a whole . The feeling of these groups was that they had more important to the college .
 "An antagonistic segregation occurs without either of the individuals attempting to understand one another," says author .
 The discussion next led to specifically how this spirit and interest in communication could be initiated .
 An eventually proposed solution was to possibly run a candidate or candidates for ASCC positions . The ASCC has been criticized for not running candidates for the position .
 Candidates would run on specific platforms which would cause discussion among individuals of divergent views . These candidates would run for specific platforms . Candidates will run on platforms that would cause debate among people with divergent opinions .
 Campus factions would begin to understand one another more fully, and could begin to benefit from, rather than restrict, each other . Thus diverse campus factions would benefit from each other more fully .

 The purpose was to create more interest in the election and thereby motivate differing individuals to discuss issues . The purpose of the event was to encourage people to vote for the president .

 International Settlements Through International Law by Max S Power . Dr. Power: "International Settlements through International Law"
 His talk was liberally interspersed with specific examples and even Biblical references . His talk began by distinguishing two kinds of disputes .
 Law is the "practical translation of the morals, customs, and experiences of human beings" into workable principles, Dr. Dr. John Defterios says .
 A dispute involving both political and legal questions can be much more easily solved if the legal issues are settled first by legal means and the political issues are then solved by political means . He went on to say that such a dispute can be easily solved by both legal and political issues .
 Larson contended that there are at least four reasons why this approach can be more effective . Larson: There are four reasons that this approach is more effective. Larson: It's a good idea to use the same approach as the other .
 The second reason is that a party certain of its legal rights in a dispute is not going to give in to political attempts to take away those rights . The parties are certain of their legal rights and will not give in on political efforts to take them away .
 The parties realize that if the negotiations fail there will be an authoritative decision on the merits . The third reason is that negotiations over present rights will be more serious and productive .
 Larson went on to point out that we now have the building blocks of an international legal system . Larson: We now have a building block of a global legal system. Larson: It's a good step forward for the future of the world .
 The last of these is currently the object of much research on the part of Dr. Dr. John Defterios of the U.S.
 The second basis for international law is the machinery to apply that law . The machinery is the basis for applying that law, the second basis is the law itself .
 Larson said the International Court of Justice at the Hague presently provides that machinery . Larson said that the Hague is providing that machinery. Larson said he hopes the court will be able to hear the case .
 It has 15 distinguished jurists, including many of the world's leading international lawyers .
 Larson assured the audience that the influx of Communists on the court is negligible . Larson: "The influx of Communist Communists is negligible"
 He contended that this is entirely possible and pointed to a number of historical examples to back up his statement .
 Many nations have not accepted the jurisdiction of the world court, Larson said .
 Larson launched on a convincing argument for the repeal of our Connally Ammendment . Larson says the amendment was repealed by a repeal of the law . Larson: "It's a good idea to repeal the law"
 Larson says all treaties should include "compromissory clauses" in which parties to the treaty agree that disputes about the treaty will be referred to the World Court . Larson: All treaties should have 'compromisory clauses' in which the parties agree they will refer disputes to the

 In regard to Professor Kutche's talk on human evolution on the 24th of last month: Professor Kutsche stressed the importance of cultural evolution, but his example of cultural selection became rather far fetched .
 Any detrimental genes, such as those causing poor eyesight and hearing, are neutralized by therapy such as glasses .
 We don't know which way we want to move, for we're not sure what constitutes genetic progress . We're living in a state of uncertainty about genetic progress, says Dr. Andrew Hammond .
 Kutsche mentioned that there were data indicating that arteriosclerosis and some kinds of heart disease were being selected against . The reproductive rate of these individuals was lower than that of the rest of the population .
 Kutsche admitted that the theories drawn from these data were largely speculative, and that the data were inadequate . But, Kutsche himself admitted that, K Deutsche himself, he admitted that .
 Much more must be learned about the genetic and environmental sources of these diseases, Kutsche admitted .
 Natural selection is NOT still going on in exactly the same way that it always has been . Contrary to Kutsche, natural selection is still going to be going on .
 Hereditary diseases such as diabetes and phenylketonuria, a disease causing mental retardation, are on the increase .
 Modchampion of every 21 year old girl on this campus â may God have mercy on my soul. Although cultural evolution, as Kutsche said, is extremely important, because of it . Because of it, through the preservation of lives by modchampion, .

 A weekly all city gang fight might provide the desired physical impetus that we need to eliminate the mandatory ROTC course . But then again, a weekly gang fight may provide just the needed physical impetus for eliminating the mandatory course .
 Many detrimental genes are being perpetuated and are building up in the population . I'll see you later  ern medicine and welfare,   .
 Studies on mice, Drisophila (fruit flies), and human inbreeding indicate that 20% of mankind carry a detrimental gene obtained from the previous generation .
 Over successive generations, the buildup of these genes would be fantastic . The buildup of this gene pool would be 'fantastic' over generations .
 Any attempt to neutralize these detrimental genes by therapy, as Kutsche suggests, would be ultimately self-defeating . civilization would have to devote so much time and energy to the therapy of its genetically degenerate populace, that no time would be left for anything else .
 Much more work needs to be done, says Kutsche . The data is much more adequate than that given by Kutsche, much more work must be done .
 The statement that eugenists almost never admit this publicly is false is false . Our knowledge of this field is inadequate, but the statement is false, he says . The statement is not enough, he adds .
 Muller wrote a book on the subject of homosexuality in the U.S. in the 1980s . Muller's work on the topic has been published in the past .
 This passage should also help to answer reasons 2 and 3 of Kutche's, given at the beginning of the article . This passage also helps to answer why Kutche said Kutche was wrong to question Kutche .
 The social and biological dangers of genetic manipulation are great, and that our knowledge in the fields of genetic and supra-genetic evolution is presently inadequate .

 CC was well represented by Ben Lyon as Pooh-Bah and Wallace Boyce as Pish-Tush . Ben Lyon was also well represented as Poah-Bah .
 Lyon seemed to be more in his element in this production than he was in GUYS AND DOLLS . Lyon's characterization improved 100% over his Sky Masterson . Lyon seemed more in character than in his previous role in the show .
 There was little chance for Bar to show the audience his fine voice on the fast Gilbert and Sullivan pieces .

 The chorus and orchestra left somewhat more to be desired then did the main characters . The main characters were played by the main character .
 The chorus held a consistent tempo and had good pitch but could have sung louder in places . The chorus was good enough, but it could have been louder than usual .
 Generally the chorus was convincing as ""Gentlemen of Japan"" in spite of some atrocious make-up and bungled movements .
 The orchestra seemed at times to be totally unaware of J Julius Baird's presence as the conductor .
 Sometimes this resulted in a syncopated rythm between instruments and singers, and sometimes in an orchestra . Sometimes the rythms of instruments and singing were syncoped . Sometimes this led to the creation of a syncoped orchestra .

 Mice have a pyramidal social [fracture] with one boss as the top, few middle-class straw-bosses jelow him, and below them a vast rde of common mice .
 The males have nothing to do nth the rearing of the young. [hat is a completely feminine [unction]. Male males are not responsible for rearing the young .
 Brown observed that when new groups are formed in his pens â e is continual strife for about hours as they decide who is the leader . aggressiveness, rather than size, usually is the most important factor in determining who becomes the leader, he said .
 "Those who lose the fight, but â scape with their lives become 'straw-bosses'" or peasants. Those who fail to win the fight become "straw bosses" or "peasant" or peasants .
 The 'straw-bosses"" like middle class aecutives, live in constant tur . Most of them are either on ;heir way up or on their way town,"" Brown said .
 He feeds them well with a purpose, for he is trying to determine how they spend the energy they take into their bodies . Their diet consists of a specially-prepared, nutritionally balanced pellet made specifically for He feeds .
 Energy is used for producing work, gaining weight, or is passed off as waste . Basically the energy is used to produce work, gain weight or to pass on waste .
 Brown noted that the mouse who is destined to become the chief of his clan may have a lower metabolism than other mice . Brown said the mouse's metabolism may be lower than that of other mice.
 He thinks this is because the potentially superior mouse has a more efficient body . He thinks that the mouse body is more efficient than the mouse's .
 He hopes to find out how much energy each mouse burns under various kinds of conditions . Each mouse has a unique body shape and energy capacity .
 A mouse is placed in a sealed chamber in which ordinary air is pumped at normal pressure . The oxygen consumed is measured by placing a mouse in the same chamber .

 Passion and fate cannot be outwitted, for it is under the stress of love that ""reason"" flounders, loses its validity, and becomes an incomprehensible phenomena, says the author .
 Maurice Maeterlinck wrote the play, Pelleas and Melisande . The play is based on the works of the same name .
 He imposed a web of symbolism on a romantic theme, but rose above Romanticism . The author rose above the literary movement, which often swoons in its own delight .
 Maeterlinck's tone and mood it creates alienate the action from time, and external events need not be relevant to appreciate the universality of the play .
 This other-world atmosphere offers a stubborn challenge to a prospective producer . However, it is a strong atmosphere that offers a strong challenge to producers .
 Maeterlinck utiliz ed the famous Paolo-Francesca narrative from The Divine Comedy . If you devotes close attention to the play, explicit parallels are visible .
 As Pelleas and Melisande opens the possibility of a disastrous love takes birth, and continually deepens until the final climax ia reached . The final climax is reached .
 Pelleas and his siBter-in-law, Melisande, are driven towards each other, and all consideration for his brother, Golaud, is ignored .
 Their common source of love and light is symbolized by the sea, but already the water is gloomy . The sea symbolizes a source of light and love for the couple .
 Pelleas envisons their destiny when he speaks of the storm that comes in at the end of each day . Presently the sea is calm, but the storm comes in each day. Presently it is calm .
 The play comes to its climax at ""Blind Man's Springs,"" where ""reason"" is shattered, clouds drift over the path of life, and living becomes a blind proposition .
 The defeat of Pelleas is final but not tragic, says Martin Samuel . The defeat is not tragic for the Welshman, says Samuel Samuel . Samuel Samuel was inspired by whimsical impulses .
 As the dramatic narrative concludes, Golaud, an iron man of great physical stature, and Melisande, a young girl that might ""give God lessons in innocence,"" are unable to save themselves from tragedy .
 Students watched gangs of Slocum Hall men punching, tackling, and o-ouging each other while trying to move a pregnant-looking white canvas ball across manure-laden fields . Last week students had the unusual opportunity ot watching gangs .
 The technical name of this new sport is ""pushball,"" latest attempt by intramural manager Jim Hanks to revive Slocum Hall athletic competition . Pushball is the latest attempt to revive the moribund athletic competition.
 The wild game, played by six men representing their respective wings, consists of moving the paunchy white ball toward the opponent's goal in an attempt to actually enter his goal, or cross his goal line and score two points .
 Theoretically, the sport has rules and referees; in actual practice, however, the law of the jungle prevails, especially in the immediate vicinity of the ball . Normally docile associates are suddenly transformed into rough-housing gorillas .
 The most successful maneuver has been to deploy half of the team in pushing the ball toward the goal while the other half pulls opponents from the ball . Successful teams have won by keeping the ball in the air, and on the ground .
 All strategy, however, must be reinforced by a hustling group that is willing to lose, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 The demanding game enervates even the best athletes â and these are few and far between in Slocum's intramural competition . The demands of the game are too much to bear for the best .

 CC's on-again, off-again baseball team sandwiched two weekend wins into an otherwise gloomy week of play . CC's baseball team has won two consecutive games this week .
 Tuesday the erratic nine alternated by dropping two to extremely strong Adams State . Tuesday's loss was the first time Adams State had dropped two games in a row .
 Friday's Mines game fell apart almost before it got started, both teams indulging themselves generously in errors . Both teams indulged themselves generously with errors .
 Mines accumulated 7 errors during the course of the game, but even here CC came in a close second .
 It soon became a question of who could take the most advantage of naturally weak fielding . It was also a question for the England team to take advantage of their weak fielding.
 The one bright spot in the CC effort was Don Jorgenson's brilliant pitching, as he held the admittedly somewhat inept Regis Raiders to one hit in the first game of a double bill .
 Tigers beat Tigers 4-0 at Tiger Stadium on Saturday night . Tigers had already won the game 4-1 in the first half .
 In the second game, junior Alex Yankovitch began for CC, but Coach Jerry Carle had to summon freshman Jeff Sauer . Sauer had to be summoned when the Raiders threatened to close a six-run gap .
 Strong pitching by reliever Sauer, combined with unusually good late-inning CC fielding, stemmed the tide of Regis' rally . The Tigers went on to triumph, 8-5, and the Tigers won the game 8-4 .
 Adams State battered a sloppy CC team mercilessly, exploiting a glaring pitching and fielding weakness . Tuesday proved to be less cheerful, as Adams State beat the CC team 7-2 .
 The Indians' ten-run drive was finally smothered as Carle again called on freshman Sauer . After sweeping through starter Don Jorgenson and reliever Alex Yankovitch in the disastrous fourth inning, the Indians' 10-run run was finally stopped .
 The Indians went on to suffocate CC, 120, holding Carle's nine to two hits . Carle was held to just two hits by the Indians .
 Chris Batley started what was to be an equally lopsided second game for the Tigers . Batley fell prey to an eight-run Indian massacre in the second inning .
 Adams State defeated by Adams State in their first match of the series . Tiger fielding tipped the balance in the match with a decisive helping hand from Indian flysnatching .
 After a fifth inning rally, CC finally succumbed to the Redskin horde, 16-7 . CC eventually succumbed to a fifth-inning rally .
 As the season has progressed, it has become painfully apparent that unless Carle's Tigers can balance an extremely lopsided pitching staff and eliminate fielding errors that have so far plagued the team, prospects are dismal indeed .
 The Tournament of Cycles was held in 1962 . It was the first time the event had been held in a public cycling event . It took place in the summer of that year .

 The third ' finisher, Glen Foust, slid on a fast turn, flew into the air and made a beautiful 4 point landing . He recovered quickly, suffering only from well-skinned shins and elbow .
 Bud Mixon forged into the lead in the home stretch after following the pack most of the route to snag first place . Mixon followed the pack in the race for the first time in his career .
 A last minute entry, Rob Pittaway, followed close behind Bud and finished second . The winner of the race was a last-minute competitor .
 Right behind Rob was Russ Sperry to grab a very respectable third place in a hard-fought race . Russ finished second in the race .
 The last race, for eight to fifteen speed bicycles, was undoubtedly the most interesting . It was for eight-to-15 speed bicycles .
 The field passed the starting line three times in the IVi mile course, and each time a different cyclist led the pack . The race finished at the top of the line on Sunday .
 Jerry Macon set a new course record with a blazing 7:12 for 2V 2 miles . Macon also set a course record for the first lap of the 2-mile race .
 In the final lap John Tarr took over the lead and kept it to cross the finish line in first place . Tarr crossed the line first place in the final laps .
 Second place was not decided until the last few yards of the final few yards, a few seconds later . Second place in the world was decided in the final seconds .
 Mark Stetson, last year's first place winner, took second by a wheel from Bruce Colvin . Last year's winner took second place in a wheel-race in his first place place in the world .
 Dan Martin caught a second wind and zoomed past Evan Heckel just at the finish line . The remaining entries were well strung out except for 8th finisher Dan Martin, who finished 8th .
 A special award went to Kathy Murphy for her resolute attempt . Kathy Murphy was the only female entry to complete the race .

 Mr Cassius De Flon's pro-eugenics letter in the Tiger of May gratulates the Tiger on raising the proportion of news it has consistently printed since the first few issues .
 It also gives me the opportunity to offer your readers some criticisms of the eugenics position, as none have appeared so far in your pages . It gives me a chance to offer some criticisms, but none so far so far .
 The version of his argument to which we were treated in the Roberts Lecture was eugenics at its most reckless, with none of the reservations added . It was 'eugenics' at its 'most reckless' with no reservations added, he says .
 The fallacy of the eugenics argument is that it makes deductions about human evolution from data derived solely from the biological sciences . Muller and De Flon present it as a fallacy . The fallacy is that the argument is based on data derived from purely biological data .
 Muller uses the terms ""culture"" and ""cultural evolution,"" he shows little awareness that human socio-cultural life is more complex than the existence of other animal species . Muller has little awareness of the complex nature of human life .
 On the face of it, the list of genetically ""good"" traits looks so desirable that to attack it would be like attacking mother-love .
 Anthropologists would be more enthusiastic about selection in favor of them if psychologists could tell us more about their dynamics . Geneticists can tell us about their genetic makeup, anthropologists say . But anthropologists would like to know more about the dynamics of selection .
 Muller fears that without selective breeding, human beings will eventually be able to 'prop up their own feebleness' Muller says that human beings 'will eventually do no more than . do nothing more thanÂ prop up themselves' Muller fears selective breeding will allow humans to 'do no more
 Some physical conditions are apparently being selected against by modern cultural conditions which were neutral before the industrial revolution, just an instant ago in evolutionary time . As I said on the 24th, this prediction ignores the fact that some physical conditions .
 It assumes that we have had accurate statistics on the incidence of specific diseases over long periods of time . It also assumes that the statistics are accurate and accurate .
 Phenylketonuria, for instance, is now well diagnosed now but was not always . Phenylkonuria is a form of kidney disease that causes kidney failure in some cases .
 One school of thought among physicians believes that the increase in statistics on this disease is an artifact of better diagnosis and better record-keeping .
 The definition and even the desirability of a healthy body are ""more parochial than the eugenists apparently suspect," says Dr. Andrew Hammond .
 In mid-twentieth century America we enjoy a cult of health, youth, and suppleness which is by no means shared in other parts of the world, not in Euro-American culture at other times .
 A modern physician might well regard one of Titian's or Rubens' models as overweight . Rubens, Titian and Titian models were likely to be overweight. Rubens was a painter of the 16th century .
 A Hottentot male wants a female with a pot belly, swayed back, and fantastic eccumulations of fat on the buttocks . A female with pot belly and swayed back .
 There is good evidence that in paleolithic times men were selected for keen senses, fleetness, and grace . In the neolithic sheer strength had better survival value .
 In eighteenth century Europe, the tendency toward tuberculosis was fashionable . The tendency to develop tuberculosis was also fashionable in Europe .
 Selection for the modern American concept of good health would violate norms of other times and other places . Selection would violate the norms of others times, and we have no guarantee that this concept will last longer than any other .
 Muller's and his even more inflammatory term ""genetic deterioration"" appear to ignore the problem of measurement . Muller's fear of Muller's, and his inflammatory term "geneticÂ deterioration" appear to be ignoring the problem .
 Evolutionary theory has no measure of genetic goodness except natural selection . If selection does not operate against a genetic factor, that factor can hardly be considered harmful . Selection is not necessary to be harmful, but it can be beneficial .
 Muller says cultural existence is an ""artificial"" way of life . Muller: Culture is an "artificialÂ way of life" Muller: "Culture is an artificial way to live"
 Culture is a survival device, a part of nature no more ""artificial"" than the hide of the rhinoceros or the claws of the lion . Culture is not a "survival device" but a "part of nature" that is no more "artificial"
 I shall not argue that the tendency toward disease is actually of use to our species, though such an argument might be made . Instead, I shall argue that such a thing might be useful to the human species .
 Mr De Flon seems to understand well enough the position of some geneticists on human genetics .
 A sound knowledge of Homo sapiens, however, requires that one take a broad view of human behavior . The interaction between genetics and culture is an intricate interaction, says author .
 The Deak U PEAKS was a liberal arts college nestled comfortably in the lush green valley where the sparkling River Styx wound its course .

 Cranfield Smartypants III studied every night, never caroused with the local wenches, maintained a 3.5 overall, and was very good . One of the best students in Cranfield, England, was Cranfield's Smartypant III .
 The other, whose name was Crazylegs Funandgoodtimes I, never studied, cut classes, lettered three vears in jousting, and was very bad. I was very good. I never studied and cut classes .
 Crazylegs was still in bed, having slept through Organic Alchemy, Fundamentals of Blood-Letting, and International Usury . One warm afternoon he was still asleep in bed .
 All of the closet door burst open and out stepped a dumpy little old lady, dressed in faded cheese cloth ami wearing an old St. Ami .
 She wore a St. Louis Browns baseball cap . She bore a sticking resemblance to Ma Kettle . She was wearing a baseball cap when she appeared .
 Crazylegs, being the shifty, rotten character that he was, did not feel it was his place to tell the dumpy litle old lady he was not Cranfield . He considei-ing the fact that there might be something in it for him .
 Crazylegs decided on a maroon Corvette a lifetime pass to the ale-house, and a 3.3 overall . CrazyLegs decided to buy the Corvette after a great deal of dickering .
 The real Cranfield stumbled into the hoom . He was so clumsy and made so much noise, that he startled the F.G.M. and she inadvertently turned him into a toad .

 The play, from a dramatic point of view, cannot in all fairin ^ often terr terrrt,i e to behold . However, the play is not all fair in all, and it is often not all funny .
 Hp _jss be dismissed with only a rewarding nod and a congratulatory smile . Hp_jss can be dismissed by only a smile and a nod from a colleague .
 "The play as a total unit had little or no continuity," reviewer says . "Each scene lacked the puissance to carry its action and its suspense over to the next"
 'They were disjointed almost without meaning', a chain of disorganized events; a dream. 'They're disjoint almost without meanings', a writer says .
 The use of gimmicks was an unsuccessful attempt to cover up for the poor acting of the players, says BBC Sportsmail . "The use ofÂ gimmicks was a failed attempt toÂ cover upÂ for the poorÂ actingÂ of the players," says BBC Sport's Simon
 'The music was excellent in itself, but it tried to create out of nothing something which did not exist' 'It was an attempt to create something which didn't exist,' says the reviewer .
 As it faded sporadically into the nervous silence of the auditorium, much of the mood and atmosphere of the play vanished along with it .
 The lighting was generally good, but it was not memorable or excellent . A few scenes such as the garden scenes or the one utilizing the King, Melisande, and her husband were noteworthy .
 The rest of the lighting was neither dramatic nor intense, and it helped to painfully illustrate the condition of the play . It helped to illustrate the play's condition .
 The settings, designed by Joan Carter, were the most outstanding, adding much to the atmosphere . The settings were designed by Joanne Carter .
 "They expressed with more precision than dialogue could do the tragedy and the forboding in the plot," the author says of the film . "They express more precision," he adds .
 The costumes were well chosen, flattering, and accurate . Except for anachronistic mop, the costumes were great .
 The last scene would fade into obscurity and the shuffling of scenery and impatient feet would be dispelled with the introduction of new activity . As it was, the last scene of the last scenes would fade .
 The activity itself was, in general, on the par of fraternity skits . It was matchless in its ability to embarrass the audience as a whole . The activity was 'matchless'
 Arkel the King, played by Jay_ Hemingway, was perhaps the most credible performance of the evening . The performance was a credible performance .
 Genevieve played by Margaret Neuman was flat and colorless, without life or feeling, but perhaps this was intentional . Perhaps this is intentional .
 Pelleas, portrayed by Carl Chard, ranted and strutted his hour upon the stage with little mc Â· Â· .
 The total effect was displacing the audience, but it seemed like it wasn't real .
 One cringed and squirmed with uneasiness and repulsion waiting in trepidation for the inevitable laughter to follow . But to see it enacted by this Pelleas one cringed, squirmed .
 As previously mentioned, his execution of Pelleas left something to be desired and was anything but effective .
 He too gave the impression that his Method acting had failed, creating an incomplete and self-conscious combination of Golaud-John Giannes .
 Ethel Six Geary's interpretation of Melisande was a far better attempt than most of the others . It was not a profound projection of high dramatic quality, but it was nevertheless a good attempt .
 There was even, at times, a true, sentiment, but it was soon lost in her flightiness .
 She acted throughout as the scapegoat for the audiences nervous laughter and derisive scorn . Nevertheless she did perform one function in that she acted throughout . Nevertheless, she was a scapegoat throughout the show .
 Three servants added a welcome relief with their light comments, and were enjoyed by most . Even if it was only a minor role, the three servants were a welcome addition to the cast .

 Rossiter then pointed out the dangers which can arise from having unreal or unrealizable ideals . Rossiter said the dangers of unreal ideals can arise when people have unreal or unrealistic ideals .
 Although ideals should be more advanced than the eality they describe, they should not be so advanced as to be imiractical, giving us a misleading onception of what our aims are in times of crisis .
 Calls this disparity between â deals and reality the ""ideal gap,"" he went on to declare that we should correct at least three errors that are handicapping our progress today .
 Dssiter declared that modern government demanded a greater sponsibility for our leaders and that with this responsibility must be corresponding political and personal power, still within the confines of democracy . Modern government demands a greater sponsorship of our leaders .

 We have seen two very stimulating and thought provoking letters appear in The Tiger . During the past two weeks, we have seen a very stimulating, thought provoking letter .
 Both pro and con arguments about artificial selection have been presented . Both pro or con arguments against artificial selection are presented .
 He has implied that good health is only a matter of fashion, geography, or culture . He has also implied that it is only matter of style, geography or culture.
 Mr De Flon bases his argument for artificial selection on the fact that there is a buildup of detrimental mutations occurring in mankind's genetic reservoir .
 These mutations result in the inability of the organism to carry out vital metabolic processes, or to resist disease . These mutations are known as 'mutation mutations' and 'mutations'
 Mr Kutsche bases his argument on the hope that culture will counteract the pernicious effect of mutations .
 The examples Mr Kutsche cites of control by culture are rather easily counteracted lethal or sublethal mutations . The examples he cites are of control of culture by culture .
 When the buildup of genetic defects has reached a certain point, humans will appear who carry a series of these defects, and control by medical means will become increasingly impossible . Control will become impossible by the end of the day .
 Def defects which are not now selected against due to cultural knowledge can readily be considered harmful . Thus, defects which were not now considered harmful can be readily considered harmful.
 A Hottentot male wants a female with a potbelly and a swayed back . He doesn't seem to realize that it is precisely because of natural selection that a female has a pot belly .
 It also does not follow that because people once felt that tuberculosis was fashionable, it is good health in a purely objective sense, it does not mean tuberculosis is fashionable .
 On a statistical basis alone, I would object to the feasibility of this undertaking . On the statistical basis, this is not a good idea for the project .
 There is also the fact that new deleterious mutations would arise in each successive generation . Some of these would not be detected for several generations until an appropriate mating resulting in a homogenote occurred .
 Until our knowledge of genetics has increased sufficiently to provide us with an exacting method of genetic analysis in vitro, rather than a phenotypic analysis in vivo, the reduction of deleterious mutations by artifiicial selection would be impractical .

 Bob Novig has been selected as Colorado College's Photographic editor for the 19G2-63 school year . Novig will be the Photographic Editor for the next year .
 Bill Stafford volved would be so severe as to render the project impossible . Henceforth, requests for photographs will be referred to him rather than Bill Stafford .
 If we then decide to select against it, we would have to stop most of the African population from breeding in areas where malaria had been at all prevalent in times past . We would then have to choose against it .
 "It would seem much more appropriate to talk in terms of what we do know than what we don't," he says .
 From even the most superficial study of genetics, one finds certain things that stand out . From even a superficial study, genetics can reveal certain things .
 All genetic structures exhibit a certain tendency to change, i.e. to mutate . Genetic structures have a tendency to do so, and mutate, say experts .
 This tendency might be called the base mutation rate for that organism . This tendency may be the "base mutation rate" of an organism .
