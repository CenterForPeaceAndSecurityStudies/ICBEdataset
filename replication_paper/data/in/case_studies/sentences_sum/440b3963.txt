 The Sixteen Known Nuclear Crises of the Cold War, 1946-1985" presents in detail the reality which many of us have either known or suspected during our nuclear age . The book is based on the 16 known known Cold War Crises .
 Nations with nuclear weapons will, as we know, threaten to use them, and as we also know, some circumstances, actually use them . Nations have nuclear weapons, as well as threatening to use, they will use them in some circumstances .
 Morgan establishes that we have approached that crisis, not once, but 16 times since the blasts that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 16 times . Morgan establishes, in fact, that that crisis has occurred 16 times in the last 16 years .
 Morgan documents the times the use of the bigger ones were threatened . Those were, as we now know, minor bombs . Morgan: This paper is an attempt to inform the public about the very dangerous nuclear crises of the Cold War .
 Until these are widely understood, the great dangers of present policies will not be questioned and discussed . Until now, the dangers of the present policies are not being questioned or discussed, they are not widely understood .
 The U.S. is the least secretive of all the world's great powers, with its Freedom of Information Act . The Freedom Of Information Act is one of the fewest secretive countries in the world .
 Much of the information in this paper has been made available by the benefit of this Act . Much of this paper was made available to the public by this Act.
 There are 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world in 1996 . The threat of the destruction of civilization by these weapons remains very great .
 The more that nuclear weapons increase military power, the more they decrease national security . The more nuclear weapons decrease military power than increase national security, experts say . Nuclear weapons are more likely to be used in the U.S.
 Only escape from this paradox is by the balanced reduction and eventual total abolition of these weapons on a rigid schedule . The only escape is by a balanced reduction .
 The U.S. tested the first H-Bomb in 1953 . A-Bomb was used during the Vietnam War . It was the first weapon developed by the United States .

 Soviets develop first MIRV for their ICBMs . India explodes A-bomb . USSR invades Afghanistan .

 This is a time similar to Period 3 of the Cold War . Post-Cold War was a period similar to period 3 .
 Morgan documents in considerable detail each of the 16 nuclear crises . Effective nuclear arms control is needed to avoid repetition of Period 4 with dire results .
 We have been fortunate in getting through all 16 of these crises without actually launching or stumbling into a nuclear war . This is just a taste of the total frightening menu. We have a total of 16 crises in the last 16 .
 1,400 Cuban exiles invaded Cuba at Playa Gir√≥n with United States support in 1961 . At issue in the crisis was the right of the U.S. to match Cuba's medium-range nuclear-missile threat .

 Le May, USAAF Chief of Staff tells Kennedy an attack is essential and that Soviets would not respond . Le May: "An attack on the Soviet Union would be essential" Le May was the first time the U.S. launched an attack on Soviet Union .

 The flat trajectory Pershing II missiles were extremely accurate and designed to ""decapitate" the Soviet leadership . They were designed to kill Soviet leaders in order to destroy their enemies .
