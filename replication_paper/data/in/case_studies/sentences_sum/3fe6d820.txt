 Russian President Vladimir Putin visited a beach in Turkey on the opposite shore of the Black Sea . He was acutely aware that there were American bases with nuclear warheads capable of wiping out Moscow in matter of minutes .
 Khrushchev's idea of placing missiles in a base close to the U.S. came to light . The idea was about then that an idea formed of placing them near the United States . The missiles would be placed in the base near a U.N. base .
 Short-and-medium-range missiles would, overnight, create parity with America’s long-range weapons . Obama's plan to place short and medium range missiles in U.S. backyard would overnight create parity .
 Cuba's geographical position has always made it very vulnerable to its enemies . Cuba’s geographical position makes it very difficult to defend .
 We were sure that the Americans would never reconcile themselves to the existence of Castro’s Cuba . We were also certain that the U.S. wouldn’t reconcile themselves with the reality of Cuba .
 "This question was constantly on my mind, and I frequently discussed it with the other members of the Presidium," says Zainain . This question was "constantly on my . mind," he says .
 It was during his visit to Bulgaria that he had the idea of installing missiles with nuclear warheads in Cuba . The Cuban president says he was impressed by the idea .
 No more weapons to Cuba and those within Cuba withdrawn or destroyed, and you respond by ending your blockade and also agree not to invade Cuba . Cuba must also end its blockade of Cuba and end its attacks on the island nation .

 You say it worries you because it lies at a distance of 90 miles from the United States . You say that it lies 90 miles away from the U.S. It's not the first time you've heard from such a nation .
 When I heard that, I imagine that Khrushchev knew it was the last thing I wanted to hear . When I . imagine that . I imagine . that, he imagine that he . knew that, it . was the . last thing he knew was that, "I imagine that
 That went against the theory the missiles had been sent to defend Cuba . It was thought the missiles were sent to the island nation .
 The sign in the picture is making reference to U.S. involvement in Cuba which, up until 1960, had been considerable . The sign is a reference to United States involvement in Cuban affairs .
 Until Castro’s takeover of Cuba the United States had a controlling influence in Cuba . Since his arrival in 1960 all United States businesses in Cuba had been nationalised without compensation . The U.S. broke off diplomatic relations with Havana and imposed a trade embargo in response to Castro�
 Cuba and the Soviet Union established relations in 1959 and signed trade agreements in 1960 . Both communist states had established relations with each other in 1959 .
 The cartoon was probably published to show how America was treating another communist country badly, and therefore generate sympathy for Cuba as well as hatred for America . The cartoon is likely to have generated sympathy for the Cuban people .
 Khrushchev decided to place nuclear weapons into Cuba on a visit to Bulgaria . Both agree that it was on a trip to Bulgaria that Khrushche decided to put them there .
 There is disagreement in the sources regarding Khrushchev’s main reason for putting missiles into Cuba . However, there is disagreement over the reasons for the move .
 Khrushchev thought the country was in danger from US attacks and only by moving weapons there would be able to protect it . Source C sees the reason as being to protect Cuba, with the country being in danger .
 The difference may well be explained by considering the provenance of the sources . The difference between the two sources may be explained .
 Source C is taken from Khrushchev’s own memoirs, and he may well want to appear defensive in tone . He explains the move of the missiles as protecting Cuba in his memoirs .
 Source B, written by a modern historian, sees it in a more provocative way . Source B sees the story in a provocative way. Source B is written by the modern historian .
 The influence of their rivals spreading is shown in the cartoon as the branches creeping into the gardens . The fact that both leaders are shown reading the books on pruning portrays that they were concerned over the influence this may well have .
 The cartoon is painted at the height of the Cold War and is reflecting the mood at the time . The cartoon was painted in the 1950s and 1960s .
 Cuba is the only small branch creeping into the American side, whereas the large branches of West Germany, Japan and Turkey are going into the USSR side . The message of the source is that Kennedy’s reaction to one small country is over the top, says the source .
 President Obama's second letter to the U.S. House of Representatives is similar in many respects to his first letter . He doesn't contradict himself, he just increases his demands in the second letter .
 In the first letter Khrushchev agrees to remove weapons from Cuba, he continues to make the offer . In the second letter, he offers to remove Cuba's weapons, showing consistency . The letter shows consistency .
 In the second letter he alludes to why these missiles are there, indicating he feels threatened by U.S. weapons in Turkey . In the first letter, he says the missiles are aimed at Turkey, not at Turkey .
 The offer to the Americans largely stays the same, but it's what he wants in return that changes . However, he's not necessarily lying in the first letter .
 It does show that Khrushchev’s motive was always Turkey and not Cuba, but it doesn’t show deceit, it doesn't show deceit . It shows that the motive was Turkey and Cuba, not Cuba . The U.S. State Department says it is investigating
 Khrushchev knew Castro would be angry once he knew of the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba . As the USSR and Cuba were both communist allies, Castro would have expected the USSR to support Cuba, not abandon them .
 Castro was willing to criticise an ally like this. I am a little surprised that Castro was able to criticize an ally . Castro was 'surprised' by the criticism of his ally .
 By 1992 the Soviet Empire had started to collapse, and the influence of Communism in Eastern Europe was declining . By 1992, the Soviet empire had begun to collapse and Eastern Europe had become a relatively peaceful region .
 Castro is willing to criticise Khrushchev because the USSR was no longer so important to Cuba . Therefore I am not surprised that Castro is not surprised he criticised the Soviet Union .
 Khrushchev said in Source C that ‘everyone agreed that America would not leave Cuba alone unless we did something’ The strongest source to support this view comes from Khruschev himself, who said he wanted to protect Cuba .
 President Obama may want to sound like he had Cuba’s interests, rather than forcing America out of Turkey, as his motivation . As these are his memoirs though, though he may .
 Khrushchev demands that America ‘agree not to invade Cuba’, showing that he is concerned for their safety . Source E echoes this point, saying that he was concerned for the safety of the Cuban people .
 Source A also indicates that this view is true, as it shows a Soviet cartoon trying to generate support for Cuba against America, showing that the USSR was genuinely concerned regarding Cuba’s safety .
 This shows how they were not as concerned for Cuba and that actually they’re only a bargaining chip, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: "This shows how ... they're only bargaining chips"
 Castro suggests that Cuba was only being used by the USSR to force America to withdraw weapons . This view is supported by Castro in Source G, who suggests that the USSR was only using Cuba to force the U.S. to withdraw its weapons .
 Castro’s reliability might be doubtful though, writing once relations between the USSR and Cuba were less important and the Soviet Empire had collapsed . Castro's reliability may be doubtful when relations between Cuba and the USSR was less important .
 Sources provide evidence that Khrushchev put missiles into Cuba to protect Cuba from the US . Overall, however, it isn’t convincing that the missiles were put in Cuba .
