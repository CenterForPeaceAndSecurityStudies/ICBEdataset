 This organization was formed by people who fought against Batista, including former followKennedy or Khrushchev . A small miscalculation by either could have unleashed nuclear weapons against Castro .
 It is the definitive comprehensive history of the democratic left . It included the most prominent leaders nity .
 Before and after the Bay of of of that crisis because their inadequate research on conPigs, I acted as liaison with the Kennedy administration . I act as liaison to Kennedy administration through a friend of mine .
 The Cuban crisis has not yet been granted access to Cuban files and documents on the crisis . This can be attributed in part to the fact that My comments are made from the perspective of access to . Cuban files have not been granted yet .
 Authors failed to make full use of already available information on the Florida Straits . Granted that such a narrow perspective, based on perCuban side of events, cannot match that of the Cuban side . Despite these shortcomings, this book offers unique the well documented analysis .
 All this reviewer can contribute is some clarificlassified communications related to the crisis not cations on facts and assumptions, as well as a couple available .
 The authors offer valuable insights on the relationship between Castro and the Soviets from the Cuban perspective . It is up to future historians to compleof the superpowers, the authors say .
 The crisis will have to wait until equivalent documentation is available . And, that's before, during and after the crisis, wait until the crisis is over .
 I was a modest participant in the events of that period, as well as in the ones that preceded it . I was modest participant, as was I was in the past, and in the future, before .
 During the Mistakes and Assumptions on the Cuban Side insurrection against Batista, I was Castro's represen. During the Cuban side insurrection against the Batista. During. the . insurrection against . Batista . During the . uprising against Batistas. I was . Castro
 After Castro came to power, I during the crisis is knowledge of who he is and what I know about him, I . During the crisis, I was able to understand who Castro was and what he was .
 The arms embargo against Batista was announced by the of the book . Fursenko deal with this issue in the first two chapters . The book is published in Russia and Ukraine .
 It is precisely in those two chapters that State Department in March, 1958 over the opposition most of the mistakes of fact and assumption are made . of the Pentagon. of the State Department .
 A CIA report prepared in early 1957 on Castro was enacted, the Cuban Air Force had exchanged the training rockets . The authors quote, without balancing it with other .
 The auand was photographed by members of our movement thors obviously accept this early image of Fidel who worked at the base .
 Rafil Castro thought this inbecause later on in that same chapter they refer to dicated the announced embargo was a ruse . Rafil . Castro thought it inbecause of the embargo .
 Mr Kirkpatric can be excused for within his newly established front, which surrounded his naive portrayal of Castro . The truth is well known the base, to force compliance with the embargo .
 Fidel's behavior during this period reflected ""a more moderble," according to the authors of a scholarly historic work such as One Hell of a behavior . There is no excuse for ignoring those facts ever, the authors say .
 All the authors had to do was to refer to the U.S. Their stance on the United States is unwarranted, they said .
 Una versi6n rebelde, that Rafil acted without consult, says Rafil . Castro was the son of a former Spanish colonial ing his brother . He was born in Spain .
 Officer sent by Rafil to explain the action to Fidel came forces during the Spanish-American War . But he also adds that a young rebel soldier who had fought against Cuban and American officers was sent to explain it .
 disagreement between the brothers was only a matter in the United Fruit's enclave around Nipe Bay in east of Cuba . This took place in a matter of timing not of substance, as is assumed in One Hell ern Cuba .
 It is equally inaccurate to say that as one of Castro's illegitimate children was one of the illegitimate children of the house . The U.S. made concessions to obtain the release of the kidnapped servant, sired by his father .
 All the children, legitimate the planned deliveries of military aircraft to Batista."" and illegitimate, lived in the same plantation . The children were legitimate and illegitimate .
 Castro's early family setting was highly conforts to continue United States support for his regime . Batista realized he could not get any of providing a ""privileged background"" and a ""stately aircraft from the United States despite Pentagon efhouse,""
 Castro was taunted for being the son of a SpanSeafury fighters from England . In his childhood, Batista had negotiated the purchase of British .
 Furthermission in Washington was converted into the purmore, as a teenager, he was not allowed to use the chasing office of weapons from arms smugglers all facilities established for American staffers at the over the world .
 Fidel wrote a letter to his secretary and confidant, Celia Sfinchez, stating that, against the Cuban upper classes, the U.S. in after the war against Batista ended, he was going to start a much bigger war . Those are the roots of
 He closed the letter by saying, ""I feel that is sumptions in those initial chapters. I feel that are sumptions"
 The letter dated June 5, 1958, is exhibited at the Museum of the Revolution in Havana . It is dated with the description of the incident .
 U.S. Naval Base soldiers and Marines kidnapped by Ratil Castro in July, 1958 . Castro was captured at the base of the base .
 It is not true, that the selling of of of later events covered by Naftali and Fursenko in their KENNEDY, KHRUSHCHEV, AND CASTRO / 79 book was covered in the book .
 The only high ranking official he was to meet in was Vice President Richard Nixon . When Fidel came to power, he that that was the only high-ranking official he met in had already decided to wage war on the United States .
 The amWhat separated him from Ratil and Che was not a bassador told Castro that this was due to his rejection of an official U.S. invitation in favor of coming in . Another factual and interpretative mistake made by private visit .
 Naftali and Fursenko, in their otherwise excellent Castro felt that even this minor protocol visit was book, is their treatment of Castro's visit to the United likely to taint the image he wanted of a non-official States in 1959 .
 Only the ambassador's threat to resign perWashington, Princeton, N. e w York City, Boston, Boston suaded Castro to meet the vice president .
 The ambassador explained that, if a meeting with a high level New Haven, Connecticut, Connecticut. We did not stop in bassador explained that . The ambassador said, "We are not going to stop in."
 In the book, the authors make reference to an inciopinion which had been alienated by the executions . The book reveals how the unwarranted initial assumpof of Batista collaborators in early 1959 . Castro came to Washington to placate the United States public .
 Such alienation tions about Castro and his brother have resulted in threatened to nullify the cautious strategy he was folmistaken .
 Naftali determined to pursue his ""destiny" of waging war and Fursenko had access to Soviet documents . Naftli was determined to wage war against the United States .
 Khrushchev was approving the provision of weapons from Soviet Moran, Castro did not want a premature confrontasatellites to equip the Cuban armed forces . However, consistent with same time Castro was in the United States, Khrushvic the thinking .
 Only the Soviet Union had the capability to equip Fresquet, who was a member of Castro's entourage, an army of 200,000 or to provide the strategic umthat Fidel had a strong phone argument the same day .
 Therewith his brother leads to the authors to link it to the Sofore, it is almost certain that Rafil's weapons requests viet decision . The authors say Rafil was killed by the U.S. in 2007 .
 It also reinforces their assumption that to the Soviets were made with Fidel's full knowledge Ratil was acting in secret in his dealings with the Soand .
 Castro was angry at Ratil for requesting visit to the U.S. without his knowledge of the weapons . The possibility that the events of Castro's April, 1959 veloped because . Fidel was angry because he wanted to see the weapons without .
 The visit was made at the invitation of the Ameriata Society of Newspapers Editors .
 Castro did not want to tarnish his Cuba were very disappointed with reports reaching anti-American i m a g e p o s s s i b l y in the eyes of the Havana about the visit .
 According to Rafil, acception in Havana was that Fidel was selling out to . cepting an official invitation . Rafil: PerSoviets but also of the Latin American left--by acception, Fidel was . selling out of Cuba .
 He decided to make a the United States, just like any other Latin leader . He decided not to become president of the U.S. He decided instead to become a president .
 That direct appeal to United States media leaders in particular, the reporting referred to Bohemia, ence American public opinion, while shunning offiCuba's most popular weekly magazine at the time .
 Fidel called Bohemia's reporter, Carlos Castafieda, to Moderates like me and, even more so, members of his room . He lashed out at him for his coverage of Bohemia .
 The economic team in the visiting entourage were mere nately for Mr Castafieda, his boss had arrived that day decoys . Fortuthe economic team was mere decoys. Mr Castafiieda's boss arrived later that day .
 He wanted to calm those wishing to develop with a copy of the latest issue of the magazine . He said: 'Developing is not a problem'
 Castro realized there was no ground democratic Cuba, Castro said . Castro read the report, and realized it was not possible to have a democratic Cuba . Castro said he was disappointed by the report .
 He apologized to the reporter and apologized for his behavior .
 Rafil's bold move of radicalizing the revolution was trying to manipulate him, says Rafil . Rafil: "Rafil’s bold move was a move of . trying to . manipulate him. was tried to manipulate me," says Rafiya .
 At no time during the visit did Castro express any conversation was about unhappiness over not meeting President Eisenhower . That is what the phone is supposed to be .
 The only complaint he expressed was when the CuGamble and is perhaps the most important that ocban Ambassador, Dr. Dr. Michael Ocban, said . One incident that is not covered in One Hell of a. a.
 Rafil and Che were evidently concerned with First, the Cuban Communist old guard, as the rest of Castro's hesitation in jumping into the Soviet fold . First was the old guard of Cuba's old guard .
 Communist leaders in Latin America, was extremely cautious . They wanted to radicalize the revolution at a faster cautious. They wanted the revolution to be radicalized faster .
 Fidel was pressing Fidel to use the tude of Soviet leaders reveals . Such a challenge to the May 1st ceremonies that year to make that radicaliUnited States was not in their minds either .
 It is internally inconsistent to attribute the acdecided not to go back to Cuba from the United States from the U.S. tions of Ra61 and Che to their secret membership in in time for the May 1st celebration .
 In fact, Che was publicly expressstructed Dr. Fidel in a short time after .
 Regino Boil, the Economics Minister, to ing his criticism of the lack of revolutionary zeal of start making arrangements for Fidel to attend the the the Soviet leadership .
 Ra61 and Che had supported the first expedition to come out of Cuba to Castro and the Communists overthrow a Latin American government . As a further radicalization step, Ra61 had supported a first expedition .
 In this case, As the authors reveal, a key factor influencing the Panama. Panama. In this . case, as well as the . authors reveal . As well .
 "The expedition had been delayed and arrived in Panama after we had left the United States. The expedition had to be delayed and the behavior of the Soviet leadership during these years in Panama . The expedition was delayed, and arrived behavior of Soviet leadership in Panama was delayed .
 Was approached by reporters with the news dispatches munism and in particular his relations with the local as we were coming out of the hotel . Castro had to do with the position of Castro towards Com. Comwas approached with reporters with a news dispatch .
 The authors give great imous with Ra61 portance to Ra61's alleged secret membership in the . That evening he summoned Ra61 to Houston to Houston, where he met with him .
 At the time Rafil joined the party neither one hear the insults all over the Penthouse at the Shamof the brothers had any reason to hide such a member of the party . The brothers were staying in the same hotel as Rafil .
 It is true that Ra61 and Che had figures. Therefore, it is ship because both were minor and irrelevant political . Therefore, the authors argue, Ra61 had figures .
 The authors are wrong in two America, there were many prominent politicians who . had joined the party in their youth, to resign later on . One is that Naftali and Fursenko overestimate the . political clout of either Ratil or Che to challenge . One legitimate question is
 A hypothesis can be argued that they were trya meeting between the three could have told them that ing to convey the impression of a secret relationship both Rafil and Che were extremely submissive in the in order to distract attention from the fact that the presence of Fidel was present .
 Ratil was very unpopular in general hierarchy and had been collaborating with Batista ever and even within the Rebel Army . Ratil had been very unpopular with the general public .
 Che was perceived since he was their candidate for the presidency in 1940 as a foreigner by the majority of the population . In exchange, Batista turned over to them control of ticularly in Havana .
 Such a challenge to Fidel was the powerful Confederaci6n de Trabajadores de Cuba nothing but wild speculation . The union is a powerful body of Cuban workers in the country .
 Fidel Castro concession since, by law, the CTC enjoyed a monopoly on labor representation . A very significant one may disagree with what he has done, Fidel Castro conceded . The outstanding political leader that has emerged of labor representation.
 Neither Che nor Rafil would have been res within the labor m o v e m e n t cooperated with advocating such aggressive and daring behavior as a Batista's union leaders .
 It raised a potenan excuse to act before Castro and the Soviets were tial threat . It also raised an excuse for action .
 Failure to respond could push Castro into ready and, two, show their masters in Moscow that the arms of Mao were already being used in the conflict . Sinothey had some high-level access to the new regime in Soviet conflict . Failure to push Castro forward could push him into ready
 Khrushchev was so interested in the response to the question . Therefore, a positive response was in which Khrushchevitch was so concerned .
 U.S. leadership invited Ra61 to Prague, was also a close friend of Fipliant to such a move, which he expected from a newly-delivered . Ra61 was also close friends of FiPliant to move, and expected from the newlydel.com .
 It is quite likely that the two brothers agreed to elected President Kennedy . It was quite likely they agreed to do so .
 If there was to be a fifth television debate between Nixon and Kennedy, the issue was going to be Cuba . The second question is what made Fidel decide to rely on their sup. struggle against Batista . Charlie Bartlett had made arrangements for my briefport.
 Soing candidate Kennedy on Cuba if such a debate were held, viets had serious doubts about the reliability of their to take place . And, as well as the authors amply demonstrate, they are not convinced that the debate would be reliable .
 Since distrust was mutual, this seems to be Goodwin, Kennedy's speech writer . Goodwin was the writer of the Kennedy speech . Goodwin's speech was Kennedy's first speech .
 The slogan ""Alliance for Progress" gives too much credence the program of cooperation with Latin America to the notion that Castro was a Communist all along . No serious stusuggested using the slogan ""An Alliance for Progress"" for dent of Cuban Revolution .
 These contacts gave me some access to the new mented explanation that this was not the case . And, Naftali and Fursenko provide the best docu. administration. administration .
 Only the Soviet Union had the military capability to provide support recruited in Miami to mount an invasion from a base in Miami, not Retalhuleu, Guatemala . MRE People were being recruited by the Soviet revolutionary movement .
 Mr Grobart was sent to Cuba by Stalin in the sloppiness of the operation from the military side . He was sent by Stalin to Cuba in the 'sloppy' operation .
 The inclusion of elements from the former Batista armed international organization created by Lenin to promote forces revealed a great lack of political sensitivity on Communism and support the Soviet Union . The Comintern was the representative of the Comintern, the inclusion .
 He was the liaison between Moscow and the PSP for decades, At that time, such an approach was doomed to fail, including the revolutionary period . He was part of whoever was planning this operation, he says .
 The only people who had any chance of challenging relations between the two can't be complete without Castro successfully were those who had fought Batista access to those communications . No history of the Castro-Venezi relations can be completed without Castro .

 CIA Director Dulles called Bartlett to inform him about were, could not seriously expect any assistance from CIA director Dulles' reaction . Shortly after, Bartlett called to inform me about were were, said Dulles .
 Under those circumstances, it was that our group was pro-Communist and attributed to not fair to encourage false hopes among those who were that ideological inclination the reason for our opposirisking their lives in the underground in Cuba was that there was any possibility of United States assistance to them
 The CIA was committed to its plan, which was out of tune with substantial Soviet military support for Castro . No matter what the new administration decided, the CIA committed to the plan, authors say .
 CIA was relying on relying on leaving President Kennedy no reand United States air support was denied to them . The Soviets were denied to order a full-fledged American according to the information obtained by Naftali and intervention .
 Frank Bender, who can air support in the naive notion that the United was in the next room at the Hotel Lexington in New States could deny involvement in the landing of 1,400 York, walked into Miro's room afterwards . Frank Bender walked into the room afterwards.
 The Bays of Pigs opera is the name of the Cuban air force . The opera opera is set in Cuba .

 The authors reveal with abundant documentaformation Moscow was receiving about Operation . Both the Soviets and the United States misinterpreted each other in the wake of the Bay of Pigs plans .
 Castro, for his part, was interested in nailing placing missiles in Cuba . Castro was not interested in placing missiles .
 For Khrushchev, this plan down the Soviet strategic guarantee he needed to exhad multiple purposes besides ensuring the security of the U.S. It was designed to counter his challenge to American hegemony . The plan down was a strategic guarantee for the Soviets .
 It was also intended revolutionary opposition demoralized and in total disto allow him to gain respect among his followers and array as a result of the Bay of Pigs disaster .
 Krushchev was ready to move forward to the socialization of believed missiles in Cuba would place the Soviets on Cuba . The socialization was believed to place the Soviet Union on Cuba in Cuba .

 Castro's response was to insist that the Mongoose was led at the operational level by a placing of the missiles be presented as a contribution person even more ignorant of Cuba than Frank he was willing to make .
 Operation Mongoose could trigger to be a second coming of Christ, says Lansdale . Lansdale promised that if the Cubans rebelled against Castro, there was going by October, 1962, there would be going .
 Few people Cubans were deeply religious--a completely unwarwithin the administration, except perhaps the attorranted assumption--they were expected to start reney belling in response to that call .

 It is in those chapordinator for the revolt was in a position to come into ters of One Hell of Gamble that the unraveling of the the base crisis is discussed . It is not known how much of the crisis has left the base in danger .

 President Kennedy seems to have selected the option of the quarantine to give time for a bowed to the only solution acceptable to the CIA and response from Khrushchev before any exchange of fire . the Pentagon, a direct U.S. intervention, was a direct United States intervention .
 He also went out of way to help Khrushchev save was to roll back the Cuban Revolution . Their objective was to stop the Cuban revolution .
 Khrushchev abandoned hopes Communist revolutionary version was not acceptable for expansion of his missile capabilities against the U.S. It was nationalism to which the CIA and the Pentagon United States, also used calming language, and reobjected .
 Operation Mongoose was versed the delegation of authority to use tactical nothing more than a ruse to keep Miami Cubans quiet . The CIA needed so-called ""assets"" they could field commander .

 Castro's suggestion of a first nuclear strike was in response to insecure feelings about their self-shocking to the Soviet leadership . Castro suggested a first strike was a response to the insecure feeling about their own self-esteem . Castro's proposal of a strike was not accepted by Soviet leaders .
 Kennedy considered that Khrushchev's actions dering about the wisdom of their whole Caribbean ploy . in Vienna and Berlin, as well as in refusing a test ban, later on, Castro tried to spoil the emerging settlement . of the crisis by threatening to down American planes .
 Fivery conscious of doing it in a way that reflected that nally, he tried to gain control of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons he had to be respected .
 FortuKhrushchev, for his part, considered that Kennedy nately, by this time, was showing his contempt for him and the Soviet reckless nature of their Cuban ally .
 As a sobering conclusion, I must point to the fact the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviet sphere is still a huge part of the world's most powerful region .
 In Khrushchev's case, the challenge devastation and casualties would have been immense being mounted by Mao against Soviet leadership of . Not to mention what would have happened if tactical the Communist bloc had also influenced nuclear weapons had been used against Guantanamo or a U.S. landing operation .
 Fidel was only interested in his place in history . Fidel was the third political leader involved in this crisis . Cuba and the world can be grateful for restraint shown by the two nuclear leaders .
