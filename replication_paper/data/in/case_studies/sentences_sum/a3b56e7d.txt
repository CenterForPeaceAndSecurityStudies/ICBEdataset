 There is now more data available on high-level decisionmaking considerations in this crisis than for any other . For the first time, inside information on Soviet and Cuban decisions is now available . Many of these data emerged only in the last two years, some in the past month .
 The most authoritative current interpretations are inadequate, mistaken or dangerously misleading, in particular misunderstanding and underestimating the risk both of non-nuclear and of nuclear war . Because of the nuclear power plant executives, nuclear power plants are still dominated by the foreign policy .

 A former Secretary of Defense has espoused what amounts to a concise statement of ""the new way of thinking" as his own proposals . That this is not impossible (it is certainly not automatic, nor even likely short of major political effort) is shown .
 McNamara urged a code for an international peacekeeping organization that would provide that political interests be pursued through diplomacy, not military threats or use of force . McNamara also urged that superpowers refrain from intervening in regional conflicts .
 We came as close to superpower armed conflict and possible nuclear launches that year, I believe, as Three .ile Island or Chernobyl came to a core meltdown of a nuclear reactor . Both U.S. and Soviet leaderships already felt strongly deterred from nuclear .
 Experts are closer to each other than ever imagined possible, or in this case, than most experts yet perceive . This is far closer than experts had imagined possible .
 Defense and foreign policy experts underestimate risks in other nuclear crises, he says . He says they underestimate the lesser but significant risks in past and future nuclear crises .
 On the preceding page he estimates that the risk of nuclear catastrophe in Cuba may have been ""one in one hundred" 4 two years later—most of the findings from which have not yet become available to other analysts—and on my subsequent experience and study of escalation in Vietnam, as well
 I went into that crisis as a specialist in nuclear war planning . I had drafted the Kennedy Administration’s top secret guidance for the general nuclear war plans that became operational that year .
 I came out of the crisis feeling I had experienced the most likely way a thermonuclear war would come to pass, if it ever did . I came to the conclusion that a nuclear war was most likely to come to an end if it did .
 "The way in which the plans and procedures I had studied and helped design might actually come to be acted out. The way in . which the . plans and . procedures I . had studied, helped design, might come to . play out .
 A dress rehearsal for nuclear catastrophe, on the scale of a million Hiroshimas . A dress-reaction for nuclear disaster on the way to the world's largest nuclear reactor .
 I determined to study that episode, and any others like it, with the best official access to information that could be achieved, to discover the faults in a system that had let us come this far along the path to a war that, surely, neither side had earlier intended or desired .
 This does not mean that I set out to examine this incident -when I had found sponsorship for such a study within the government a year later—with the presupposition that nuclear war had been very close, highly probable, or missed by a very narrow margin .
 I had believed during the height of the crisis that the actual probability of a major war, let alone a nuclear war, erupting momentarily was extremely low . On the contrary, he had believed that the real probability of such a war erupting was very low .
 As the blockade had tightened on Cuba, I thought Khrushchev, vastly outgunned both in the Caribbean and in strategic nuclear arms, had to back down . I thought then—like certain ""hawks” then and now—that Khruschev, like certain ""hawk�
 "I came to feel I had been very mistaken. Looking back just a few years latei after studying crises including this one, then participating in several that took us to war," he says .
 In 1964 I spent over six months studying this and other nuclear crises with interdepartmental access to highly-classified 5 information . The information was then virtually unprecedented and may still be so today . In 1964, the information was virtually unprecedented .
 A sponsoring committee of officials at the deputy secretary level in State, Defense, CIA, CIA and the Staff Directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assured me access to closely—held documentation in each of their respective agencies .
 As I put together information some of the highest officials had not known at the time and no one had seen whole before, it began to be clear that the overall chance of the military equivalent of a nuclear ""meltdown" without being close to certain or even as likely as not had
 The Ouemoy Crisis of 1957 was not commonly regarded by the public or scholars to have been a nuclear crisis . To my surprise, I discovered this inference of a near miss to be comparably strong in the case of at least one earlier episode, the Ouamoy Crisis .
 The potential danger in Cuba or Quemoy was not peculiar to the particular personalities involved, nor their strategic context . 1 found patterns and phenomena of decisionmaking in crises, not all of which had a nuclear dimension, 1 found .
 As a highest-1 eve 1 civil servant, he was a Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense observing, by participating in, the secret escalation of U.S. intervention in Vietnam in Vietnam .

 Moscow radio began broadcasting Khrushchev's acceptance of John F Kennedy's proposal to remove all offensive missiles from Cuba . In return for nothing more than a conditional American pledge not to invade the island . 25 years ago this week, the Moscow radio broadcast began broadcasting the announcement .
 The Cuban missile crisis was ended by Mr Khrushchev as abruptly, and for American officials as unexpectedly, as it began . The crisis ended abruptly and unexpectedly .
 Khrushchev’s concession to American terms on OcL 28, 1962, is inexplicable . For the last quarter of a century, American analysts of the crisis have found the suddenness of the . crisis . U.S. analysts find the suddenity of Mr Khrush
 The crisis provides an example of how the superpowers can be placed at the mercy of third parties, says Peter Bergen .

 I learned about one of them from Robert F Kennedy in 1664 while studying communications between governments in nuclear crises . He learned about the communication between governments and nuclear crises in 1666 .
 Mr Kennedy said he impressed the Ambassador the serious implications of the atucks that day on American reconnaissance aircraft . Mr Kennedy says he impressed cm the Ambassador .
 Cuban antiaircraft artillery had begun firing Saturday morning at low-flying planes, damaging at least one . Cuban anti-aircraft artillery began firing at the planes around midnight Saturday .
 A surface-to-air missile, presumed to be controlled by Soviet forces, had shot down a U-2 aircraft from an altitude higher than the artillery could reach, causing the first fatality of the crisis . The incident occurred during the Second World War II .
 Both types of firing were interpreted, without doubts, as a deliberate escalation, a change of orders by Mr Khrushchev . So both types of fire were interpreted as deliberate escalation .
 The firing of the surfaceto-air missile that destroyed the U-2 "was done absolutely without the direction of Khrushchev and the Soviet high command," he said .
 Robert Kennedy's mission Saturday evening was to induce Mr Khrushchev to recognize the dangers of what Washington interpreted as his decision to escalate and to get him to refrain from further attacks on reconnaissance planes .
 The Ocl 27 White House transcript reveals that it conveyed accurately to the Russians the consensus of the White House discussions that afternoon . The transcript also reveals that the Russians received the consensus that the Obama administration had agreed to meet with the Russians .
 The warning almost surely had more impact than was intended, for a reason the President and his advisers did not know about and failed to discuss even as a possibility . But the warning almost certainly had more . impact than . intended . The transcript shows the transcript shows that the President had failed to
 Khrushchev by this point hqd no influence over the Cuban antiaircraft artillerymen who threatened low-flying flights .
 Fidel Castro was determined to defend the sovereignty of Cuban air space regardless of Soviet desires to avoid provoking American retaliation . They had begun firing on Saturday morning on the orders of Fidel Castro .
 Khrushchev could only have concluded that he was on the way to losing both his nuclear missiles and surface-to-air missiles, with heavy Soviet casualties .
 A Cuban finger was on the button. If there was any way to avert this, it could only be to announce his acceptance of President Kennedy’s Saturday night proposal and to start dismantling missiles before a shoot-down .
 The race to the radio station with the Soviet announcement, which bypassed even slower diplomatic channels, came a few hours later . The dismantling began at 5 A M.
 The leaders of the two superpowers unwittingly contrived to put a trigger to World War III in the hands of Fidel Castro . Fidel Castro was the leader of Cuba and the Soviet Union in Cuba .
 President Kennedy's estimate of the odds of it erupting into general war — ""between one in three and even"" — does not seem too high . President Kennedy estimate during the crisis of the crisis was between 1 in 3 and even .
 Khrushchev paid a heavy political price for withdrawing so abruptly from what he had discovered to be Cuban roulette .
 Since this essay was published, a number of Soviet officials have added their voices to Burlatsky's, confirming Khrushchev’s lack of control of his own antiaircraft . The warning scent drifts on the wind today, this time from the direction of the Persian
 Khrushchev had no more practical control over the gunners and missilemen firing from Cuba at American planes on Saturday, October 27, 1962 than Gorbachev had over the Chernobyl reactor crew .
 It is almost painful, or frightening, to read this account in the present awareness that it was not by Khrushchev's orders or desires that Major Anderson had been attacked .
 Kennedy’s warning had been misdirected, as was his planned response to the next attacks . Kennedy's warning was misdirected and his response to next attacks was not what he planned .
 Cuban was threatening to kill Russians--at surface-to-air missile sites, and possibly at nuclear missile sites--if and when Cubans —under Cuban, not Soviet command--shot down another recon plane . Without realizing it, he was threatening, and planning, to kill Russia--

 The 25th anniversary of the crisis stimulated unprecedented symposia of former U.S. and Soviet officials . In particular, the coincidence of the onset of Soviet glasnos t and the 25th . anniversary stimulated unprecedented . symposias .
 Public television series, Freedom of Information Act requests, and significant memoirs have resulted in a flood of significant new data just in the last two years .
 All this has reawakened intense scholarly interest, controversy and creativity and creativity, says Dr. Andrew Hammond .
 Earlier research grants over the past several years have permitted me to benefit from reading nearly all of this material, which has reshaped many aspects of my understanding of the crisis .
 A great deal of the data made available to me in 1964 has still not publicly been released, 3, 3 and that almost all current analyses and inferences published about the crisis suffer significantly from this lack of data .
 I plan to spend at least the next six months doing this, with articles, research memoranda and a book as the eventual product . I will spend the rest of the time working on a book .
 Fortunately, I have not lost my own notes, from 1964, on Nitze’s notes, nor on the other study in question . Fortunately, he has not lost his own complete notes from 1964 and 1964 .
 The argument in the Op-Ed essay reproduced above is one example of this . Khrushchev ended the crisis so abruptly on American terms .
 U.S. contribution to the making of a crisis, on which all published accounts, up through the latest ones, agree . This has not occurred wit h respect to the United States contribution to making of the crisis, he says .
 All scholars have concluded — though with some puzzlement — that in the eyes of participants no ""decision"" seemed necessary or was consciously made on the issue .
 The ""intolerable"" nature of the secret Soviet deployment, hence the appropriateness of using all necessary military means to remove them, is reported to have been immediately self-evident and unproblematic to all American officials involved .
 Blight and Welch summarize a number of recent interviews with participants and joint discussions among former officials and scholars in terms which which fully accord with every other published account over the last quarter-century .
 The policymakers, Blight and Welch report, ""it appears to never seriously debated the issue," they say . The policymakers "never seriously debated" the issue .
 For them, it was simply axiomatic that the missiles could not be tolerated . For them they were simply axedomatic that they were not tolerated .
 Blight and Welch make clear their understanding, shared by all analysts, that the President’s reaction to the news was not determinative of the others’ but merely characteristic, a common judgment independently arrived at by every other official involved in the investigation .
 The American contribution to the existence of the crisis, its perception as a ""national security crisis"" legitimating and requiring a military response, is not attributed to the President himself .
 President Kennedy, as it turned out, was not told of the photographs and their import by McGeorge Bundy till 8 AM Tuesday morning Tuesday morning, October 16 .
 Nearly every official present at that meeting had been told the news on the evening before, October 15 . The news had been made public the night before .
 There is not one line in the literature, reflecting interviews and memoirs, that describes the initial judgement of a single one of these men that first evening as to what the United States should or should not do . Curiously, although various accounts of the crisis have described the exact circumstances under
 No evidence has ever been published, and none seems to have been probed for, as to what any of these officials thought, or what they thought, in the 15 hours or so before they heard the President’s view of the situation .
 It happens that my own interviews of several officials in 1964 did bear on this point, as does my copy of Paul Nitze’s notes on ExComm meetings . The ExComm meeting was held in 1964 .
 These data are in considerable contrast to the longstanding consensual account. These data, however, are in stark contrast to that of the previous account .
 Secretary of State Rusk was not the only cab i net i net -1 eve 1 officer whose first response--1ike Nitze’s--was that the missiles would have to be accepted .
 Secretary of Defense McNamara carried that attitude into the first meeting . He continued to argue for it in subsequent meetings, even after the President had expressed his contrary view .
 He lays out an approach he presented to the President the day before, which does accept indefinitely the continued presence in Cuba of the missiles already there, while taking steps to prevent their being increased in number .
 McNamara launched his famous advocacy of a blockade, it was not to meet a goal of eventually eliminating the missiles that had just been discovered but simply to prevent further introduction of missiles into Cuba .
 His proposal, to which he returned several times, presumed that the missiles already there would be allowed to remain . His proposal was rejected several times .
 He proposed aerial surveillance of the missiles already deployed, to be continued indefinitely into the future . The U.S. would respond not only against the missiles in Cuba but against the Soviet Union .
 The real purpose of the ”little package” he had outlined, McNamara explained, was to deal with the ""domestic political problem"" by fulfilling minimally the ""action requirement” in the President’s September 13 statement .
 "We want to prevent their use, which we would do by the surveillance and warning. Well, we want to stop their use," she said . "We would do that by monitoring and warning," she added .
 The next day McNamara followed his reiteration of his b1ockade-andsurveillance package with a ""Variant" of his "bockade" package .
 McNamara’s ""variant” dropped the blockade, limiting United States actions to aerial and electronic surveillance, with offensive action only in the event that the United States believed actual missile attack was imminent from Cuba .
 Bundy says he and "most others” agreed, that it made no difference at all to the strategic balance . Such a proposition was consistent with McNamara’s repeated judgment, Bundy says . Bundy: "It had no strategic impact on the security of the US, if missiles
 Nitze’s notes are from the same page of the October 17 meeting . Nitze's notes were taken from a page of his notes from that meeting .
 This thought is offered by the only military man on the ExComm, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . This thought was offered by President Barack Obama .
 President’s own role in defining the situation as a ""crisis,"" on his possible reasons for doing so, including the personal psychological and domestic political pressures that impact specifically on the President rather than on his chief officials . All these previously-unreported attitudes focus new attention on
 Kennedy was neither yielding to nor expressing a clear consensus among ExComm members . In his own initial bent to military action and his determination that the missiles already in Cuba could not be allowed to remain, Kennedy was not in agreement with the majority .
 Responsibility for the risks involved in subsequent actions is much more than a formal sense of responsibility . The risks involved are much greater than formal sense, with responsibility for his actions .
 My aim, now as then, is to understand events that are not only accurate but rel evant to policymaking in ways that could help reduce the risk of nuclear war . My aim is now as far as then to understand the events that led to nuclear war, he says .
 I was drawn back to this episode early in 1989 because it was newly apparent that such an understanding is within reach . The episode was re-imagined in 1989 for the first time in a decade .
 Since then, even more information has become available, by declassification and in meetings with former officials and analysts in Moscow and Havana . Even more information is now available .
 The immediate issue is whether to maintain U.S. and German short-range nuclear missile forces in West Germany . The issue would be whether to reduce or eliminate them, or to reduce them .
 The Soviets had recently proposed mutual elimination of both SNF and nuclear artillery in Europe, and this is supported by 90% of the German public . A large majority of all parties-elimmation of such weapons and perhaps of all nuclear weapons from the continent of Europe had become by mid
 The single legitimating rationale for NATO nuclear first-use policies will have disappeared . Gorbachev’s present policies, within a few years, will disappear, he says .
 This d o es not mean that U.S. tactical nucl ear weapon s_w ill ill_ au t omatical l v be withdrawn . It is a consequence of the loss of their rationale .
 The removal of nuclear weapons and the rejection of first-use doctrine in Europe appears political p oss ib 1 e in a way that has not been true for almost forty years .
 This removal would open the way to the rejection of nuclear first-use policies worldwide, and to truly radical mutual reductions in tactical and strategic nuclear stockpiles . This removal, in turn, would lead to nuclear first use policies being rejected worldwide .
 Nuclear weapons would reduce the risk of nuclear war erupting in an unpremeditated manner from a future crisis . And its immediate effect in Europe would be a lasting reduction in the risk, he says .
 Bush Administration and Thatcher Government have made it one of their highest foreign policy priorities to avert elimination of nuclear weapons from Europe . They want to postpone as long as possible even the start of negotiations .
 "To override this inertial resistance in the U.S. Executive Branch, I believe, will require a considerable reconstitution of the antinuclear educational and lobbying effort of the early Eighties," he says .
 The urgency of seizing the present unprecedented opportunity to rid Europe of nuclear weapons is not certain to happen without better understanding than is common among activists .
 Bush and NATO Commanders are right, too, to believe that the short-range land-based nuclear weapons are effective first-use threats .
 These weapons are more likely to be launched in West Germany than any other element in NATO's NATO panoply of tactical or strategic nuclear weapons . West Germany is home to the most of NATO's nuclear weapons in the world, writes Peter Bergen .
 The main reason for this for this greater likelihood of detonation is not one that Bush or NATO officials care to discuss openly . Bush and NATO officials don't want to discuss this openly .
 The American public has never heard it officially and might, at first, find it hard to take seriously . The U.S. public might, in fact, find this hard to believe .
 Most people would be reluctant to believe that responsible officials could have adopted and maintained an approach so iundamenta11y reckless . Most people are reluctant to think responsible officials would have adopted such an approach .
 "An informed understanding of the real ""deterrent functioning of these particular weapons is long overdue," says author . An informed understanding is needed for the public and for most specialists .
 Crucial to the analogy are several of the most striking revelations of the last two years . Crucial is the fact that the government has been in touch with the world's most powerful institutions .
 Khrushchev wanted to avert an invasion of Cuba by deterring it, analysts say . U.S. analysts now believe Khrushchchev's decision to deploy missiles secretly to Cuba was his desire to avert it .
 Documents reveal U.S. contingency planning for a fall invasion of Cuba throughout 1962 . Their implications for the crisis are only beginning to be explored .
 He sought to deter non-nuclear attack by threatening local first-use of nuclear weapons in response . He also threatened local first use of nuclear arms in response to an attack on non-military targets .
 Kennedy told Putin that if he fired a missile from Cuba the U.S. would treat that as a missile directed from the Kremlin, and retaliate accordingly . After all, he didn’t need to be told -- though Kennedy went ahead and told him anyway .
 To initiate nuclear attacks on the U.S. would be potentially suicidal for Khrushchev, he says . To initiate a nuclear attack on the United States would be a 'suicide' for the Soviet leader .
 Their main fear was that their attack might trigger the launch of a Soviet nuclear missile without an intervening order from Khrushchev . The main fear of the attack was that it might trigger a Soviet missile launch without intervention from the Kremlin . The attack was thought to be the first since the Soviet
 A third significant revelation in the last two years—based on recent testimony by McNamara, confirmed by ExComm transcripts -- is that he took very seriously the possibility that a mediumrange missile would be launched against the United States in the event of a non-nuclear air or ground attack against
 His fear was not so much that General Secretary Khrushchev would deliberately order missiles to be fired, under any circumstances . But his fear is not so many as that he would deliberately fire a missile .
 McNamara has emphasized that what worried him was the possible action of a ‘’Soviet second lieutenant” in Cuba acting without order s to launch a missile in the heat of an American attack on his own unit .
 The probability of such an event as ’’�very low...maybe one in fifty” that prospect was enough, in his own mi nd--and he felt sure that President Kennedy agreed —to preclude the choice of an air strike or invasion .
 The crisis could not be excluded from the earliest days of the crisis, it has been said . And that possibility could be seen from the early days of this year's crisis .
 Medium-range missiles in Cuba deterred nonnuclear attack on Cuba . Those missiles were stationed in the potential combat zone . In a way that comparable numbers of ICBMs in the Soviet Union would not have deterred attack .
 In effect, McNamara feared Khrushchev’s possible loss of control over these weapons under conditions of combat in Cuba . McNamara: “In effect, the U.S. wanted to avoid losing control of these weapons .
 Khrushchev feared he could not reliably prevent the possible firing of a missile stationed in Cuba . The fear was a fear that the U.S. would not be able to prevent the firing of such a missile in Cuba in the event of a nonnuclear attack .
 McNamara had good reason to know the limits on his own practical control of personnel and weapons, even in the nuclear sphere . By that time in his career, Secretary of Defense McNamara knew the limits of his own personal control .
 The image of Soviet command relationships among specialists in those days portrayed obsessive centralised control, iron discipline, and Godlike authority . Some Soviet experts would have disputed him .
 A U-2 was shot down by a Soviet SAM on the climactic Saturday of the crisis, that a Soviet officer had taken first blood without authorization from Khrushchev, indeed against his wishes .
 Khrushchev had been unable to prevent his Third World ally Fidel Castro from risking the survival of the Soviet Union by firing at American planes . Castro had also risked the survival .
 McNamara’s apprehension about the possible "i n i n i t i at i ve" of a Soviet nuclear missile officer in Cuba was not misplaced . McNamara was concerned about the possibility of a nuclear missile in Cuba .
 McNamara had known at the time the extent of which control of non-nuclear operations had slipped away from civilian leaders on both sides .
 A Soviet subordinate did do with a surface-to-air missile in the presence over Cuba of a high-flying U-2 reconnaissance plane, Saturday morning October 27 . What he feared a junior officer might do was what a Soviet subordinate might do .
 The threat depended essentially on the ground-based ""forward"" location of the weapons, where their crews would inevitably come under direct attack, or fear it imminently .
 Khrushchev sent medium-range missiles to Cuba and short-range nuclear missile forces . Short-range missile forces and nuclear artillery have been stationed in Europe since the mid-Fifties .
 To be sure, the analogy is even closer to Pershing II and cruise missiles that were recently removed from Germany under the INF agreement .
 It is not the range of the weapon that is functionally essential, but its location--in a potential combat zone--is critical . The weapon is vulnerable to attack or capture and to a ""use it or lose it"" mentality among its local commanders .
 Any use of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, whether authorized or not, is highly likely to lead to the launching of longer-range weapons that can hit the Soviet Union . After all, any use in Europe is highly unlikely to lead in short order to the launch of long-
 U.S. ground troops in Europe are a tripwire for the SNF that accompany them . SNF are a "tripwire for strategic weapons, just as the United States ground troops are in Europe"
 The strategy Khrushchev chose in 1962 to deter invasion of Cuba was the strategy that the U.S. pressed on NATO in the midFifties . The strategy was the same strategy the United States pressed on in the 1950s to deter Soviet invasion of West Germany and Western Europe
 President Bush is pressing Chancellor Kohl to maintain and ""modernize" the strategy . President Bush wants the strategy to be maintained by the German Chancellor .
 Khrushchev’s ""defense"" of Cuba is key to understanding the NATO strategy, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen: We can better understand the specifics of NATO strategy in the light of Khrushchev's 'defense'
 It is a strategy of deterring non-nuclear attack on an ally or client by threatening to initiate tactical nuclear warfare . The U.S. threatened to initiate nuclear warfare in response to an attack on its ally .
 An additional element is to accompany the weapons with sizeable numbers of one's own troops in the ally’s territory, to make it still more plausible that either the national authorities or local commanders will use the tactical nuclear weapons to ""protect"" these national units .
 Under conditions of nuclear parity, that implicit threat can be far more credible than the most explicit commitment that national authorities will deliberately initiate first-use . The implicit threat is far more likely to be credible than that of national authorities, experts say .
 It was the one time when the commanders of one superpower were poised for and actively contemplating imminent attack on part of the nuclear forces of the other . The one time they were actively contemplating an attack on each other's nuclear forces .
 The Soviets’ implicit threat of unauthorized action operated strongly on the mind of the opposing Commander-in-Chief and his second in command, according to the latter’s direct testimony . Khrushchev had ever consciously intended such a threat or not, he says .
 There can be little doubt, to be short about it, that the short-range nuclear missiles and nuclear artillery on both sides of the borders in Europe--along with forward-based aircraft-- are just as effectively deterrents .
 The often-cited notion that a President in Washington would be much more willing to order such weapons launched, because he hoped to keep the resulting two-sided nuclear war limited within the borders of Germany is at most a small and imp>lausible part of that reason .
 In face of overwhelming attack some of the weapons would be fired because local commanders would fire them, from a variety of motives . What is far more plausible is that some of these forward-based weapons would not be fired .
 No other elements of either side’s nuclear posture are remotely so credible for first-use . In fact, given the nuclear stand-off between the two Pacts, no other elements are remotely credible .
 Not carrier aircraft or cruise missiles . certainly not submarines or homebased missiles or bombers . Not carrier . aircraft, cruise missiles; certainly not submarine aircraft .
 Ground-based short-range nuclear forces are essential to the effective credibility of a strategy relying on threats of initiating and, if necessary, escalating nuclear warfare . One could well conclude that these vulnerable, ground-based . forces .
 All of these levels of command are subject to non-nuclear attack in the earliest minutes or hours of actual conflict, and subject to being overrun in hours or days . All of the command posts are under attack in minutes of any actual conflict .
 Anyone attacking them would be right to worry about nuclear detonations, author says . Anyone attacking the U.S. would also worry about a nuclear detonation, he says .
 The test of crisis stability under near-combat conditions demonstrates both sides of the issues raised by the short-range nuclear weapons in Europe . That dress rehearsal for superpower war, that field test, is a field test for stability .
 Since November 9, 1989, the likelihood of a Warsaw Pact offensive into West Europe spearheaded by Soviet tanks has come to seem virtually impossible, so long as Gorbachev’s present policies prevail . Of course, since November 9 .
 The still highly-armed neighborhood of West and East Germany is not totally ruled out of armed conflict . But that does not mean that armed conflict in the still heavily-armed area is totally out of the long run .
 Conflict in East Europe is, if anything, more likely than before before, with the possibility of expansion and spillover . Civil war in Rumania, and the resurgence of territorial and ethnic disputes in the Balkans and elsewhere, is more likely now than before .
 Direct involvement of Soviet troops in such a conflict would almost surely require a successor to Gorbachev in power . The Soviet Union would almost certainly need to intervene in the conflict .
 French foreign minister last month proposed the possibility of armed involvement by Western forces or " vo 1 un un t eer s "" — along with Soviet intervention! — into the fighting in Rumania . Western involvement, amazingly, might not require new officials .
 Spillover into the regions where U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed might be very unlikely . The United States has no nuclear weapons in the region where they are deployed .
 To believe that their presence in an area of historic conflict is tolerable must be to believe that highest-level self-control and operational control in crises is absolute, quite literally absolute . The U.S. is in the midst of a historic conflict in Syria .
 In 1962 it could have failed despite leaders on both sides who really were ""determined" to avoid losing control and going to war . In 1962, leaders were determined not to lose control and go to war.
 If this strategy fails in Europe, it can blow the lid off the Northern Hemisphere . And if this . fails, it . can blow off the . Northern . Hemisphere .
 The Bush Administration's position is not clear, but that's the trouble with the strategy, and with the Bush Administration’s position, he says .
 The lesson I indicated in the first section of this paper is all the more pointed in the light of the revelations mentioned in this third part of this article . The lesson was all-important in the wake of this revelation, I said .
 McNamara’s testimony implies that he and President Kennedy were secretly determined to avoid at all costs an air attack or invasion of Cuba that might bring it about . On the one hand, what McNamara's testimony implies is that both he and — after a day or two of reflection
 If this inference is correct, their strategy and aims were considerably more cautious than some others in the ExComm believed them to be . If this was correct, they may have been more cautious .
 Both McNamara and Kennedy seem to have been ready to offer a public trade . The deal involved the withdrawal of U.S. warheads in Turkey along with Soviet missiles in Cuba .
 Robert Kennedy’s explicit ultimatum to Ambassador Dobrynin on the night of October 27 — threatening an air strike in 48 hours and rejecting any possibility of a public trade—appear to have been, in the eyes of the President, enormous bluffs . In short,
 He expected them to fail, and almost surely intended to follow them with major concessions to end the crisis, including withdrawing the Turkish missiles . Moreover, he expected the failure of the Turkish missile tests to fail . He also expected to offer publicly to withdraw the missiles .
 President Kennedy could have found himself doing just that on Sunday, October 28, if Cuban antiaircraft gunners had been closer to their marks on Saturday afternoon . Despite the President’s conscious determination to avoid a war with Soviet forces, his willingness to do almost anything, he could
 Robert Kennedy’s threats to Dobrynin might well have led to war they were anxious to avoid . Kennedy and McNamara were not aware of at the time of the threats .
 It could have had, in the end, the nuclear consequences that they most feared . And it could have been the most feared, they feared, the most .
 Khrushchev’s clever strategy did not end well for him; but it risked, and barely avoided, far worse . The Soviet Union was in the midst of a crisis in the 1950s and '60s .
 The possibility of a premeditated, aggressive surprise attack by Soviet forces ""out of the blue, 11 for the purpose of taking over Western Europe. We could already rule that out — even before the change in Soviet doctrine and deployment and then the opening of the Wall. The opening of
 That was no more a realistic concern under Brezhnev or Khrushchev than it is under Gorbachev . That's no more of a concern under Khrushchchev or Brezhnnev than it was under Gormachev . Gormacheev: Gorm
 If that were only the only way that Soviet tanks might confront NATO SNF, there would be little to worry about . The Soviet Union would not be worried about the threat posed by SNF .
 Pentagon planners postulated a Soviet blitzkrieg offensive against West Germany . Both sides had contingencies in mind that were considerably more realistic, though their responses were not .
 NATO planners regarded this sequence of events as perhaps the most likely of dangerous contingencies . For many years planners regarded it as one among many ways that conflict might arise between NATO and the Warsaw Pact .
 An authoritative article in the most recent issue of Foreign Affairs starts by alluding to this traditionally secret concern .
 One does not have to credit Soviet leaders with an intent to attack Western Europe to believe this . One of the reasons for this is to believe that Western Europe was at risk .
 The peoples of Eastern Europe are no more satisfied today with Soviet dominance than they were before 1914 with Austrian and Russian rule . Eastern Europe is not more satisfied with Soviet rule than it was before 1914 .
 It's not clear that the Soviet rulers are more ready to yield control of this region than were the Romanovs or the Hapsburgs . Nor is it yet clear that . nor are the . Soviet rulers more . ready to surrender control .
 The German problem is certainly not new, though it now arises in a different context . The problem is not a new thing, but it is now a different matter .
 The conflicts of Eastern % % 26 Europe, once the confining cloak of Communist rule has been thrown off, may well be reawakened in all their ancient . values .
 Mikhail Gorbachev’s struggle with the dissident republics of his forcefully built empire is a magnification of a problem that has plagued the USSR almost from its inception . Mikhail's struggle with dissidents has been a problem since the USSR began .
 In the next year or two, independence movements in the USSR should lead to a hardline replacement of Gorbachev by a leader determined to preserve empire in parts of East Europe .
 Administration officials, speaking on background, have not only imagined, they have come close to predicting such a sequence . Administration officials say they have been able to predict the sequence .
 A complex and ambiguous combination of civil war, revolution and international intervention could result . As illustrated by events that occurred—and still others that were postulated--in Rumania last month, December, 1989 .
 If that conflict originated or spilled over into East or West Germany, it would be taking place among the most heavily nuclear-armed units in the world .
 Starting to negotiate today to remove such weapons promptly from both sides of the border would not be too soon, it's not too soon .
 It was reckless and irresponsible for the U.S. and West European governments to bring short-range nuclear weapons into a potential zone of conflict in the Fifties . It was as reckless as it was for Khrushchev to send medium-range missiles to Cuba .
 It should be seen as profoundly unacceptable to defend any borders or national interests by the threat of deliberate firstuse of nuclear weapons, still less by the tacit threat of losing control of such weapons under any circumstances .
 That rules out anything close to present U.S. strategy or nuclear deployment in Western Europe or South Korea . That rule out deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe, South Korea and on United States surface naval vessels .
 U.S. intervention policies throughout the Third World . Likewise, covert nuclear dimensions of United States intervention policies in the world .
 ‘’deterrence” policies of a number of lesser nuclear states . Likewise, the �’’teterrence policies of some lesser states.’'’
