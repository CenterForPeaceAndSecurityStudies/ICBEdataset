 Fifty years ago this month, world attention was fixed on a U.S.-Soviet confrontation over the placement of Soviet nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba . The confrontation was probably the most dangerous and perhaps the most studied moment of the Cold War .
 This iconic crisis has left us a legacy of lessons and insights for the future, many only recognized in recent years as previously classified materials have become available . The legacy of this crisis has been left behind us, with many lessons only recognized as recently classified materials .
 President Kennedy signs Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba at the Oval Office on October 23, 1962 . Bruce W MacDonald, senior adviser to the Nonproliferation and Arms Control Program with the United States Institute of Peace’s Office of Special Initi
 Earlier, he was senior director of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the U.S. He was a bipartisan body headed by former Defense Secretaries William Perry and James Schlesinger .
 MacDonald has also served at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Security Council and the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs . MacDonald has served in the House Armed Services Committee and State Department .
 More and more previously closely-held information from both sides has become available . Based on what we now know, the United States and the USSR were coming from quite different perspectives .
 In the fall of 1962, the Soviet Union, led by Premier Nikita Khrushchev, saw itself in an increasingly precarious strategic situation . The Soviet Union saw itself as in a 'strategic crisis'
 The Politburo in Moscow believed it needed to take a dramatic step . Facing a wide and still growing United States advantage in nuclear weapons, especially those that could strike the Soviet homeland . The USSR was ringed by many United States nuclear bomber bases within allied countries around the USSR�
 The failed invasion of Cuban exiles at Cuba’s Bay of Pigs reinforced Soviet views that the U.S. would invade the Soviet Union . That perception was reinforced by the failure of the failed invasion at the Bay .
 Khrushchev decided to position medium-range nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba . The move strengthened the Soviet ability to deter American actions, such as invading Cuba .
 President Kennedy considered such a new threat intolerable and outrageous, as well as a complete surprise . President John Kennedy called such a threat intolerable, outrageous, and a surprise .
 The Soviets conducted their missile deployments in secret and lied to the U.S. government about them . The missiles were only discovered by the United States intelligence after the deployment process was well underway .
 The U.S. had foresworn any effort to “roll back” communism in the early 1960s . The Soviets and their proxies were pushing forward on all fronts to advance their own area of control .
 As it became clear that Fidel Castro, who had seized power in Cuba in 1959, was a Communist and a Soviet ally, the impression in the United States was that the Soviets were pressing forward across the globe and trying to outflank America .
 Kennedy ordered a U.S. “quarantine” of Cuba before additional, longer-range Soviet missiles could be shipped to Cuba . Kennedy ordered the quarantine before additional Soviet missiles were shipped .
 Both countries substantially raised their nuclear-alert levels, and the world quickly moved toward the precipice of all-out nuclear war .
 The U.S. faced a significant escalation of the nuclear threat from the USSR . The American public would expect and demand Washington to take action . The United States suddenly faced an escalation of nuclear threat .
 Many countries relied on the United States for security guarantees . If the U.S. took no action to so direct a threat to its own homeland, that could undercut belief that Washington would honor its security commitments to others .
 The Soviet Union, having made this move, was very reluctant to back down, both for its own global reasons and because doing so could undercut Castro . Castro's government was very cautious about backing down .
 With so much at stake, nuclear weapons at the core of the controversy, all-out nuclear war became a real possibility . The U.S. nuclear weapons are at the heart of the nuclear debate .
 The Cuban missile crisis was the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war . The Cuban missiles crisis was a precursor to the threat of nuclear war in the 1960s .
 Some of the Soviet missiles and bombers in Cuba were not under the direct control of senior leadership in Moscow and thus could have been launched by less cautious military officers . The U.S. nuclear-armed bombers were placed on airborne alert .
 It would not have taken much of a misunderstanding or misinterpreted command to trigger at least an isolated use of nuclear weapons, which could then have ignited a full nuclear exchange .
 Some participants in the crisis believed they might not ever see loved ones again . Some participants thought they might never ever see them again . Others believed they may not ever be able to see their loved ones .
 There were several ways to resolve crises and conflict situations today . These are also common to resolving other crises and conflicts today .
 Buy time to give diplomacy a chance to work, which entails refraining from the direct use of force but not taking that option off the table . Buy time for diplomacy to work. Buy time . Refrain from using force .
 Kennedy’s decision to impose a “quarantine,” of Cuba meant that a number of days would pass before additional Soviet ships with more missiles would approach the island and a confrontation would occur .
 Kennedy ruled against military advice to use conventional weapons to bomb missile sites at this stage . Move would have caused Russian and Cuban casualties and further escalated crisis .
 The quarantine showed U.S. resolve but created space for bilateral diplomacy to find solutions . The quarantine was an option that demonstrated United States resolve . Kennedy chose to quarantine the ships carrying missiles from Cuba .
 High-level, high-intensity diplomacy, both formal and informal, could and did proceed . "High-level" diplomacy was possible, but diplomacy was not possible in the U.S. State Department .
 The second element was the willingness of each side to allow the other a face-saving way out of the crisis . The two elements were the willingness to allow each side a face saving way out .
 For the Soviet Union, something had to be done to provide at least the appearance of addressing both the U.S.-Soviet strategic imbalance and concerns about a United States invasion of Cuba . The Soviet Union had to do something to address both the American and Soviet strategic imbalance .
 In the solution reached, the Soviets removed the missiles already deployed in Cuba . Soviet ships under sail with missile cargoes returned to Soviet ports .
 The U.S. agreed to remove a squadron of obsolete medium-range Jupiter missiles based in Turkey as long as that part of the deal was kept secret . In return, the United States will remove an obsolete fleet of old-range missiles .
 The United States publicly pledged it would not invade Cuba . In addition to the pledge, the U.S. has pledged not to invade the island nation .
 Turkey believed that the Jupiter missiles improved their security . Cuba was not happy with only a United States pledge on paper not to invade . Turkey believed the missiles improved security .
 Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. recognized that much larger issues were at stake . Both countries managed their allies’s concerns in other ways .
 Both sides emerged from the crisis with their core concerns intact . Public perception at the time saw the U.S. as the greater winner .
 The third part was the ability of senior leadership to communicate directly with one another or through trusted emissaries . Senior leadership also had to be able to communicate with each other, says the president .
 Robert Kennedy and Anatoly Dobrynin were trusted by their own country and respected by the other . Both sides were ably served by the work of individuals trusted by both countries . Reducing chances for misunderstanding and miscalculation is essential to successful diplomacy .
 The fourth element was the willingness of top leadership on both sides, to come to grips with the devastating consequences of a nuclear war . The fourth, and somewhat surprising, element of this is the willingness to discuss the possibility of war .
 Senior civilian leadership in Washington and Moscow realized that a way had to be found to avoid nuclear war . The compromises resulted in compromises that under lesser pressures may not have been politically feasible . Under lesser pressures, the compromises were not feasible .
 This was probably the first time that leaders had to look at the monster of nuclear war straight in the eye . They both feared what they saw .
 The Cuban missile crisis led to a number of improvements in the international strategic environment, including agreements to begin to restrain the competition in nuclear arms .
 The Washington-Moscow “hotline” was established less than seven months ago . It gives leaders of both countries a direct link during crises and thereby reducing chances for misunderstanding .
 In addition, the United States and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to ban above-ground nuclear testing . The following year, the U.S. and the . Soviet Union also signed a ban on above ground nuclear testing in addition to the agreement .
 The pact was also driven by increasing worldwide concerns over radioactive nuclear fallout in milk and other food supplies . A desire to reduce nuclear threats was the overriding factor .
 The Non-Proliferation Treaty was negotiated and signed in 1967 . It was designed to halt the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries . The United States and Soviet Union took their first steps in nuclear arms control .
 Late 1969 saw the beginning of negotiations that led to the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty . The first treaty was signed by the U.S. in 1969 .
 The outcome was also a shot in the arm for U.S. diplomacy more generally . It reinforced the notion that effective diplomacy has a central role to play in United States security policy . The outcome also reinforced the importance of effective diplomacy in the United States .
 Strategic surprise can be destabilizing and lead to rushed and possibly unwise decisions by the surprised party . Where a country’s vital national interests are concerned, strategic surprise is destabilizing .
 Second is the need to identify core interests that need to be protected and one’s objectives in interactions with an opponent . The need to convey as much clarity on them as possible with one's opponent, and to convey them to one another .
 Third, it is essential that each party in a nuclear interaction put itself in the shoes of its opponent and ask why that country is behaving the way that it is. It is essential to ask why each country is acting the way it is .
 As successful as the missile crisis outcome was, more than one scholar has noted the failure of Kennedy and his senior advisers to ponder more fully why the Soviet Union was introducing the missiles to Cuba in the first place .
 Understanding where the Soviets were coming from would have added clarity in choosing among Washington’s diplomatic and military options . This does not mean that the Soviet Union should have been allowed to do so, but understanding where it was coming from .
 Clearly, the Soviets also had not thought through how the Americans would react if their clandestine scheme came to light . The Soviets also did not know how the U.S. would react .
 Each party needs to emerge from a high-stakes confrontation with a face-saving outcome . Further, each party must emerge from the confrontation with an end-earning outcome .
 A confrontation can come to be seen as an end in itself, without recognition that other issues in the future will be indirectly influenced by the outcome of a current crisis . A confrontation is seen as a result of a crisis, but not an end to itself .
 Knowing that the other side is not bent on absolute triumph and humiliation of the adversary improves the chances for win-win outcomes in the future . Knowing that other side isn't bent on winning and humiliation improves the chance of a better outcome .
 In major-power confrontations, a strong military posture is essential for a country . The U.S. fleet can favorably influence diplomacy, as it did in this case, as the American fleet .
 Armed action should always be used in support of diplomatic and political goals, says David Cameron . But resorts to actual armed action should generally be considered as a later-stage instrument to be drawn upon only as necessary .
 Premature recourse to ‘kinetic’ operations can spark premature escalation and poor decision making . Premature use of “kinetic operations’s now called ‘kinsetic” operations is now called 'kinetic' operations .
 Skillful diplomacy can also make military issues easier to resolve when military steps are required, such as winning agreement by allies and others to assist . Diplomats can also help resolve military issues such as the need to take military action .
 The tendency in a complex crisis to take the seemingly easy way out with a quick turn to military force should be avoided, and time allowed to give diplomacy a chance .
