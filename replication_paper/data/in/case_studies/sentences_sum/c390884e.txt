 The crisis stemmed from Khrushchev’s secret dispatch of nuclear missiles to Cuba . US president John F Kennedy determined to reverse that deployment – and climaxed during the famous “13 Days” “eyeball-to-eyeballs”
 Any serious analysis requires assessing how multiple narratives converged to bring the Cold War to its tensest apex . Yet, any serious analysis must be done, and it's critical to understand how the events unfolded .
 Most broadly, the crisis dramatized the chasm between ends and means that Hiroshima portended for international aﬀairs . The crisis starkly dramatizes the chasms between ends of the ends and ends of Hiroshima .
 Both Khrushchev and Kennedy sought their political goals short of a hazardous military collision . Cuba itself represented a vital interest for neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union .
 Any direct clash, whether intentional or accidental, was fraught with the danger of uncontrollable escalation . Nevertheless, in the supercharged atmosphere of the missile crisis, with forces on high alert, any direct clash would be fraught .
 Khrushchev wrote Kennedy, “if indeed war should break out, then it would not be in our power to stop it, for such is the logic of war.” Kennedy wrote .
 How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb fused subversive humor and technical verisimilitude to depict accidental nuclear war and hilariously mock Cold War paranoia . The film is set to be released in the summer of 2015 .
 While we’re attacking frontally Watch Brinkally and Huntally4 . Describing contrapuntally The cities we have lost. Describing the cities we've lost. The cities they have lost .
 Khrushchev embraced this recipe for his own ratcheting up tensions to discover whether the West would cave . John Foster Dulles had espoused “brinkmanship” – the doctrine to display unﬂinchingly, when challenged, the nerve to risk nuclear war
 In late 1958, he launched a drive to expel U.S. and allied military forces from Berlin . The move was intended to ease the absorption of the divided capital into East Germany .
 Eisenhower and Kennedy vowed they would stay put, but Khrushchev repeatedly turned up the heat . Eisenhower, Kennedy and Eisenhower vowed to stay put in the camp .
 Sooner or later, the superpowers would have to break their habit of meeting at the brink – because a crisis exploded into all-out war, or grew so terrifying as to sober them up . The U.S. and the world's two superpowers meet at the very brink
 The question has gnawed at oﬃcials and analysts since they were first discovered . The question is still unanswered .
 On May 21, 1962, he formally proposed secretly deploying mediumand intermediate-range nuclear missiles to Cuba . The Presidium provisionally approved his concept three days later . Castro’s wary approval, ratiﬁed it on June 10 .
 JFK publicly warned in early September against introducing “oﬀensive weapons” to Cuba . The Soviet leader upped the ante by augmenting (and sending nuclear-armed submarines to escort) this atomic arsenal .
 The total buildup, apparent to U.S. reconnaissance by late summer, also included tanks, surface-to-air missiles, MiG-21 jetters, and roughly 50,000 soldiers and technicians .
 Like Harry S Truman’s dropping of the atom bomb on Japan (which combined short-term military and political aims), it had overlapping objectives . Khrushchev's venture deﬁes mono-causal explanation .
 By establishing Cuba as an unsinkable strategic missile base, Americans guessed Khrushchev sought to double Soviet capacity to hit targets in the continental United States . Americans guessed he wanted to double capacity to . hit targets more cheaply and easily .
 The nuclear balance did, indeed, vex Khrushchev – especially in view of his lagging ICBM program – and enhance the deployment’s attractions . The balance was indeed vexed, especially in the view of the Soviet Union's lagging program .

 Khrushchev also wanted to avoid losing ground to Beijing in Havana itself . Khruschev wanted to prevent losing ground in Cuba itself .

 Khrushchev indulged in threatening behavior that undercut East–West progress . Yet, unlike his reformist successor, he also indulged into threatening behavior . He was one of the most powerful men in the world .
 As Khrushchev puzzled over how to save Cuba, the prohibitive cost of fending oﬀ its giant neighbor magniﬁed the allure of a nuclear deterrent . Much as his enemy had laid a tripwire in West Germany rather than match Soviet conventional forces
 Khrushchev emulated Dulles’s “brinkmanship” of seeking “more bang for the buck” through increased reliance on nuclear weapons . Eisenhower sought ‘New Look’ of seeking more bang for buck’ through reliance on nukes .
 Khrushchev steamrollered the Presidium, but odds are remote that his associates, if in power, would have chanced nuclear war for Cuba’s sake . Odds are remote his associates would have taken action for Cuba's sake .
 Though hardly irrational, the deployment did not simply ﬂow from a detached reckoning of Soviet interests . The deployment was not simply an irrational decision .
