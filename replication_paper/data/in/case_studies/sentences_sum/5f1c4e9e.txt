 Kennedy ultimately chose the second option and announced it on 22 October in nationally televised address . Kennedy ultimately decided to make the decision in a nationally televised speech .
 The Cuban option and the ªrst (direct military action against Cuba) have been exhaustively analyzed over the years by Western scholars . That option and that option has been studied extensively by the U.S. in the past .
 Much less attention has been devoted to the third alternative, the diplomatic route . The diplomatic route is the third option, but it could be used in the future .
 This article shows that a variant of that option was actually adopted by Kennedy at the peak of the crisis . This article has never previously received any serious scholarly treatment of Kennedy's views .
 The Kennedy administration chose to employ the Brazilian government of President João Goulart as an intermediary in this highly sensitive and tightly concealed effort to reach Castro at the height of the missile crisis .
 Kennedy at one point had regarded Goulart as a potential “New Frontiersman” and a valuable partner in the Alliance for Progress . U.S. ofªcials increasingly viewed the Brazilian president with irritation, exasperation, and suspicion for mismanagement .
 Some within the Kennedy administration even began to consider supporting a military coup in Brazil rather than risk seeing the country end up in Communist hands . The Kennedy administration considered supporting a coup rather than backing a coup .
 The story of this secret U.S.-Brazilian-Cuban triangular diplomacy sheds light on a previously little-known aspect of the Cuban missile crisis . The story sheds light not only on the hidden efforts at dialogue between Washington and Havana .
 The secret Brazilian mediation effort during the missile crisis climaxed three years of Brazilian diplomatic efforts, spanning three Brazilian and two American presidencies, to play a direct role .
 Brazilian ofªcials were less alarmed than U.S. leaders by the supposed menace of Fidelismo . They watched with increasing dismay as Washington, in their view, became obsessed with Cuba to the detriment of relations with Latin America .
 At the height of the prestige of the . newly formed non-aligned movement, Brazilian leaders . “irted with a more “independent,” quasi-neutralist foreign policy through which they could escape subservience and irrelevance within the United States sphere of inº
 In domestic political terms, Brazilian leaders had to deal with substantial leftist and nationalist constituencies that were sympathetic to the Cuban revolution and resentful of the U.S.
 Achieving a settlement that preserved Cuba’s sovereignty and internal political orientation from American pressure would be a major achievement in both domestic and international political terms . The settlement would preserve Cuba's sovereignty, yet that also satisªed Washington .
 Fifth, mediation suited Brazil’s consistent emphasis on respect for the principles of self-determination and non-intervention with regard to Cuba and Castro's socioeconomic system . The mediation took place in Cuba and Cuba in the 1960s .
 Brazilian leaders hoped to foster Cuba’s ultimate reintegration into the inter-American system . They decried Castro’�s increasing ‘extra-continental” links to the Soviet bloc .
 As U.S.-Cuban relations plummeted, Brazil’s ambassador in Havana tried to convince Castro to adopt a more moderate stance toward the United States . Brazil's Vasco Tristão Leitão Leita Leita da Cunha was an early enthusiast for the Cuban
 They also were in contact with the U.S. ambassador, Philip Bonsal, in a bid to foster a civilized dialogue . They also met with the United States ambassador to encourage dialogue .
 Castro accused Washington of responsibility for blowing up a French ship that was carrying arms to the Cuban government in early March, an explosion that killed seventy-ªve Cuban dock workers as well as French shipmen . U.S.-Cuban relations reached a new low when Castro said Washington
 Despite this setback, the two Latin American envoys persisted in arranging all-night asados with Castro and his associates . They continued to arrange dinner parties and dinner parties with U.S. diplomats .
 The Brazilian, Mexican, and Canadian foreign ministers continued to promote mediation during an Organization of American States foreign ministers’ meeting in Costa Rica . This overture received a cordial brush-off in Washington, but the Brazilian, . Mexican, . Canadian, . Brazilian foreign ministers continue to
 All these efforts went nowhere, primarily because the positions of the two sides were incompatible . The positions of both sides are incompatible .

 Despite expressing mild interest in patching up relations with Havana, the administration had embarked on a covert effort in mid-March 1960 to overthrow the Castro leadership .
 The covert operation was nearing a decision point at the beginning of 1961 when Kennedy took ofªce in Washington . Jânio Quadros was the governor of Sao Paulo who had raised eyebrows in Washington with a friendly campaign trip to Cuba .

 Quadros launched an intensive bid to broker some sort of deal between Castro and the incoming U.S. administration . Quadros was encouraged by the Cuban chargé d’affaires in Rio de Janeiro .
 Castro enlisted the help of former Brazilian ambassador da Cunha to promote a ‘Finlandization’ arrangement whereby Castro would relinquish Soviet-bloc military support and accept neutrality in the Cold War in exchange for U.S. commitments from the United States .
 Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós thanked Brazil for its efforts . He denied that his chargé had been authorized to request mediation . The U.S. must “take the ªrst step” to improve relations, he said .
 Even if the Cubans had been more receptive, Washington evinced little interest in compromise, for reasons that became obvious in mid-April 1961 with the failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs .
 Cuba the following month requested aid from Brazil, along with Ecuador and Mexico, in opening a dialogue with Washington . Seeking to consolidate Latin American support after this United States setback, Cuba sought aid from the region .
 In 1961, hemispheric leaders gathered at the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este to discuss the Kennedy administration’s new Alliance for Progress . But that gambit sank amid diplomatic confusion,8 proved less signiªcant than an episode that took place
 At the close of the summit, Brazilian and Argentine diplomats arranged a late-night cocktail-party rendezvous between Cuban Fi4 and Brazilian diplomats .
 A National Security Council staff aide suggested just prior to the invasion that Washington might avail itself of Brazil’s services to “settle accounts” with Cuba . A more favorable solution to the Castro problem might be obtained, McGeorge Bundy said .

 Guevara raised the prospect of achieving “at least an interim modus vivendi” between Havana and Washington, even if a genuine “understanding” remained impossible . On a more serious note,
 Goodwin advocated “some way of continuing this below ground dialogue which Che has begun,” if only as a means to “probe for a split in the top leadership” while simultaneously pursuing anti-Castro policies and covert operations . Goodwin: “Some way of
 The Argentine-born revolutionary, “wearing green fatigues, and his usual overgrown and scraggly beard,” failed to open any U.S.-Cuban communication .
 Only a few days after Guevera continued on to Rio de Janeiro where Quadros decorated him with the country’s most distinguished award for foreigners, the cruzeiro do sul . The Brazilian leader suddenly resigned, sparking a brief but tumultuous political crisis .
 "Jango" Goulart was a labor minister under and protégé of the strongman Getulio Vargas in the early 1950s . His replacement was the vice president, “Jango” Goulhart .
 Quadros was judged by U.S. analysts to be “a demagogue and opportunist, without ideology or ideals” Quadros’s coincidental presence in “Red” China on a trade mission at the time of his resignation hardly reassured them .
 The problem, the president stressed, was not bilateral but hemispheric and did not stem from Cuba’s internal changes . Castro's devotion to international Communism, he said, is to blame .
 Campos says Moscow must distinguish between acceptance of Cuba’s social reforms and rejection of its ‘satellitization’ by Moscow . Campos: It would be useful to disseminate more widely evidence of Havana's subversive inªltration .
 Cuba’s “insolent attitude,” in the words of a secret analysis by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry in September 1961, included the promotion of an ‘armed revolutionary struggle’ in Brazil to prevent a military takeover during the political crisis that followed Quadros�
 Castro’s statement in December 1961 unabashedly describing himself and his revolution as Marxist-Leninist further irritated Brazilian ofªcials, whose resistance to harsh anti-Cuban measures declined .
 Dantas acknowledged a “slight difference’s” policy toward Cuba in a secret Itamaraty strategy session . Later that month, at a secret strategy session, he acknowledged the difference .
 Quadros had at times exhibited “a slight trace of ideological sympathy and a systematic denial and sometimes even evasive position” toward Cuba, the new Brazilian 14 says . The new president of Brazil will be Brazil's president .
 Castro made these comments during a televised address on 29 August 1961 . Castro made the comments during an address to the nation on August 29 1961 .
 Goulart and Kennedy's honeymoon coincided with murky reports of a power struggle inside the Cuban leadership . There were intimations of possible strains between Havana and Moscow .
 For the ªrst time since the revolution, Fidel Castro seemed to be taking a less prominent role, observers in Havana noticed . For the first time in three months of 1962, observers noticed that .
 Castro’s prolonged absences from public view prompted speculation that a behind-the-scenes battle for the leadership had begun . Castro has not been seen in public for more than a month .
 Castro resurfaced on 26 March to deliver a spirited television address announcing a purge of senior members of the Cuban Communist party . Such rumors found conªrmation when Castro resurfaces to deliver television address .
 Targeted in the purge were ofªcials who were considered closest to Moscow, including one of the party’s leading minister Aníbal Escalante .
 The “Escalante Affair’s” did not receive wide attention in the United States . It was a secret Brazilian mediation effort during Goulart's visit to the U.S. in early April 1962 .
 This episode foreshadowed the initiative that would emerge during the missile crisis . This episode merits close attention here because it foreshadowes the initiative . The missile crisis would be the first time the U.S. launched a nuclear strike in North Korea .
 In June, Moscow named Aleksandr Alekseev, far more popular than Sergei Kudryavtsev, as the new Soviet envoy . Aleksandr Aleksoev is more popular in Castro's circle than Kudyravtsov .
 The visit seemed to kindle a degree of personal rapport between the Brazilian and U.S. presidents . The visit even seemed to sortle a personal rapport with the two presidents .
 The discussions focused mainly on bilateral relations, U.S. economic aid, the recent military coup in Argentina, and the recent economic crisis in Brazil .
 Foreign Minister Dantas raised the issue of Cuba with Secretary of State Rusk . The two leaders concluded their talks on 4 April .
 In the Brazilian’s view, the political and economic situation in Cuba was “rapidly” deteriorating, he says . Castro was ‘in a ªght” with (and “in danger of being discarded by”) the Communists,
 Dantas foresaw a nationalistic, nonaligned brand of Cuban socialism or Communism along the lines of Tito’s Yugoslavia as a plausible scenario . Noting that Khrushchev ‘despises’ Castro, he foresaw nationalistic socialism or a nonaligned
 Rusk allowed that if Castro made “a clear break with Moscow,” then a “change” in U.S. policy might ensue . Rusk: If Castro made a ‘clear break” with Moscow then a change’ in U .
 He seemed to agree that recent intelligence signaled a potentially signiªcant split in the leadership, alluding to 21 .
 A formal severance of diplomatic ties with the USSR would not be necessary even if it might be a logical and desirable result, he said . He added that a formal severing of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union would not necessarily be necessary .
 It had been no accident, the American responded, that Washington had never asked Brazil to break diplomatic relations with Castro’s Cuba . The American said it had never been asked for the change .
 Dantas proposed to consult with his ambassador to Havana, Luís Bastian Pinto, in Mexico City a few days later, during a visit there by Goulart .
 Rusk invited Dantas to join him for a cruise on the Potomac in the president’s boat, weather permitting, on the afternoon of 12 April to take up the matter .
 After Dantas left town, Rusk checked cautiously within the administration to see if he could ofªcially authorize the Brazilian enterprise . Rusk: "I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to authorize this kind of thing"
 Given the explosive nature of the proposition, he presumably checked at some point with the president himself . No record of such a conversation has emerged .
 Rusk ran into hardline opposition on 10 April when he mentioned Dantas’s proposal to Director of Central Intelligence John A McCone, the Republican who had replaced Allen W Dulles after the Bay of Pigs debacle .
 McCone abhorred the idea of making any sort of deal with Castro . McCone obviously abhorred .
 According to McCone’s secret account of the conversation,23 Rusk assured him that he had, in his conªdential discussions with Dantas, reafªrmed Washington’�s non-negotiable points—that 23.23
 Dantas says the Castro regime was split at the top and that a serious conictict existed between Castro and his followers on the one hand and the hard-line Communists on the other .
 Dantas felt that this split might be capitalized on and the Communist regime disposed of . The Communist regime was disposed of by the split, he said .
 Rusk envisaged a two-stage operation; . ªrst the rupture between Castro and the Communist and, . second the disposal of Castro . The operation was envisaged by Rusk, who died in 1961 .
 The CIA was actively pursuing various schemes to assassinate the Cuban leader at the time . Secretary of State’s knowledge of these schemes has not previously been documented .
 The phrasing would not exclude Castro’s physical elimination, even if the context suggested merely his ejection from any role in ruling the island . Castro's physical elimination could not exclude his physical elimination .
 Rusk hoped to exploit the Brazilian initiative without informing Dantas or his associates of Washington’s ultimate aim . In any case, it appears that Rusk wanted to set Rio up for a double-cross .
 Brazil's foreign minister reported on his conversation with Brazil’s envoy to Havana on Thursday afternoon, 12 April . The Brazilian foreign minister was in Mexico City with the Brazilian envoy to Cuba .
 Rusk telephoned McCone and asked for his “fellows’ best appreciation” of the Brazilian foreign minister . Rusk called McCone to thank Dantas for his support .
 The next afternoon, as requested, McCone sent over a one-page CIA proªle of Dantas . The next day, the CIA sent over the document to the White House .
 It was a harshly critical portrait of a “brilliant, although unscrupulous” lawyer and politician . It highlighted his alleged sympathy for “the authoritarian type of leadership” and his distaste for the United States, and ambition to become prime minister .
 Rusk sent a cable to the newly installed U.S. ambassador in Rio, Lincoln Gordon, informing him on an ‘eyes only’ basis of his conversation with Dantas . Rusk cleared the cable after it was drafted by Edwin Martin, the assistant secretary of state
 On 27 April, Martin sent Gordon a follow-up cable asking him to check with Dantas . Martin has been in touch with Gordon since April .
 The Brazilian ofªcial stressed the “impossibility” of a return in Cuba to the ‘pre-revolutionary status quo” for which Miami-based anti-Castro émigrés were clamoring . He said the Cuban government is not ready to
 The spring 1962 Brazilian initiative stalled there, perhaps because Castro never came back with concrete proposals . Dantas predicted that Castro would come back with a concrete proposal .
 The hints of a potential split in Havana had not gone unnoticed in Washington . Nevertheless, the hints of the possible split in Cuba had not been unnoticed .
 In some quarters, the murmurings in Havana continued to generate support for an overture to Castro that would offer a plausible alternative to the Mongoose operations designed to overthrow him, an effort that was yielding few if any prospects for success .
 In May 1962, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs Richard Goodwin secretly raised the idea of such an approach . Goodwin had shifted from his White House duties to the State Department but remained an important policymaker in policy .
 Goodwin sensed “an opportunity for a tentative probe designed to test the 33.5-year-old’s 33.6 Cuban power struggle, Goodwin said . Goodwin sensed an opportunity for “a tentative probe” into Cuba . Goodwin: "An opportunity for an opportunity
 Goodwin says it would be ‘foolish’ to speculate that Soviet-Cuban ties had reached ‘the breaking point’ He says rupture would likely emerge from a “split in the top leadership” than from a popular anti-Communist revolt . Goodwin
 The U.S. would have to assuage fears that Washington would try to overthrow him or insist on the return of properties expropriated during the revolution . The Cuban leader would also have to be assuaged by assuring him that the United States would not overthrow him .
 Goodwin rejected the idea of a Latin American, particularly a Brazilian, mediator between Washington and Havana, given the danger of exposure . Goodwin said Washington viewed the skepticism with which Washington viewed “neutralist” initiatives . Goodwin also rejected the notion of a Brazilian mediator as a medi
 The idea of a private message from Washington to Castro lay dormant during the summer and early autumn of 1962 . The Kennedy administration focused its attention on continuing its efforts to isolate Havana .
 The administration also was continuing and expanding its covert operations and assassination plots in the hope of eventually toppling Castro . The administration was also expanding its assassination plots .
 Beginning in the late summer, U.S. ofªcials were alarmed by growing indications of a Soviet military buildup in Cuba . They sought to counter Republican charges that Kennedy was being ‘soft” on Cuba in what was emerging as a central issue in the midterm congressional
 All of this militates against any overture, no matter how discreet, to Cuba . Cuba. Cuba .
 Rusk-McCone disagreement over the feasibility of encouraging or exploiting Soviet-Cuban friction persisted . Meanwhile, the Rusk and McCone disagreed over the possibility of using friction between the two countries .
 The meeting turned back to ideas for intensifying Mongoose . McCone also was requested “to emphasize measures to foment a Castro–oldline Com35 .
 It is not known what measures McCone and the CIA took to promote this aim prior to the missile crisis .
