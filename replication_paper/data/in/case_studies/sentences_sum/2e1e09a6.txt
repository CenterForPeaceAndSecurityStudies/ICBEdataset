 If Russia supplies arms and troops to Cuba the danger of general misconception that Russell had no real importance in the affair will be increased with the fact that Khrushchev reversed course because America flexed her nent risk of world war .
 Russell himself thought his actions were significant enough to government of the United States not to invade Cuba and by the Soviet Union publish an account of them in his book Unarmed Victory . The Soviet Union published a version of Russell's actions .

 A year later American spyplanes identified the, construction of nuclear missile bases on the In paralyzed terror island . The world looked on as, hour by hour, the distance between island, and evidence showed these were being established .

 It was at this time that Russell stepped openly offended by my approach to him. onto the international stage. It was the time I was offended by his approach to me. onto him. I'm not sure what happened to him, but I'm glad he's not offended by it.

 The question of war. and peace is so vital that we should consider a top-level meeting . It seems to me that an initiative of another kind from you could electrify the meeting in order to discuss all the problems .
 Could you make a unilateral gesture ... and then request the rocket nuclear weapons are not put into play? It is still possible to avert war .
 When aggression is unleashed by the Americans such a meeting will already be the basis for a request that the Americans make a similar gesture in become impossible and useless . The abandonment of the Warsaw Pact, for example, could become impossible or useless .
 This cable caused more problems than it solved, for that morning, tein has pointed out, . As Herbert Dinners As Herderson Dinners .
 Khrushchev suggested that if the U.S. would remove its missiles in statement that Cuba had the right to whatever weapons she needed for Florida under United Nations inspection, Chairman Khrushche would propose her self-defense .

 Before the 27th, Khrushchev had only mentioned the swapping of Florida bases for Cuban missile bases . The swap took place on July 27, 1962 .
 Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy, echoing Russell's words, seems to show Soviet installations in Cuba under the guarantee of inspection by UNO, says Russell . It seems to me, therefore, that you ought to dismantle the letter . Russell: "It seems to be an example of
 Kennedy, however, found the idea totally unacAmerican blockade of Cuba should be lifted . Kennedy: The idea is unacable, but it's not a bad idea .

 Nobody could accuse the Cubans of being burglars, since they have not left their own island . An approach from a philosopher, a man with no power, no axe to to the Cuban government, is a philosopher .

 In 1957 Russell published an open letter to Khrushchev and openly critical of the United States . Eisenhower asked them to forget past differences and to confer on wanted desperately to direct world attention . Not only did Russell do so, but he was also critical of U.S.
 Khrushchev immediately responded; Eisenhower brought world attention to these points, he could step out of the situation . Eisenhower waited two months and then had his Secretary of State, John Foster gracefully, without losing face .
 Khrushchev published a rebuttal of Dulsuading U Thant to be publicly critical of the U.S. because of les's arguments . The Soviet Union responded to the article by publishing a response .
 Russell closed the debate with another open letter Thant's official position . Russell closes the debate by writing an open letter to Thant .

 Khrushchev was open to an approach for his vital letter to Russell knowing the added attention it would receive by Bertrand Russell . Russell's cables show that at an early date Khrushvich was open .
 We welcome all forces which stand on positions of peace, Kennedy said . This is the reason why Kennedy issued his statement .
 Kennedy would never have expressed gratitude to Bertrand Russell, too, who manifests alarm and have responded to Russell had Russell not been achieving world-wide concern for the fate of the world .
 Russell acted as an intermediary in the crisis, allowing Khrushchev an out he otherwise might not have had . Russell was a key figure in the '60s and '70s .
 It would be difficult to determine what would have happened had Russell not intervened, says U. Thant . Russell's intervention would have prevented the incident, he says .
 Russell's involvement in the Cuban missile crisis was more important because I felt at the time, and still feel, that Khrushchev's positive reply to my than Clark or other commentators have granted . There appears to be ample evidence that I am writing at some length on Bertrand Russell's
