 Back in the 1950s and the early days of Castro’s regime, there were some sympathetic stories about Fidel and his Cuban rebels . There were in the mainstream media, as well as the men's adventure magazines, in the late 1950s .
 In 1959, Errol Flynn made a so-bad-it’s-good men's adventure style movie that portrayed Castro and his guerrillas as heroic freedom fighters, called Cuban Rebel Girls . Flynn even made a movie about Castro and the guerillas .
