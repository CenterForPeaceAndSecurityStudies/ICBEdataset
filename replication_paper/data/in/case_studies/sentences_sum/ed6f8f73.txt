 In the wake of the Iran-contra affair, the role of intelligence in U.S. national security policy process is again being examined by members of both the executive and legislative branches .
 Not since the Church and Pike committee hearings in the mid-1970s have the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency come under scrutiny . The CIA's activities have come under such scrutiny since the 1970s .
 The Tower Commission and Iran-contra Committee exposed the extent to which key CIA officials were involved in the Reagan administration's efforts to secure the release of the American hostages in Lebanon and to finance and supply the resistance forces in Nicaragua .
 The CIA's involvement in these two policy initiatives has raised questions about the overall relationships between intelligence and policy during the Reagan administration . The CIA has been involved in both initiatives .
 The heart of the intelligence-policy relationship remains the analysis and dissemination of intelligence information . The relationship between the U.S. and the world's most powerful intelligence agencies is critical of the relationship .
 How closely intelligence officials should collaborate with policymakers has long been debated . Analysts should be integrated into the policy process, analysts have long debated .
 William Casey's role as Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan administration exemplified one of the extreme positions in this debate . Casey served as the CIA Director in the 1980s .
 Casey was the first DCI to serve as a cabinet member . Casey advised the president on both intelligence matters and policy issues . Casey was a strong policy advocate who advised both intelligence and policy .
 Casey credited with improving the quality, relevance, and timeliness of intelligence analysis . But his active role in the policy process had adverse effects on the intelligence-policy relationship .
 Currently, he is in the Central Intelligence Agency's Photographic Interpretation Center . He is a member of the Photographic Interpreterment Center .
 Secretary of State George Schultz testified that even before the Iranian arms deal, he had come to have grave concerns about the objectivity and reliability of some of the intelligence he was getting .
 Those advocating a clear separation between intelligence analysis and policy formulation will draw upon Casey's record to support their argument . Casey is a former CIA director of intelligence operations .
 Casey's example should not stand as the reason a DCI should be excluded from active involvement in the policy process . Casey should not have been excluded from the DCI's role in policy decisions .
 The short history of the American intelligence establishment contains other cases where the DCI, by directly engaging policymakers, enhanced the formulation and execution of national policy . The DCI has served the intelligence community well and served the nation well .
 The net result in such cases was a smooth and effective intelligence-policy relationship, says the author .
 John McCone's leadership and the CIA's role before and during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis stand out as a good example of an effective intelligence policy relationship .
 The thirteen-day incident has, for two decades now, been used as a textbook case for studying national security crisis management . The 13-day period has been used to teach crisis management in the past .
 The missile crisis offers valuable lessons on how senior intelligence officials can work closely with policymakers, while protecting the objectivity and integrity of intelligence . But when viewed from the perspective of the intelligence-policy relationship, the missile crisis also offers lessons .
 Previously classified information has shed light on the role played by McCone and the CIA during the period when the Soviet Union attempted to deploy offensive missiles .
 McCone's role is examined by tracing his participation in executive committee meetings; evaluating the quality, timeliness, and relevance of the intelligence reporting related to the crisis . McCone is also examined by evaluating his role in intelligence reporting .
 In the context of the debate over the proper role of intelligence in the policy process, the positive and negative implications of McCone's approach will then be considered . In the debate, the debate will be focused on the role of the intelligence in policy .
 Theoretical arguments about the role of intelligence in the policy process usually center on the interaction between intelligence officers and policymakers . Intelligence analysis can be integrated into policy formulation .
 The traditionalists believe a clear separation between intelligence analysis and policy formulation should be rigorously maintained .
 They regard the policy process as a prescribed sequence of events with intelligence providing an important but isolated input into this process . They regard intelligence as an important and isolated input in this process, they say .
 This division of labor is believed necessary to preserve the objectivity of intelligence . The division of work is believed to be necessary to maintain objectivity .
 The intelligence community must distance itself from policy interests and avoid the policymaker's partisan pressures . Intelligence community must avoid partisan pressures from policy makers, says Sen. Ted Cruz .
 Intelligence officials risk becoming just another voice in the policy debate . Intelligence officials jeopardize the integrity of their judgments and risk becoming another voice of debate .
 Traditionalists say little direct interaction should exist between intelligence officials and policymakers . Therefore, they say, little direct interactions should exist with policymakers .
 Activists advocate a much closer relationship between the intelligence and policy communities . Activists say the intelligence community should be more involved in the fight for transparency .
 They assert that intelligence analysis and policy decisionmaking is an interactive process . They say intelligence analysis is a "interactive process" that is interactive .
 The evaluation of intelligence information must be carried out within the framework analyzing policy problems . The evaluation must be done within a framework of analysis of policy problems, he says .
 According to activists, knowledge and action should continually interact throughout the policy process . The activists say knowledge should be continually updated throughout the process .
 Intelligence officials should be brought out of their protected intellectual world into the real world of policy problems, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: Intelligence officials must be brought to the real-world world to help solve policy problems .
 There they would be involved in the various stages of the formulation and implementation of national security policy . They would be in charge of the National Security Council .
 Intelligence analysts should present their findings and express their views to policymakers . Policymakers should inform the analysts about decisions having an impact on intelligence analysis, authors say .
 Intelligence analysts need a general knowledge of the policy problems and should receive guidance from the policy planners . Intelligence analysts should receive proper guidance from policy planners in order to supply the necessary intelligence support .
 Policymakers should be aware of the limitations of intelligence support and how the available intelligence can best satisfy their requirements . Policymakers must also be aware that intelligence support can be limited to what they need .
 The activists argue that effective intelligence support suffers more when intelligence officials and policymakers are kept too far apart . The activists acknowledge that the objectivity of intelligence judgments can be lost in a close working relationship .
 An active dialogue between the producer and the consumer guarantees that intelligence information and judgments relevant to the contending policy issues are quickly and clearly disseminated to the appropriate people, says CNN.com .
 The key factor in this activist framework is the role played by the Director of Central Intelligence, writes CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 The DCI largely determines the direction of the overall intelligence-policy relationship with the U.S.
 At the highest level of policy planning and decisionmaking, the DCI is essential to assuring effective use of intelligence . The DCI will be used in policy planning, decisionmaking and policymaking .
 As the president's principal foreign intelligence advisor, the DCI can assure that key estimates and other crucial pieces of intelligence are brought to the attention of senior policymakers, he says .
 An activist Director must stay informed of policy priorities, press for admission into policymaking circles, and convincingly convey intelligence judgments .
 To carry out these responsibilities effectively, the DCI must maintain a good working relationship with the president and other high level policy officials . The DCI is tasked with carrying out the responsibilities of the president .
 The director should be someone in whom the president and his senior advisers have confidence, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com . The director of the National Institute of American Human Rights Act should be a strong leader, he says .
 At times, a DCI risks placing himself in an unfavorable position when his intelligence assessments challenge the premises of the president's policy, he says .
 The Director of Central Intelligence must maintain his objectivity in the face of adversity . To preserve the integrity and effectiveness of his role, he must maintain objectivity, he says .
 John McCone assumed the position as President Kennedy's Director of Central Intelligence with no experience in the intelligence business . McCone and JFK were JFK's first CIA Director .
 McCone did not serve in the Office of Strategic Services . Unlike his predecessor, Allen Dulles, and many other high level CIA officials, McCone didn't serve in OSS .
 During World War II he was involved in organizing and managing steel, aircraft modification, and shipbuilding industries . He was also involved in managing steel and aircraft modification .
 Following the war, he served in various government assignments, most notably as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission . He was also chairman of the atomic energy commission .
 McCone had earned a reputation as a forceful, demanding, but sensible administrator . McCone was known for his work in Washington .
 McCone could be a tough street fighter, but could also be reasonable and conciliatory . While he could be tough, McCone is also a reasonable person . McCone has a history of being a tough guy .
 As a high-level executive he was effective in organizing new operations, introducing innovative practices, and establishing clear lines of responsibility . He was effective at organizing new . operations and introducing innovative . practices, he said .
 McCone's views on national security issues were found mostly among conservatives . respect for his administrative abilities cut across partisan lines .
 He saw the course of post-war international developments as a moral struggle between democracy and communism . He also saw the future of democracy as a struggle between communism and democracy . He said he saw the world as an opportunity for democracy .
 Certain sectors of the American liberal establishment opposed Kennedy's nomination of McCone as DCI partly out of fear his hard-line anti-communist views would influence the Agency's intelligence reporting .
 Other opponents of the McCone nomination pointed to the fact that as a complete outsider, he did not know enough about the intelligence business .
 McCone defended his policy positions and outlined his concept of the Director's and the agency's roles in the policy process . McCone testified before the Senate panel acting on his nomination .
 President Kennedy's decision to appoint McCone as DCI in September 1961 was part of the president's overall shakeup and reorganization of the national security apparatus in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs fiasco . McCone was appointed by Kennedy in 1961 .
 President was looking for an able administrator on whom he could rely to carry out the changes necessary to improve the CIA's performance . President chose a successor to the legendary Allen Dulles to succeed him .
 John McCone brought to the CIA an administrative style much different from that of that of Dulles . McCone's administrative style was different from Dulles' style of the CIA .
 McCone was more interested in intelligence production than in covert action . McCone wanted to focus on intelligence production rather than covert operations .
 He focused his attention on analytical intelligence activities and the management of intelligence collection . The former CIA director focused his focus on analyzing intelligence activities .
 He carefully read the agency's daily intelligence reports and intelligence estimates . He carefully reads the agency reports and estimates of intelligence .
 His foremost concern was to keep the president up to date with substantive intelligence matters, he said .
 McCone was also interested in the technical collection of intelligence and in the ongoing research aimed at improving collection capabilities . McCone: "I want to be able to collect intelligence in the future"
 He did not want to devote much time to covert action, preferring to leave the day-to-day administration of those activities to his Deputy Director for Plans .
 McCone took his role as head of the entire intelligence community very seriously, he says . McCone: "McCone's role was very important to the intelligence community"
 In this capacity he was responsible for overseeing the production of national intelligence . He was also responsible for coordinating the community's intelligence activities .
 McCone was not afraid to engage in political battles with other bureaucratic chiefs inside and outside the intelligence community . Unlike Dulles, who tried to avoid bureaucratic infighting, McCone engaged in a political battle .
 McCone took measures to redeem the CIA's reputation in the eyes of the president and his senior advisors . McCone's actions were among the steps taken by McCone to improve the CIA .
 In the area of intelligence production, McCone directed his attention to the process of communication between the intelligence analysts and the policymakers . McCone: Intelligence analysts and policymakers must communicate more effectively .
 He wanted to ensure that policymakers were aware of the agency's intelligence judgments . He also wanted to insure that analysts were focusing their efforts on issues related to policymakers' concerns .
 McCone persistently asserted himself within administration circles. To achieve these objectives, McCone persisted .
 McCone personally saw to it that important intelligence reports were quickly disseminated to the president and senior policymakers . McCone was a key member of the intelligence community in Washington .
 Intelligence estimates and memoranda were put before the National Security Council for discussion . Intelligence estimates were also included in the president's weekend reading packet . President Barack Obama is expected to make a speech at the White House .
 McCone carefully made certain that key intelligence findings and judgments did not escape the president's attention . He carefully made sure that key findings and judgements didn't escape the President's attention.
 President Kennedy fully supported McCone's efforts and strengthened his authority over the CIA and the intelligence community . President Kennedy also supported his efforts .
 President specifically defined the duties of the DCI in a 1962 memorandum to McCone . The DCI's roles were as the president's principal intelligence adviser and as the coordinator of the intelligence establishment .
 The Cuban missile crisis was a dramatic example of the importance of sound intelligence judgments and timely intelligence information in the post-World War II world . The crisis was one of the most significant moments in the history of American intelligence .
 The performance of the CIA and other key elements in the intelligence community in this crisis demonstrated the direct influence of intelligence on national security policymaking process . The performance demonstrated the importance of intelligence in policymaking .
 By identifying the presence of the missiles in Cuba before they had become operational, the intelligence community gave the policymakers adequate warning of the impending crisis situation . First, by identifying the missiles before they were operational, it gave them adequate warning .
 The intelligence community carefully monitored the status of the Soviet missile bases . Second, after the initial discovery of the missiles, the intelligence community monitored the missile bases.
 The information they gathered kept policymakers constantly informed of the ongoing situation . The information helped them evaluate alternatives, making decisions, and managing the overall crisis .
 The intelligence support during the crisis was a community-wide effort . Intelligence was able to verify that the Russians were fully complying with the terms of the agreement .
 John McCone managed the overall intelligence effort but also became an important figure during the discussions and deliberations on how best to handle the crisis . McCone was a key member of the intelligence team at the CIA .
 The CIA's discovery of the Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba was made in the course of monitoring the Soviet-sponsored military buildup in Cuba .
 Since late 1960, the Soviet Union had begun a program of limited military assistance to support the Castro revolution . The Soviet Union was involved in the Cuban revolution .
 The Soviets provided armored vehicles, artillery, antitank weapons, and fighter aircraft . To assist the buildup of the Cuban armed forces, the Soviets provided weapons and aircraft .
 Cuban military personnel were being trained and instructed by Soviet military technicians and advisers . The Cuban military was being trained by Soviet technicians and experts .
 By the spring of 1962, the Soviet Union's military assistance program had enabled Castro to improve the force structure of all three branches of his military establishment . The Soviet Union helped Castro improve the strength of his forces .
 Cubans had not received any of the Soviet Union's most modern military equipment . The Cubans were not equipped with the most modern Soviet-era military equipment.
 By the standards of other Soviet client states, the Cuban military buildup by the spring of 1962 was limited . Cuba's military buildup was limited compared to those of other client states .
 It was not until the summer of 1962 that the Soviets began large-scale arms deliveries to Cuba . The Soviet Union began to arm Cuba in the summer 1962 .
 The available information on Soviet merchant shipping provided statistics on the number and type of dry cargo and passenger ships scheduled to arrive in Cuban ports .
 Thousands of Cuban refugees arriving in the U.S. furnished a hodgepodge of information on Soviet military deliveries to Cuba . The thousands of Cubans are now living in the United States .
 Some of their reports were accurate and reliable, but most of them were either fictitious or not useful for intelligence purposes . Most of the reports were either false or not reliable . Some of the most accurate reports were reliable and reliable .
 U.S. intelligence agents in Cuba likely to provide more accurate information on military buildup than that passed on by refugees . United States intelligence agents likely to be more accurate and useful .
 The tight internal security controls established by Castro after the Bay of Pigs invasion, however, made getting accurate or timely intelligence out of Cuba difficult . The tight security controls made it difficult for intelligence to get out .
 The most timely and the most accurate information on the military buildup in Cuba was obtained from U-2 aerial photographs . The most accurate and accurate information was obtained by U.2 .
 Since 1960, U-2 aircraft operated by the CIA had regularly carried out photographic reconnaissance missions over Cuba .
 In early 1962, as the administration became more concerned with military developments in Cuba, the frequency of these flights was stepped up .
 Surveillance included flights over Cuba's principal airfields and ports, and other areas of military significance . This surveillance included flights .
 The U-2 photography furnished the most effective way for the CIA to monitor military developments in Cuba . The U.2 photography provided the most accurate way to monitor specific developments in the country .
 The Cuban military buildup proceeded at a moderate but steady pace through the first half of 1962 . MCCONE'S SUSPICIONS: The military buildup continued at a steady pace in the early 1960s .
 By late July, an increase in Soviet military assistance first became evident in the changes in the level of Soviet shipping activity . The increase in military assistance was evident in late July .
 The arrival rate of Soviet merchant ships in Cuban ports during late July and August was significantly higher than it had been during the previous six months . The arrival rates of Soviet ships in Cuba were much higher than in previous months .
 Special security measures were being taken by the Soviets during the offloading of equipment from these ships . Also, human source reporting during July and August indicated that special security measures . The Soviets were taking special measures to protect their equipment .
 Non-Soviet personnel were evacuated form the port areas, fences were put up around the docks, and the equipment was unloaded at night . The Soviet Union was forced to close the ports and put up fences around docks .
 The U-2 reconnaissance flights were unable to detect the equipment as it was brought into Cuba . The equipment was brought in by U.S. reconnaissance flights in Cuba .
 A greater number of Soviet passenger ships had arrived in Cuba in late July and August . In addition to the increased merchant shipping activity, a greater number had arrived .
 Strict security measures were also implemented to conceal the activity associated with these vessels . The vessels were also equipped with sophisticated security measures .
 In early August he suspected that the Soviets were preparing to deploy offensive ballistic missiles on the island . The island was invaded by the Soviet Union in August .
 McCone apparently conveyed his suspicion about the Soviet activity to others in the CIA on 10 August,25 but not as yet to the president and his policy advisers . McCone said he conveyed his suspicions about the activity to other CIA officials .
 McCone met with senior policy officials on 10 August at a session of the Special Group Augmented, a group organized to plan the covert action campaign against Castro . McCone is a former CIA director .
 The available record of the 10 August meeting shows that McCone did not bring up the possibility of Soviet missiles in Cuba . McCone didn't bring up Soviet missiles .
 The discussions centered on the next phase in the covert program known as MONGOOSE . A week later, at a meeting with Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk, McCone discussed his thoughts on Soviet missiles in Cuba .
 Despite the lack of reliable evidence and supporting judgments from his experts, McCone argued his case with the two Secretaries . McCone argues his case in court with the Secretaries.
 McNamara and Rusk asserted that the building in Cuba was purely defensive . Rusk and McNamara said the building was built to protect the Cuban people .
 The Soviets felt it would be out of character for the Soviets to place offensive missiles outside of their own territory . The Soviets believed the move would be unusual for them to do so outside their territory .
 Without hard intelligence, McCone was unable to convince McNamara and Rusk . He says he was trying to persuade McNamara to give him intelligence .
 The DCI next met privately with Kennedy on 22 August to take up the matter of the Soviet buildup in Cuba .
 The day after his meeting with McCone, the president met with the National Security Council to discuss the Soviet activities in Cuba . The president met the day after the meeting with the president .
 McCone's conversation with Kennedy is not known, but it is clear that the idea of Soviet basing of surface-tosurface missiles in Cuba was on the president's mind .
 Kennedy, however, was not prepared to take any action solely on the basis of McCone's intuition . Kennedy: "I don't think it's a good thing to say that McCone was wrong"
 He instructed his intelligence production directorate to publish a daily special report on their intelligence findings in Cuba .
 The operations of the intelligence community would be run by his deputy, General Marshall ""Pat ""Pat"" Carter .
 Throughout August, the intelligence community was busy piecing together every bit of information to form a clear picture of Soviet Union's activities in Cuba .
 The U-2 mission flown on 29 August uncovered positive evidence of surface-to-air missile sites in Cuba . The U.2 mission was flown to Cuba to find out about the sites .
 Some SAM sites could be operational within two weeks, CIA analysts say . CIA analysts determined that the construction of the SAM sites was proceeding on a crash basis .
 They also expected additional sites to be established in the near future . They also expect additional sites in the future .
 The 29 August mission also provided evidence of other defensive measures .
 The photo interpreters discovered a cruise missile site in eastern Cuba and Soviet-made missile patrol boats in Cuban ports . They also discovered a coastal defense cruise missile missile site .
 CIA: Soviet shipments of military equipment and personnel showed no signs of letting up . CIA: The CIA's analysts cautioned, however, that the Soviet shipments showed no sign of slowing down . The CIA says the Soviet military equipment is still showing up .
 At this point he took no immediate major action in response to the buildup . Obama has taken no immediate action in relation to the situation .
 Cuban refugees continued to pour into the United States with reports of Soviet military activity . During August and the first half of September, Cuban refugees poured into the U.S. Reports of Soviet activity continued to rise .
 The aerial photographs taken through mid-September were unable to confirm the refugee reports of offensive missiles in Cuba . The aerial photos were taken by the Cuban government .
 The CIA still had no hard intelligence that the Soviet Union was turning Cuba into an offensive military base . The CIA had no evidence that the Soviets were using Cuba as a base .
 In the meantime, John McCone was in daily contact with CIA headquarters in Washington . McCone traveled to Europe to meet with CIA officials in Europe .
 He received telegrams on current developments and sent back cables containing his opinions and concerns . He sent them back cables with his concerns .
 DCI expressed his thoughts on the reasons for Soviet introduction of surface-to-air missiles in Cuba . In these so-called ""honeymoon cables"" the DCI wrote about the reasons behind the introduction of the missiles .
 "I couldn't understand why these surface-to-air missile sites were there, so useless for protecting the island against invasion," says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "I'm not sure why these sites are there, but why they were there?"
 The evidence available through early September had been enough to heighten the president's concern over the activities in Cuba . The evidence .
 He asked the intelligence community for its evaluation of the implications for the U.S. of this Soviet-sponsored buildup . The intelligence community responded .
 The Special National Intelligence Estimate is the latest intelligence estimate from the Board of National Estimates . The estimate is the first of its kind . It is based on the intelligence from the U.S. government .
 They assessed the strategic and political significance of the current military buildup in Cuba . They also evaluated the implications of possible future military developments .
 Kent's analysts believed that the immediate military significance of the Soviet military deliveries was to improve Cuba's air and coastal defenses . The Cuban military deliveries are believed to be to improve air and coast defenses .
 The pattern of the Soviet assistance denoted a defensive buildup designed to defend against an external attack . The pattern was clearly denoted by the pattern of Soviet assistance .
 The risk of confrontation with the U.S. over military aid to Cuba had to weigh heavily in the Soviet leaders' calculations . Analysts say the risk of confronting with the United States had to be considered in Soviet calculations .
 There were a number of weapons and weapon systems the Soviets might believe they could safely deploy to Cuba without provoking a hostile U.S. response .
 These included advanced jet interceptors, IL-28 light short-range bombers, tactical surface-to-surface missiles, submarines, and other naval combatants .
 The 19 September estimate did not overlook the possibility of the Soviets using Cuba as a base for their offensive missiles . The estimate was published in September .
 Analysts determined that such an action would be incompatible with their estimates of Soviet policy on such matters . They believe it would entail a greater risk of confrontation with the United States than the Kremlin had ever been willing to take .
 The intelligence estimate received no objections or dissent from the U.S. Intelligence Board . It was approved by the board, the approving authority for all National Intelligence Estimates .
 The State Department's chief Soviet experts, Charles Bohlen and Llewelyn Thompson, both former ambassadors to the Soviet Union, concurred with the estimate . The estimate is based on estimates from the State Department and two former ambassadors .
 The lone voice of dissent against the collective judgments contained in the 19 September estimate was that of John McCone . McCone was the lone voice in the estimate .
 McCone kept informed of the work being done on the estimate . McCone was winding up his European trip to Europe .
 McCone cabled his doubts to General Carter about the conclusions being reached by the CIA estimators . McCone was skeptical about the CIA's conclusions .
 The estimate should clearly state that the deployment of a surface-to-air missile system was an indication that the Soviets were taking measures to stop the American U-2s from detecting the impending arrival of long-range missiles .
 The day after this Special National Intelligence Estimate was released, McCone again cabled Carter and asked him to have the BNE reassess their findings . McCone asked Carter to reassess the findings .
 McCone argued that the estimate did not take into account the bargaining power the Soviets would gain by successfully deploying offensive missiles in Cuba . McCone said the estimate, as published, was not taken into account .
 Kent's analysts assessed the problem again but found no reason to change their original conclusions . Kent: "There is no reason for us to change our conclusions. Kent's analysis found that the problem is still unsolved"
 He did not take up the issue with anyone from the U.S. Intelligence Board . He says he did not talk to anyone from that board .
 The acting DCI, General Carter, kept McCone's exchanges with Kent and the CIA estimators an internal CIA matter . General Carter kept the exchange between McCone and Kent an internal matter .
 CIA incorrectly estimated extent of Khrushchev risk confrontation with U.S. Less than a month after the SNIE, CIA found that it had incorrectly estimated the extent of the threat .
 The failure of Kent and the Board of National Estimates analysts to predict the Soviet gamble cannot be ascribed to incompetence or carelessness, but rather to the constraints of intelligence gathering and analysis . The failure to predict Soviet gamble is not to blame for the failure of intelligence analysts .
 In reaching judgments on future developments, estimators worked with known facts and identifiable trends . The estimators used known facts to reach conclusions .
 As of 19 September, there was no available evidence that the Soviets were preparing to deploy offensive missiles in Cuba . No known evidence that there was any indication that the Soviet Union was planning to deploy missiles .
 McCone remained interested and involved in the production of national intelligence . During his absence from Washington, McCone was involved in intelligence production .
 Without stronger evidence he was unable to overrule the contradictory judgments of his analysts . He had correctly anticipated the Soviet objectives in Cuba, but without stronger evidence .
 He took his case directly to the president and senior policy advisers, he says . He says he was disappointed by the outcome of the White House debate .
 DCTs doubts that the Soviets would be so provocative that they would have been so provocative . While acknowledging suspicions, they all doubted that the Soviet Union would make such a move .
 The 19 September estimate, while addressing the possibility of the Soviets placing offensive missiles in Cuba, did not list this alternative as a likely course of action . The estimate did not include the idea of putting offensive missiles on Cuba .
 Had the intelligence community chosen to emphasize all of the ""worst case" situations, it probably would have warned of a possible deployment of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba . The intelligence community chose to emphasize the worst case scenario .
 The objective of an estimate is to reduce the uncertainty of future developments, not simply to provide a list of all possible outcomes, says the author of the estimate . "The objective of a estimate is not to provide all the possible outcomes," he says .
 From mid-September through early October, the U-2 missions over Cuba were severely constrained . The U.2 missions were limited to Cuba .
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk recommended changes in the U-2 mission program . McCone was in Europe for the U.2 mission .
 Rusk convinced the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance that the U-2 missions should be shorter and flown along less vulnerable routes because of the risk of a shoot-down from the SA-2 missiles . Rusk had convinced the committee on overhead reconnaissance that the missions would be shorter
 Rusk recommended that several flights should dip into Cuban air space . Rusk: Instead of a single flight across the entire island, several should dip in Cuban air .
 John McCone reviewed the previous month's aerial reconnaissance program . The previous month, he said, was October .
 He found that the western end of Cuba had not been covered for a month . The western part of Cuba was not covered in a month, he said .
 At a COMOR meeting, he argued that it was imperative that the entire island, especially the western half, be photographed as soon as possible .
 COMOR recommended a new flight plan on 9 October, cutting across the western part of the island . At McCone's urgings, COMOR recommends the change .
 On 10 October, President Kennedy approved the recommended flight over western Cuba .
 Robert McNamara urged that the Strategic Air Command pilots, rather than the civilian CIA pilots, fly the U-2s . The track was designed to minimize the risk of being shot down by an SA-2 missile .
 He argued that in the event of a hostile action by SA-2 missiles, it would be more appropriate for the mission to be flown by a military pilot than a civilian .
 With this transfer of command, the CIA relinquishes control of one of its most important intelligence operations . The CIA, in essence, relinquished control of the CIA, it's relinquishing control over the CIA .
 John McCone did not protest to the president. Despite his outrage over this loss of responsibility/John McCone didn't protest to him .
 After being grounded for several days because of weather, the mission was finally carried out on Sunday, 14 October . The mission was approved by the president of 10 October .
 The film was available for the National Photo Interpretation Center photo interpreters by Monday morning, 15 October . The film will be available for photo interpreting at the center .
 Previous human source reporting had directed attention toward the small town of San Cristobal where unusual activity was noted . Previous human sources had pointed attention to the town .
 In a heavily wooded area near that city, they identified equipment associated with a Soviet Medium Range Ballistic Missile unit . The equipment was found near the city of Moscow .
 Military barracks, missile erectors, missile launchers, missile transporters, missile shelter tents, propellant vehicles, and other missile support equipment were seen at this newly constructed MRBM site . Temporary military barracks were also seen .
 A few miles to the east of this site, the photo interpreters discovered another MRBM installation outfitted with the same type of equipment . The MRBM was found to be a few miles from this site .
 The photographs of 14 October offered the first conclusive evidence that the Soviet Union was deploying offensive missiles in Cuba . The photographs were taken in Havana, Cuba, in October .
 While these startling discoveries were being made, John McCone was attending his stepson's funeral . He was in Seattle attending a funeral .
 The process of alerting the senior policymakers to the new evidence began with the Director of NPIC, Art Lundahl . NPIC Director of NIC, Lundahl, has been in charge of the investigation .
 Lundahl informed Deputy Director for Intelligence Ray Cline of the discovery . Lundahl made sure his photo interpreters were absolutely sure of their observations and analysis .
 Cline notified the president's National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, whom he was able to reach at home at home . Cline said he notified Bundy, who is able to get to Bundy at home in Washington .
 Cline alerted General Carter, who in turn contacted the Pentagon's top intelligence and policy officials . Cline then alerted the Pentagon . General Carter then contacted the top intelligence officials .
 Cline phoned Roger Hilsman, head of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to ensure that senior State Department policymakers were informed of the intelligence .
 They were informed by telephone and word-of-mouth communications, apparently without compromising the very sensitive information . They had been informed by phone and word of-mouth .
 The timely dissemination of this intelligence was most remarkable given the fact that many of the senior officials were busy conducting business at various scattered locations, officials said .
 Neither Carter nor Cline brought the matter to the president's attention . Carter and Cline never discussed the matter with the president .
 Alerting Kennedy was McGeorge Bundy's responsibility, however, Bundy chose not to inform the president until the next morning . Bundy's decision to alert Kennedy was the president's responsibility .
 He felt that before bringing the issue to the president's attention it was necessary to get his staff prepared and insure that the intelligence material was in order .
 You were tired from a strenuous campaign weekend, returning at 1:40 Monday morning . You're tired after a grueling weekend .
 The evidence was presented to McGeorge Bundy and Robert Kennedy . They first presented the evidence to Bundy and Kennedy . The evidence is not believed to have been presented in court .
 Kennedy instructed Bundy to arrange for an immediate meeting of his top national security advisers . Bundy was the president of the United States in 1973 when he was assassinated . Bundy is the son of President Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln .
 This group of high level officials became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, or simply ExComm . ExComm is the group of members of the national security council . The committee is now known as "ExComm"
 The first ExComm meeting opened with a presentation of photographic evidence . ExComm met with a group of members of the public .
 General Carter, sitting in for the absent John McCone, introduced Art Lundahl . Lundahl began his briefing with the sites at San Cristobal . General Carter sat in for General McCone .
 Lundahl carefully pointed out the missile-related equipment that could be identified and evidence of the rapid establishment of field-deployed Soviet MRBM sites . Lundahl: "There is no easy way to identify the sites"
 Many of the officials present were not familiar with photographic intelligence and had to rely on the experts' interpretations . Many officials present did not know photographic intelligence .
 President Obama directed that only a select number of top policy officials be informed of this latest intelligence . The president directed that a select few of the president's top officials be told .
 Kennedy wanted a more comprehensive aerial reconnaissance program over Cuba implemented immediately . In addition to complete and current intelligence reports on the status of the Soviet missile deployment in Cuba, Kennedy wanted to see more of the program implemented .
 Kennedy and his advisers questioned why the Soviets would take such action . While discussing the appropriate U.S. response, Kennedy questioned why such a move would happen .
 In hindsight, John McCone's earlier speculation, which at the time had been treated skeptically, was now given greater attention . In hindsight he said, "John McCone" was now giving greater attention to his earlier speculation .
 McCone suggested Khrushchev may want to take measures to affect U.S. nuclear superiority . Dean Rusk noted that McCone had suggested that . McCone also suggested that some weeks ago .
 President Kennedy was convinced by 16 October that the Soviets were deploying offensive missiles in Cuba . Kennedy was clearly convinced by the time he was in Cuba that the missiles were deployed .
 The CIA and the intelligence community had been able to provide him with irrefutable evidence before the missiles had become operational, he says .
 John McCone was the president's principal intelligence adviser . He was responsible for providing Kennedy with the latest and best intelligence on developments in Cuba and the Soviet Union . During the crisis itself, he was responsible .
 He looked to the CIA for estimates on how Khrushchev might respond to possible U.S. courses of action . He also looked at the CIA's estimates on possible responses .
 Kennedy implemented his decision, it was imperative that the Soviet Union's military and political responses be immediately brought to his attention . The decision was made in response to Kennedy's decision .
 McCone used these meetings to insure that the current intelligence was properly coordinated, the latest estimates thoroughly reviewed, and the president's intelligence requirements promptly satisfied .
 The USIB sessions prepared McCone for his participation in ExComm meetings, which followed immediately thereafter . The ExComm sessions were usually followed by the USIB meetings . McCone was a member of the ExComm committee .
 NPIC's Art Lundahl also attended when important photo intelligence briefings were scheduled . NPIC: "Photographic Intelligence briefings are very important"
 Each of the ExComm meetings always began with an intelligence briefing that included the latest aerial reconnaissance photography .
 McCone would give a detailed summary of the CIA's daily report on the crisis . McCone: The CIA would provide a detailed account of the crisis in Iraq .
 Photography of 17 October not only revealed additional MRBM sites but also showed construction of intermediate range ballistic missile sites in central and western Cuba .
 IRBM launch areas were fixed sites that required such facilities such as launch pads, launch rings, flame deflectors, and control bunkers . Unlike the MRBM sites, the IRBM sites were not MRBM launch sites .
 Their construction would take longer than construction of the MRBM sites . The MRBM site would be the first to be built in the city .
 SS-5 SKEAN missiles launched from these sites could have hit almost all of the key targets in the U.S. and Canada . The missiles could have been launched from the sites in the United States or Canada .
 The photo surveillance program and briefings by McCone and Lundahl gave the president a clear picture of the size and capability of the Soviet offensive missile deployments .
 By 22 October, photo interpreters had identified six MRBM sites and three IRBM sites, each equipped with four launchers . By that time, Kennedy first publicly revealed his awareness of Soviet activity in Cuba .
 From 16 October through 22 October, the president and the ExComm examined all possible responses to the Soviet action . The ExComm looked at all possible ways to respond to the action .
 John McCone, in the meantime, reported an acceleration in the pace of construction of the Soviet missile sites, adding a greater sense of urgency to the ExComm deliberations .
 The danger of the Cuban-based missiles was in their first-strike capabilities, experts say . Experts say the danger was in the danger of their first strike capabilities . The agency says the missiles are capable of first strike .
 CIA reported on 21 and 22 October that although it was evident that the Soviets were working on the missile sites at a rapid rate, they apparently had not set out to make any single site fully operational on an all-out crash basis . The CIA reported that although the Soviets had been working
 McCone was asked to estimate the probable consequence of each potential U.S. action . McCone estimates the likely consequences of each U.K. action against Syria .
 If the U.S. accepted the missile deployment in Cuba, the Soviets would continue to expand their strategic weapons buildup there . According to the 19 October estimate, if the . United States accepted the . deal, the Soviet Union would continue its strategic . weapons buildup .
 If the U.S. confronted Khrushchev with the evidence and pressed him to withdraw, he was not likely to back down . Alternatively, if the United States simply confronted him with evidence, he would not back down. Alternatively, he might have backed down.
 Since the USSR could not hope to prevail in a conflict in the Western Hemisphere, it was felt that the Soviets would respond in an area outside Cuba, such as Berlin, where they had an advantage over the United States .
 Their response might include interrupting access to the city or a full-scale blockade . Their response could include a full blockade of the city .
 CIA analysts believed that if the U.S. used force to impose a blockade of Cuba, the Soviets would probably respond at an equal level but not provoke an escalation . The CIA analysts said the Soviets probably respond to a similar level but would not provoke escalation .
 A blockade, in essence, would not put the Soviets under any immediate pressure to respond with force . A blockade would put the Soviet Union under no immediate pressure with force.
 According to the 20 October estimate, the prospects of Soviet military action were greater if the U.S. used force against the missile sites or any other Cuban military targets . The estimate was based on an estimate published by the CIA .
 The particular Soviet reaction would depend on the type of military operation the U.S. conducted against Cuba . The United States conducted a military operation against Cuba, the author says .
 Two estimates reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union would respond cautiously to U.S. actions . Taken as a whole, the two estimates concluded that the United States would react cautiously to such actions .
 Estimates implied that a quick and decisive invasion of Cuba by U.S. forces would be the most effective way of resolving the issue . Insofar as Soviet response to a blockade versus some other form of United States .
 Any limited form of military action that was likely to drag out for a long time would not be effective in bringing about the removal of the missiles . Any limited military action is likely to be ineffective in removing the missiles, experts say .
 Such limited action would not put enough pressure on Khrushchev to back down . Such limited actions would not have enough pressure to pressure him back down, he says .
 It would put him in a position to respond elsewhere on a level that matched the United States action . It would instead put him into a position that matched that level of U.S. action .
 The estimates suggested that a blockade would only temporize the situation while preserving the inherent risks of escalating the confrontation . A rapid military invasion, on the other hand, would effectively eliminate the missile sites while minimizing the risks of dangerous step-by-step escalation .
 After several days of intense debate and discussion, the ExComm remained divided over how the U.S. should respond . The ExComm is divided on how the United States should respond.
 Suggestions include a naval blockade, a military invasion, and an airstrike . Suggestions included a naval blockage, an airstrike, and a naval invasion .
 John McCone kept the ExComm informed of the latest intelligence reports and estimates . McCone also participated in the policy deliberations .
 McCone neither proposed nor supported this course of action . Though his estimators had alluded to a speedy invasion as an effective way to handle the situation, McCone did not .
 McCone pointed out to the ExComm members that if the missiles were removed but Castro was left in control, then the Cuban dictator would still be in a position to undertake the communization of Latin America .
 A successful invasion might in fact achieve the intended objective of removing the missile sites . The U.S. has not been able to remove missile sites in Syria .
 McCone says invading Cuba would be a more difficult operation than most invasion advocates realized . McCone pointed out that invading Cuba was a difficult operation to begin .
 He favored more decisive action, aligning himself with the hardliners who advocated an air strike against the missile sites .
 President Kennedy called it a ""quarantine,"" being reluctant to term it a blockade . President Kennedy elected to go with a blockade as an initial response to the crisis .
 Kennedy noted that the blockade was only a first step and military action might become necessary . Kennedy said military action may become necessary if the blockade continues .
 On 22 October, in a nationally televised address, he publicly revealed his plan of action . The president's plan to take action was revealed in a national televised address .
 Shortly after the announcement, Kennedy ordered an enhanced aerial reconnaissance program . Low-altitude reconnaissance flights over Cuba were authorized .
 These missions sought more detailed information on the activity and equipment at the Soviet missile sights and other military targets in Cuba . The missions sought to find out more about the activity of the Cuban military .
 The lowlevel missions and the U-2 overflights provided the president with a continuous stream of detailed information on Soviet and Cuban military activities on the island as the crisis entered into its most serious stages .
 The president hoped the low-level reconnaissance flights would clarify the presence or absence of nuclear warheads in Cuba . A crucial issue was the presence of nuclear weapons in Cuba, the president hoped to clarify .
 The threat to the U.S. from Cuba stemmed not simply from the operability of the sites, but from the arrival of nuclear warheads at each site . The threat was not just from operability, but also from arrival of warheads .
 Kennedy constantly questioned McCone whether the warheads were in Cuba . Kennedy constantly asked McCone if the warheads had been there .
 CIA had not been able to confirm the presence of several new buildings suspected of possessing a nuclear storage capability . The CIA has not confirmed their presence .
 Low-level photography had not provided solid evidence that nuclear warheads had actually arrived in Cuba . The low-level photos did not provide solid evidence of the arrival of nuclear warheads .
 Kennedy and his advisers did not know if the operational sites were a threat to the U.S. Without such a confirmation, Kennedy's advisers didn't know if such a threat was a threat .
 Most members of the ExComm, however, assumed that warheads were present with operational sites now a real danger . The ExComm says that warheads are present with the operational sites .
 Khrushchev aware of measures being taken by Kennedy, McCone and the CIA . ExComm had to keep the ExComm alerted to any changes in the status of the Soviet military forces around the world .
 On 23 October, at his first intelligence briefing since the blockade went into effect, McCone reported that the Soviet Union had not instituted a general military alert nor taken any unusual military measures .
 Each day during the remainder of the crisis, McCone reported that the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc forces were not taking steps to achieve a heightened level of military readiness . McCone: "The Soviet Union did not take steps"
 Kennedy's next concern was Khrushchev's tactical response to the blockade . Kennedy's first concern was the response to a Soviet response . The blockade was the first time the U.S. government had implemented a blockade .
 Naval intelligence through the USIB and the DCI kept the president and the ExComm alerted to the movement of ships approaching the United States blockade .
 The CIA's Office of National Estimates has responded to a Kennedy request for an analysis of the effects of the quarantine on Cuba . The Kennedy administration has not responded to the request .
 At that point, McCone told the president that the Soviet ships en route to Cuba had either stopped or turned around . McCone said that the ships had either turned around or stopped .
 The intelligence community's resources remained focused on the areas of immediate concern . Many of the ships that turned around were apparently carrying offensive weapons .
 McCone continued to inform the president about Soviet military activities at the missile sites in Cuba and at the military installations in the USSR . McCone kept him up-to-date on Soviet naval deployments in the Atlantic and the Caribbean .
 Khrushchev publicly released a letter to Kennedy demanding that the removal of the Soviet missiles in Cuba be exchanged for removal of U.S. Jupiter missiles in Turkey . Kennedy demanded the exchange of Soviet missiles for the removal .
 Such a trade had been raised at an ExComm meeting earlier in the day by U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson .
 McCone disagreed with Stevenson's linking of missiles in Cuba with missiles in Turkey . McCone had been somewhat reticent during discussions on diplomatic alternatives .
 The DCI felt that the administration should maintain pressure on the Soviet Union until the missiles were removed from Cuba . Noting the importance of American commitments to the free world, the DCI said that the U.S. should keep pressure on Russia .
 Other ExComm members did not want to link missiles in Turkey with missiles in Cuba . ExComm didn't want to tie the missile in Turkey to the missiles in Cuban missiles .
 Khrushchev and the ExComm agree to ignore the public letter and respond to the private letter he initially sent . After a lengthy debate on the morning of 27 October, the president and the exComm. agree to respond to Khrush. The president of the Soviet Union and the president
 Khrushchev offered to withdraw missiles in Cuba in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade the island . In that letter Khrushche offered to pull missiles from Cuba in return for an American pledge not .
 The president was informed that a U-2 was shot down while on a mission over Cuba . The U.S. President George W. Bush was briefed on the incident .
 The loss of the U.S. aircraft was the first indication that the surface-to-air defense network in Cuba was operational . The loss was first indication of the Cuban defense network .
 The blockade had demonstrated American resolve but it had not stopped the Soviet military buildup on the island . The blockade demonstrated U.S. resolve but did not stop the Soviet buildup .
 In response to the U-2 shootdown, McCone urged that the administration should send a letter directly to Khrushchev strongly protesting this new act of defiance .
 Robert McNamara and others agreed that the SAM site responsible for shooting down the U-2 should be taken out . McNamara felt that continued surveillance was required . Khrushchev's recent demands for the removal of the missiles were also discussed .
 Secretary of Defense McNamara raised the possibility of an escalation to nuclear war in the event that a deal could not be made with Khrushchev . McNamara: The possibility of a nuclear war was raised in the hope of a deal being made with the Soviet Union .
 McCone suggested an immediate letter of protest to Khrushchev . At this point, McCone again suggested a protest letter to the Soviet leader .
 Some felt McCone's willingness to cave in on the Turkish missiles was premature . Some felt the move was too late .
 Ambassador Llellyn Thompson still believed that despite the increase in tensions as a result of the U-2 shootdown the president should respond diplomatically to Khrushchev's first letter as they had discussed earlier .
 President sent his brother Robert to see Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin on the evening of 29 October . In addition to sending the Kremlin the administration's response to Khrushchev's initial proposal, the President sent Robert to the Kremlin .
 The Attorney General wanted the Soviet ambassador to pass on a personal message from the president to Khrushchev . The message was made clear to Dobrynin that time had run out and the missiles had to be removed .
 His warning was nothing less than a threat to use U.S. military force against Cuba and the Soviet missile sites . The warning was a threat of using military force .
 Kennedy also pointed out that if the missiles were removed from Cuba, the United States, in due course, would remove its missiles from Turkey . Kennedy also said if the U.S. removed the missiles, the missiles would also be removed .
 Khrushchev ended the crisis by agreeing to remove the Soviet missiles and destroy the sites in return for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba . The next morning, the next day, the United States agreed to remove them and destroy them in return .
 Khrushchev agreed to verification under U.N. supervision under United Nations supervision . The verification took place under the supervision of the United Nations .
 Castro refused to allow U.N. inspectors into Cuba . Castro was unwilling to allow inspectors into the country . Castro, however, refused to accept inspectors .
 The U.S. relied on aerial reconnaissance to verify the dismantling of the sites and the removal of the equipment from the island . The United States, therefore, relied on an aerial reconnaissance .
 The Soviets agreed to transport the missile equipment on their ships above deck to allow the United States, by means of aerial inspection, to confirm the withdrawal . Low altitude flights covered the MRBM and the IRBM sites . Low and high altitude flights . covered the ports and logistics bases .
 Before, during, and after the Cuban missile crisis, the CIA played an important part in the national security process . The CIA played a key role in the Cuban crisis .
 The U-2 mission was marked by clear-cut triumphs as well as mistakes in judgment . The mission was the first time the U.2 team had been involved in the mission .
 Under John McCone, the agency directed and coordinated the national collection and analysis effort . The effort came as the administration's concern over the Soviet military buildup in Cuba increased .
 President and his senior advisers looked to the agency for reliable information on Soviet activities in Cuba . Events leading up to the missile crisis took place under a cloak of tight security .
 McCone administered a collection strategy that relied on extensive U-2 coverage over the island . McCone's collection strategy was based on extensive coverage of the island by U.2 U.S.
 Acting DCI General Carter managed the reconnaissance effort with considerably less vigor, deferring to the limited approach recommended by Secretary of State Rusk . During McCone's absence in September and early October, however, General Carter handled the reconnaissance efforts with less vigour .
 CIA's intelligence analysts concluded that the Soviet Union was sponsoring a major defensive buildup of Castro's Cuba . CIA: Based on the limited information available through mid-September, the Soviets were sponsoring the buildup .
 The CIA had not regarded the deployment of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba as a likely possibility . In their 19 September estimate, the CIA had thought that the deployment was unlikely .
 John Me Cone believed that the Soviets were preparing to deploy strategic missiles in Cuba . He warned the president and his senior advisers that the missiles would be deployed in Cuba in August .
 Kennedy, however, was not ready to act on the basis of suspicions and looked to the DCI and the CIA for hard intelligence . Kennedy was not prepared to act based on suspicions .
 The agency warned the administration of the Soviet attempt to establish an offensive missile base in Cuba in sufficient time for the president to take action . Once having obtained strong evidence, the agency confidently warned .
 Kennedy and the ExComm were able to assess the situation, weigh the feasibility of possible alternatives, and plan the timing of their responses . With John McCone providing timely intelligence, Kennedy was able to plan his responses .
 CIA estimates on Soviet responses to the possible U.S. actions helped reduce the uncertainty in calculating the outcomes of difference alternatives . CIA's estimates on the Soviet response to the United States' possible actions also helped reduce uncertainty . CIA: The CIA's estimate on Soviet response helped reduce risk of
 Intelligence reports revealed that the Soviet Union had not put its conventional military forces or its strategic nuclear arsenal on alert . The Soviet Union did not deploy conventional forces or nuclear weapons .
 Kremlin was not prepared to raise the level of the conflict, says Kremlin spokesman . Kremlin indicated that the Kremlin was prepared to do so, he says . Kremlin did not raise the levels of conflict, he adds .
 The president, therefore, could act boldly and decisively without fear that the situation would quickly escalate . The president could act without fear of the situation quickly escalating .
 The steady stream of current intelligence and the timely and relevant intelligence estimates kept the president and the ExComm informed . The ExComm added precision to the calculations inherent in the subsequent policy decisions, the author says .
 John McCone was the president's principal intelligence adviser during the crisis . He took measures to ensure that the required national intelligence was quickly brought to the president .
 McCone met with the U.S. Intelligence Board every morning of the crisis . He ensured that representatives of the various intelligence services were given the opportunity to present their evidence and assessments .
 McCone was therefore in a position to offer the president and the ExComm the best judgments of the community as a whole, not of just one agency or department . McCone: "McCone was in a . position to ... offer the best judgment of the . community, not just
 When necessary, he had to brief the president at the ExComm meetings, he said . President Barack Obama has been briefed by intelligence experts when necessary .
 McCone used his close association with the policymakers to make sure they understood the limitations of intelligence during the crisis . McCone, furthermore, used his . association with . policymakers to . make sure . they understood that intelligence was limited during the . crisis .
 He was candid in reporting that the intelligence community could not confirm whether nuclear warheads were actually at the missile sites in Cuba . For example, he said that he couldn't confirm whether warheads were at missile sites .
 McCone felt it was important that the president and his advisers not hold unrealistic expectations of their intelligence support . McCone said the president should not be held to unrealistic expectations .
 Having been included in the tightly controlled ExComm meetings enabled the DCI to present intelligence reports to Kennedy and his advisers in a timely manner . It also put McCone in a position to fully appreciate the president's intelligence requirements, he says .
 McCone used the USIB sessions to coordinate the intelligence efforts of the entire community . The President and the ExComm issued new intelligence requirements .
 He could insure that the community was focusing its efforts on the proper areas and asking the right questions . He could therefore insure that he was focusing his efforts .
 His was not a major voice during the policy discussions, which were instead dominated by the president, the Secretary of State, the secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General . His voice was not heard during policy discussions .
 The president and senior policy officials present at the ExComm sessions did not pay a great deal of attention to McCone's policy opinions, as seen during the 27 October meeting .
 The president looked to the DCI for his intelligence assessments and judgments, not for his thoughts on policy . The DCI looked to his intelligence assessment and judgments not for policy .
 McCone had no pretensions of being one of Kennedy's policy advisers . Although he would have liked to have been part of the policymaking elite, McCone would not have wanted to be one .
 Overall, McCone was not an activist DCI as defined by the activist school . McCone is not a DCI, but he is a former DCI .
 His involvement in the Cuban missile crisis, however, clearly went beyond the traditional role outlined by the traditionalists . His role in the crisis went beyond traditionalists, however .
 His absence from Washington during critical periods before and during the crisis and his relatively passive participation in the ExComm's policy discussions demonstrated that he was at times less than active in engaging senior policymakers .
 As an intelligence officer, McCone crossed the line separating intelligence production and policy formulation . Yet, as a policymaker, he crossed the lines between intelligence and policy, he says .
 He was persistent in dealing with the president and his senior advisers on intelligence matters . He did not assert himself aggressively within the administration on policy matters, he said .
 McCone was active in seeing that intelligence was promptly brought to the policymakers attention, making certain that the intelligence community clearly understood the policymakers' requirements, and assuring that the policymakers .
 Kennedy was confident that his DCI was providing him with the best and most accurate intelligence information . As a result of his efforts, Kennedy was able to make honest and objective intelligence judgments .
 In this case, once the presence of the Soviet missiles in Cuba had been verified, the DCI and the president had established an effective intelligence-policy relationship .
