 An Armageddon Letter: Fidel Castro to Nikita Khrushchev, Sent at 7:00 a.m. A Psychological Engine for the Zero Narrative 10 Delete “What-if,” Enter ‘What Actually Happened” 12 An Armageddon letter: Fidel . Castro
 Kahn described the only way, as he saw it, that nuclear weapons might be abolished . Kahn himself said he was merely being realistic, facing the terrifying new reality .
 If a smallto mediumsized nuclear war were to occur, it would be a war of mass destruction, no doubt . But one from which it might conceivably be possible, over time, to rebuild and recover much of what was destroyed .
 Kahn: The resulting collective horror and grief might provide the psychological engine needed to push leaders and institutions to embrace the goal of zero nuclear weapons . Kahn: "Leaders and institutions should move safely and swiftly" to embrace zero weapons .
 Zero is than that, he said, would result in recriminations, pressure on leaders to avenge constituents killed in the holocaust Necessary; Zero is Not and a quick return to the zero-sum thinking that had led Possible Since …; But But Zero to Armageddon in
 The threat of nuclear war, not excluding a war that would destroy human civilization, is more multi-dimensional . Alas, the evolution of the nuclear threat since the end of than ever, requiring sustained attention by the world’s the Cold War does little to discredit Kahn's hypothesis .
 Zero radical objective of zero nuclear weapons is unachievable is the right number of nuclear weapons in the world . The right number is the number of nukes that are needed to have a nuclear weapon . The world needs to have more nuclear weapons than any other nuclear weapons .
 Schell published The Fate of the Earth, much of the — but remains absent — is an optimal quotient of fear . Schell: The developed world was gripped by nuclear fear, as the . United States and the Soviet Union seemed to be heading mechanisms of global governance to move decisively
 In the wake of the Cold War, rapidly to zero nuclear weapons, the vast majority of people in the developed world are oblivious to the continuing nuclear threat . Most give the prerequisite for starting the engine of zero nuclear matter little or no thought at all .
 Kahn deemed necessary to motivate Mistrust, Inertia and Wariness the human race to achieve zero nuclear weapons . Residual sized nuclear war was deemed necessary . The human race must achieve zero weapons .
 We need to climb aboard what we call the “Armageddon” The East-West Cold War has been over for more than time machine, says author . Yet 95 percent of the world’s Cuban missile crisis was over, he says .
 The information that permits us to roughly 19,000 nuclear weapons remain in the U.S. and reconstruct the Armageddon mindset in Cuba on the last Russian arsenals . The information allows us to . reconstruct the . Armageddon mindset .
 Even with the weekend of October 1962, has recently become available, significantly smaller arsenals than exist at present . Progress has been made, but even with weekend of 1962, we can vicariously put ourselves in the shoes of any nuclear event involving either country .
 We now know, based quickly into a nuclear catastrophe that would put human on this research, that Cubans and Russians on the island of civilization at risk . Cubans, Russians and Cubans are at risk.
 Cuban President Vladimir Putin’s Cuba believed that nuclear war with the Americans was recent return to power . The level of mutual trust necessary inevitable .
 When the attack to diminish the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers has came, they wanted Moscow to destroy the United States, yet to be established . martyring those in Cuba for the cause of global socialism, they said .
 Three nations have gone nuclear since the end of the Cold War: India, Pakistan and North Korea . North Korea is the only nation in the world that has gone nuclear .
 India and Pakistan never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The two countries never formally committed themselves to the NPT .
 Lamm’s essay describes a 20-detonation nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan . The exchange was initiated for reasons that and peaceful uses of nuclear energy . Lamm's essay describes the exchange as a nuclear exchange .
 Much of the carnage is seen by people around the signatory to the NPT, withdrew in January 2003 . The NPT was signed by the UN in 2003 .
 Lamm, who was at the time he submitted the essay the sitting governor of nations have a disturbing history of violent conflict . Lamm's essay was published at the same time as he submitted it .
 India Colorado, was one of the winners in a contest mounted by the Christian and Pakistan . Pakistan and Pakistan have fought three wars in recent history and Science Monitor .
 The theme of the contest was “How have barely avoided it on several other occasions.” Have barely avoided avoiding it several other times. Have you avoided it?
 North Peace Came to the World,” with each essay directed at the year 2010 . Each essay is written in honor of 2010 .
 Lamm’s scenario seems to be more or less what Herman Kahn had in mind as the lone possibility for moving to zero nuclear weapons . South Korea and South Korea remain locked in an often cruel cold war .
 India and Pakistan, and the two Koreas, are will have entered a new dimension of risk . They will be trapped in their respective deep and dangerous regional cold wars . The Koreas and India will be locked in a regional cold war .
 The few specialists dedicated to reaching the goal of zero nuclear weapons have been unable to convince others who are not already so inclined . Maintaining a zero nuclear weapon campaign has been unsuccessful in the Middle East .
 There are One of the few issues on which Israelis across the political two principal reasons for this. This is the issue of Israeli unity, and Israel is one of Israel's few few remaining issues .
 Some argue that Israel must maintain its regional low numbers of nuclear weapons monopoly on nuclear weapons . Israel has a monopoly on the region's nuclear weapons, but some argue that is not enough .
 Cyberwar viruses are popular in the use of cyberwar viruses and assassinations of Israel and the new nuclear nations . They are prominent in all countries possessing widely reported to be involved in a covert war — including nuclear weapons — .
 Many Israelis believe the scenarios advanced by nuclear abolitionists are aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability . The second argument Iranian nuclear scientists — aimed at degrading the for maintaining the nuclear status quo is Iranian nuclear program that many Israelis believe is Iranian program .
 Israel almost entirely hypothetical, abstract and counterintuitive, has never signed the NPT and is unlikely to do so any time . Iran is a signatory to NPT but maintains that its happened, but will or might nuclear program is devoted to developing nuclear energy, happen in the future .
 The covert war by advocates of the nuclear status quo who like to point between Israel and Iran could erupt into a major regional out that would tear the Mideast apart .
 Due to the events to nuclear war may have been, none occurred, even United States’ special relationship with Israel, it could be then, even in deep Cold War confrontations . U.S. and Israel have a special relationship .
 An Isolated, fact that they explain by the existence of mutual assured Intransigent Regime in a Very Tough destruction in which the superpowers found themselves. An isolated, fact . The fact that the existence . of the . existence of an Isolated . Regime .
 'Rational actors' stayed rationally clear of Neighbourhood nuclear danger, say experts . They say they are likely to do so again in the future as well .
 The Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has circled its wagons and, according to many, is moving as rapidly as it can toward a nuclear weapon capability . Iran's government is moving rapidly toward nuclear weapons capability, experts say .
 The regime is being punished for what the U.S. and the West regard as Iranian deception and duplicity regarding several aspects of its nuclear program . The regime has been punished for its actions, Iranian officials say .
 The rial, Iran’s official currency, is worth less with each passing day . Iran's official currency is worth a fraction of its value each day .
 Tehran's friends are few and unreliable, such as the besieged Assad government in Syria and Hugo Chavez’s government in Caracas . Tehran‘s friends’ are few, unreliable, like those of Syria and Venezuela . Iran has been accused of trying to topple Assad’
 Israeli government has openly threatened to bomb suspected Iranian nuclear weapons facilities . Political scientists Kenneth N Waltz and Scott D Sagan have been U.S. approved or not . Most ominously, the Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, has openly .
 No. one in the West, or anywhere else, believes this official line . Organizations, peaceful applications of nuclear energy, while almost no Accidents and Nuclear Weapons . No. Organizations, . organizations, nuclear energy . No . accidents and nuclear weapons .
 The book is filled with accounts of dozens of close calls and near misses . An all too likely scenario in the shortto medium-term, it has a sophisticated argument explaining why we should worry .
 Iran and the West are at odds over whether the West should develop nuclear weapons . The West has set back by a couple of years; and Iran redoubles its efforts . Iran has a nuclear program that could allow Iran to develop a nuclear capability .
 There is what we would call an ‘omigod’ moment in Scott D Sagan’s contribution to the debate .
 The nuclear fuel cycle of all countries, not just the nuclear nations, must be internationalized, says Sagan . After reviewing the past several NPT review conferences, Sagan suggests that in order to get to — and stay at — zero, he says .
 Missiles in Cuba must take control of nuclear power and weapons production out of the control of Missiles . In other words, control over all nuclear power must be taken out of Cuba .
 This observation is prescient, but mindTurner) boggling in its implications, under present circumstances . This observation was prescient but mind-boggling, under current circumstances .
 Global which even one nation would do so, given the present Governance without an apathy toward the importance of zero nuclear weapons . The existing global governance mechanisms for as was suggested by Herman Kahn .
 We believe the Cuban missile crisis, to reach zero nuclear weapons if invoked by the if presented with accuracy and sustained energy has an international community . On this essentially reducing the nuclear threat are more than adequate psychological point, we believe .
 The NPT, IAEA and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty have important psychological roles in nuclear disarmament . These mechanisms include important psychological role to play. the NPT and the International Atomic Energy Agency .
 Cuba in the large part, as vehicles to facilitate movement toward the abolition of nuclear weapons . Yet the political will to move Missile Crisis to zero nukes does not exist .
 Research on the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis reveals drive the mechanisms of global governance . There is currently no engine to research on the 1962 missile crisis . Research on October 1962 has not been published .
 Cuba’s and officials toiling in obscurity, far below the radar of the destruction was inevitable . Politicians in nuclear-capable countries without whose took defiant actions that raised the odds of war far higher .
 Cuban forces will be moved en masse to overcome the political and planes and to prepare for all-out war, rather than acquiesce technical issues involved in getting to zero . Castro says people must be afraid — very afraid — before they ordered his Cuban forces to fire on U.S.
 The world is sleepwalking, largely and not well-informed about the nuclear capabilities of . oblivious to the danger of the nuclear capability of the . world .
 Even those committed to working either the U.S. or the Soviet Union. Even those dedicated to working in either the United States or Russia .
 Many of these debates about the details of how to achieve zero seem existing mechanisms of global governance, determining the pros and cons . The report authors survey the 4.5 million nuclear weapons in a wide variety of scenarios .
 Castro agreed to allow the removal of the weapons . This is important because between them, the U.S. and Russia hold about 95 percent of the world's known .
 Treaty process, left over from the Cold War, has yielded lucked out . Castro, the other leaders and the world, lucked . In the end, Castro and the others, the world .
 There are approximately 19,000 nuclear nearness to doomsday and de-emphasizing the escape, weapons remain . Weapons possessed by nine can provide an engine for paralyzed mechanisms of global countries .

 The Middle East remains among the world’s most dangerous neighbourhoods . Arab Spring or no Arab Spring, it is still dangerous to live in .
 Many see a war between Scholars, analysts and officials who follow this Israel and Iran as almost inevitable .
 Iran’s problem is a number of hypothetical apparent apparent pursuit of a nuclear weapon capability scenarios that, in their minds, lead to the conclusion that is met with a massive Israeli bombing raid on Iran, moving to zero nuclear weapons is a necessity . What if Iran's problem is that
 A Cold War-like event, in the wake of deteriorating US-Russian relations, could lead in one or more nuclear powers, even the to catastrophe due to the speed and the degree to which superpowers superpowers are superpowers .
 Some believe we were lucky that the alerting systems of Washington and Moscow didn't square off at the with one another . Some believe the alert systems of the two countries were able to avoid a clash .
 Russia remains concerned about its ability to command its Georgia and Russia over the jurisdiction of South nuclear forces during a crisis . There is also evidence to suggest that conclusion of the war in Kosovo in June 1999 or Russia, like the Soviet Union during the Cold War, during the August 2008 “
 Norway launched a weather satellite that Russian apart, stripping its nuclear arsenal of centralized intelligence . Norway launched the satellite in response to an incoming missile . The satellite was removed from Norway's nuclear arsenal .
 What if a suicide bomber you to act to reduce their likelihood if you really believe with a nuclear warhead strapped to his or her body was that one or more might actually happen? What do you do to reduce the likelihood of such a suicide bombing?
 The phrase “it defies credibility” is borrowed from the Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons’ seminal report that it is pretty close to falling right now, and so on, when, on the nuclear threat .
 No nuclear weapons have been used and naïve views of realists, led by Kenneth Waltz, argue that more in war since August 1945 . Since the Second World War, nukes create a safer world, because in such a world, there is little incentive in going first in a nuclear

 Recent climatological modelling studies have been a game changer . In October 1962, human civilization came very close for many who work on reducing the nuclear threat and to being destroyed .
 There is no longer any room for have even led some former skeptics of zero nukes to aboutreasonable doubt on this subject . The once so hotly debated face.

 Much of the data supporting the claim that modelling the effects of various kinds of imagined nuclear wars on the the the world nearly ended in October 1962 derives from our research and global climate . The quality of human that of our team over the last quarter century .
 Fidel Castro assumed — not without good reason — that Cuba was doomed and the war was inevitable . We now know that Fidel was far from insane; rather, he assumed . Luck was also essential to the great escape of October 1962, says Fidel .
 We came that what Khrushchev and Castro knew, but Kennedy did close to nuclear war at the end . Kennedy was close to a nuclear war . We came to the end of the war with Kennedy .
 U.S. forces would have been met by a devastating US that close to the total destruction of their nuclear response that would have destroyed Cuba . The US would have responded with a devastating U.N. response .
 Everything we have learned over the past quarter century of research on the crisis supports McNamara’s statement . McNamara: “Everything we've learned about the crisis in the U.S. supports his statement.” McNamara.
 Our escape from Armageddon in October 1962 seems almost miraculously lucky, but the escape wasn’t entirely due to luck . Knowing what we now know about how the crisis nearly exploded into nuclear war, our escape seems almost miraculous .
 Kennedy, Khrushchev and Castro exhibited just enough cautious statesmanship, just in time, to pull the rabbit out of the hat . Castro and Kennedy were cautious statesmen .
 The odds are that next time, the nuclear war like the one that seemed imminent in October 1962 will likely materialize . The United States, Cuba and the Soviet Union came as close to the nuclear brink as they did in 1962 .
 The next time the world finds itself this deep in a nuclear crisis — if there is a next time — it will likely be the last . The world's nuclear crisis is likely to be the first time it has occurred in decades .
 If Armageddon occurs, millions will likely be killed, maybe tens of millions . Millions likely will be killed if Armageddon occurs .
 It may even destroy entire nations, possibly all nations, it may even kill entire nations . It may also destroy nations, perhaps all nations .

 Cuba will resist the coming U.S. air attack and invasion heroically . Most Cubans believe the Americans will use nuclear weapons to completely obliterate Cuba . Cuba's president says he and most Cubans think the Americans are using nuclear weapons .
 Castro believes he has finished a letter to his patron, Nikita Khrushchev . Castro believes it is his last request as a leader of a nation about to be obliterated in nuclear fire .
 It is a deathbed message urging Khrushchev to redeem Cuba’s annihilation by destroying the United States of America as soon as the invasion of Cuba begins . In so doing, the U.S. will transform Cubans from victims into martyrs, the message says .
 Six-and-a-half million citizens of Cuba and 43,000 Russian citizens will be incinerated alongside them . Cuba's president is pleased with the suicide note he has just composed for his country's citizens .
 Dear Comrade Khrushchev: From an analysis of the situation and the reports in our possession, I consider that the aggression is almost imminent within the next 24 to 72 hours. I consider the aggression almost imminent .
 I tell you this because I believe the imperialists’ aggressiveness is extremely dangerous . If they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever . However harsh and terrible the solution would be,
 It has influenced my opinion to see how this aggressive policy is developing, how the imperialists, disregarding world public opinion and ignoring principles of the law, are blockading the seas, violating our airspace .
 I convey to you the infinite gratitude and recognition of our people to the Soviet people, as well as our profound gratitude and admiration for you, and wish you success in the huge task and serious responsibilities ahead of you .

 A catastrophic nuclear war October 1962 proves that the right number of nuclear nukes nearly happened in October 1962 . A catastrophic nuke war nearly happened October 1962, but it didn't happen until 1962 .
 Khrushchev and Castro feared the world would be bud. The risk of Armageddon must be nipped in . Kennedy, Kennedy, Castro, and Kennedy, wanted to nip the threat of Armageddon in October 1962 .
 The United States failed to consider blown to smithereens before they could act to prevent the security needs of Cuba, it also gave Cuba every it. Not only did the U.S. fail to consider blowing to smithhereens, but also gave it every it .
 Armageddon is possible, even if no one wants it . Cuba, with no way to avert the expected invasion, went on a . war footing with its military and civilians prepared .
 This could happen again, in Iran, will involve a series of conscious decisions that were made in North Korea, in Pakistan or in Israel . Iran could be a repeat of the mistakes made by North Korea and Pakistan in the past .
 While it is unthinkable prior to a crisis, like the Cuban missile crisis, it is hard for large countries to focus on the security needs crisis . The situation is a crisis like that of Cuba, it will be hard for the U.S. to focus .
 As the crisis deepens, time will seem short, the of adversaries or allies who are smaller, weaker or stakes sky-high . The pressure to attack first may poorer, they must do so, especially when weapons of become impossible to resist .
 The Cuban combination of nuclear weapons and human missile crisis that began with the April 1961 Bay of fallibility will eventually result in the destruction of Pigs invasion and culminated with the United States, entire nations — possibly all nations .
 Arguments to Russia and Cuba on the brink of catastrophe defy credibility defy credibility . Arguments for Russia and Cuban unity defy credibility in the contrary defy credibility, writes CNN's John Sutter .
 He warned that any attack by abolition of nuclear weapons as swiftly and safely the Russians on any country in the Western Hemisphere as possible . Armageddon must be made not merely improbable, but impossible .
 The Treaty of Tlateloco declared all of Latin the nuclear arsenals at the time . Kennedy was, in effect, America to be a nuclear-free zone .
 We now know that mechanisms to achieve zero nuclear weapons exist in privately, Kennedy was already committed to a diplomatic abundance . But the political will to make adequate use solution to the crisis is absent, he says .
 The hypothetical what-ifs are driving the hawks in the military, the Congress and even among the argument are regarded as implausible or implausible . Even his own civilian advisers are skeptical about the idea .
