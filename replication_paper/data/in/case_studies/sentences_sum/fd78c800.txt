 Robert F Kennedy Jr. Jr. was assassinated in 1968 . He was assassinated at the hands of President Richard Nixon . He died at the age of 92 .
 Two weeks ago the issue of negotiation with foreign enemies was brought to the fore by the hostile exchange between President Bush and the two presidential candidates .
 Bush administration rejects any negotiations whatsoever with presumed enemies . North Korea once it had developed the atomic bomb, such as North Korea .
 Obama wants to feature negotiations and has suggested in front of a Miami Cuban audience the possibility of negotiating with the present Cuban government a loosening in Cuban visitation privileges . In contrast, Obama wants negotiations and wants to talk about loosening of Cuban visitation .
 Both Bush and McCain have used the example of Ahmadinejad, the current President of Iran, as one example of a foreign leader with whom diplomatic negotiations would be impossible . This is contrary to the opposite recommendation of James Baker’s Iraq's Study Group Report .
 Most of the major diplomatic accomplishments since World War II have been the result of negotiations with putative enemies . Historians have also pointed out that most, if not all, of major diplomatic achievements since WWII have been achieved through negotiations .
 Kennedy negotiated with Khrushchev, Nixon negotiated with Mao, Kissinger negotiated with North Vietnam . Carter used negotiations between Israel and Sadat to resolve the Sinai issue . Reagan negotiated with Gorbachev to end the Cold War .
 During the last several weeks of his presidency, Clinton brought to the very final stages of negotiations an agreement with North Korea that would have terminated its development of the atomic bomb . In exchange for a variety of benefits, the deal would have been terminated .
 Bush abruptly terminated this effort much to the surprise of Secretary of State Colin Powell . Once in office, Bush abruptly ended this effort .
 Bush ended up seven years later with a much less advantageous agreement that conceded North Korea’s possession of the atomic bomb . As a result of the agreement, Bush had to compromise with North Korea in order to avoid a nuclear war .
 Bush and McCain diverted their argument with Obama to the pursuit of negotiations without sufficient preparations . Their memories refreshed about the history of negotiations since WWII .
 Obama had repeatedly conceded the necessity of sufficient preparations, so their argument was both uninformed regarding Obama’s stance and a dishonest shift in debate .
 Kennedy failed to hold his own in negotiations with Khrushchev in 1961 . Kennedy was the prime minister of the Soviet Union in the early 1960s .
 His embarrassment, in their opinion, was because he was unseasoned and insufficiently informed of diplomatic possibilities, they said .
 The Cuban missile crisis was probably the most dramatic example of successful negotiations since World War II, despite the lack of adequate preparations . However, in their litany of harmful effects resulting from Kennedy’s failure, they include the Cuban Missile Crisis .
 General LeMay wanted to bypass negotiations and simply bomb all the missile sites before the missiles could be armed with nuclear warheads . The USSR was beginning to stockpile Cuba with nuclear missiles, a large White House contingent of professional Cold Warriors wanted .
 In a crucial White House meeting, only one participant among dozens present continued to advocate negotiations instead . He did so based on his personal experience with Khrushchev, author says .
 Khrushchev won the argument and one last feeler was extended to the Soviet Union leader . Fortunately, he won the battle and one final feeler extended .
 This resulted in negotiations that led to the USSR’s withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Cuba in exchange for the U.S. promise not to invade Cuba . The USSR withdrew its nuclear weapons in exchange with the United States promise to not invade Cuba.
 Some consider this outcome to have been a defeat for the U.S., but it turns out to be absolutely important for our survival as a nation as we know it today . The outcome of the war in Afghanistan was important for the United States today, writes CNN's John Sutter .
 Many dozens of Cuban missiles were already loaded with nuclear warheads . Castro and Khrushchev had decided that if an air attack were launched against Cuba, Castro would retaliate with a missile attack on ALL major U.S. cities on the eastern seaboard .
 A major catastrophe was very likely prevented through negotiations rather than the use of a surprise attack that would not have been a surprise . Nobody knows, but a major catastrophe may have been prevented by negotiations .
 Robert McNamara’s account of what happened in the movie, The Fog of War, in which he recounts his discussion of the episode with Castro many years later .
 During this crisis, as much as any other time since World War II, diplomacy with a supposed enemy was of crucial importance . Diplomatic relations with the U.S. were crucial at this time of the crisis .
 I would suggest that we are up against a comparable situation right now in our relations with Iran, says President Obama . "We are not going to be able to live up to a similar situation," says Obama .
 If a bunker-buster air attack escalates into full-scale warfare, regional warfare would be possible throughout the entire Middle East from Gaza and Lebanon to the Khyber Pass and beyond .

 A waste of time from someone who needs to live their golden years in peace . Martha said on May 28th, 2008 at 11:15am
 As a general rule, if you’re in your golden years, stop pimping for Obama . Obama is in his golden years. Obama is not the president of the party.

 While President Kennedy was confronting the Soviets with his hard-line interception of Soviet shipping, the Soviets in fact did believe an American air attack had been launched . The Soviet commander in question did receive the order to launch against United States cities .
 The commander couldn't believe such an insane attack by the Americans was possible, and he found some reason or other to momentarily delay executing the order . But the commander couldn’t believe such a strike was possible .
 The Soviets discovered their error and effectively cancelled the launch order . And fortunately for the world, during this momentary break in the Soviet chain of command, the Soviets discovered it .
 President Kennedy’s decision to negotiate saved the world as we know it, writes David Gergen . Gergen: It was not President Kennedy's decision that saved world, but a Soviet military commander’�s incredulity prior to that decision, Gergen says .
 It was not President Kennedy’s decision to negotiate that saved the world as we know it . That is to say, it was not . President Kennedy's decision to . negotiate saved the . world as well as the world .
 President Kennedy stopped and searched Soviet Cuba-bound vessels on the high seas, in clear violation of international law . What us was a Soviet military commander’s incredulity at a moment when President Kennedy was stopping and searching Soviet Cuba bound vessels .

 McNamara in his long and chilling recapitulation of what happened in the documentary film, “The Fog of War,” certainly the most relevant turning point relevant to the issue of diplomacy was the choice of Kennedy and his advisors to postpone an air attack until one last feeler
 If the choice favorable to displomacy had not occurred, there would have been a full-scale air attack on Cuba . The pursuit of diplomacy was sustained just a bit longer before any planned attack, which could only have been catastrophic to the United States .
 According to Castro as recounted by McNamara, his role was essential. and he did in fact have an agreement with Krushchev that there would be a counterattack on United States cities if United States planes attacked Cuba .
 Lloyd Rowsey said on May 29th, 2008: Thank you, Professor Jayne, for the reply to my posts .
 Robert McNamara’s recollections in Eroll Morris’ documentary are more impressive than the written record of the Cuban missile Crisis . McNamara's recollections are more interesting than the voluminous written record .
 The US’s “pursuit of diplomacy” was preceded by an “almost-counter-launch” of nuclear missiles by the Soviets . The U.S. was more concerned about Castro's role in the Crisis than in the evidence that .
 Castro’s role is to be addressed briefly, briefly, and then a broader issue even more briefly . Howsoever, let me address Castro's role briefly, I say . Castro is a key figure in the Obama administration, but his role is not to blame .
 Castro was willing to risk the survival of Cuba to face down the United States . Castro took a harder line than Khrushchev took, he says . Castro and the Soviets first became aware that Kennedy knew about missiles .
 To placate Castro, Khrushchev agreed not to back down if a pre-emptive nuclear bomber attack was launched by the U.S. against the island . The U.N. would not attack the island if it was attacked by the United States .
 Khrushchev did not promise Castro that he would retaliate with weapons located outside of Cuba if Castro insisted . Castro agreed and was placated by the word, but it became an agreement without substance later . No Cubans were ever in control of any Soviet missiles in Cuba, and no Cub
 Kennedy’s first response to learning that Cuba had exercised its sovereignty and allowed the USSR to place missiles on Cuban soil was to impose a “strict quarantine” on Soviet vessels in international waters .
 This quarantine entailed stopping Soviet vessels and boarding them, which constituted a unilateral and aggressive violation of international law . This quarantine was a unilateral violation of the law, the U.S. government says .
 Any subsequent negotiations offered by any American representative to either the USSR or to Cuba were received under extreme duress . The negotiations were made under duress by the U.S.
 World already put on notice on April 17 of the previous year that America felt free to invade Cuba to accomplish ‘regime change,” was on notice after October 22, 1962, that America was capable of starting World War III if Cuba kept supporting revolutionary change .
 I for one find it hard to believe the Soviets were ready to be totally and completely obliterated on a bluff . The Soviets were not prepared to be destroyed on the bluff, says author .
 The United States had such an overwhelming position that the concept of MAD hardly applied . Back then, the U.S. had such a strong position that it hardly applied to the concept .
 Due mainly to the second strike submarine capability of the U.S. and the relatively modest reply the Soviets were capable of . The Soviets were able to respond with a modest reply .
 Edward Jayne said on May 29th, 2008 at 8:12pm # Lloyd Rowsey accedes to most of my assumptions in his attempt to refute them .
 Kennedy’s choice to persist in the effort to negotiate with Krushchev was highly laudable and worthy of comparison with the successes of all the rest of the presidents I mention who resorted to negotiations to prevent or terminate military conflict . So we have little to debate about .
 There is a similar list of cowboy aggressors in contemporary American history who are no less reprehensible in their excessive commitment to the military option . I might add that there is a comparable list of cowboys who have committed to military action .
 General LeMay sought at the end of the war to invade Berlin . General Patton sought to turn victory into a truce by extending the invasion of North Korea to the Yalu River . Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld staged a totally unnecessary invasion .
 John McCain’s militant posture in just about everything he says about foreign policy puts him in a second category of those able and willing to negotiate peace rather than engage in conflict and the threat thereof . What scares me about John McCain's bid for the presidency is that his militant posture puts
 "He keeps sounding like he believes I’m disputing the desirability of negotiating," he says . But for some reason, he says, "I'm not disputing it"
 Edward Jayne’s article congratulating historical JFK for having made one last effort to permit the Soviet Union to back down is mighty slim congratulations . JFK had established the public confrontational context in which that effort had to be evaluated by Khrushchev .
 Bush-McCain “no-negotiations” position is also insane, says hp . I surmise that hp considered it unnecessary to add that with Russia’s incomparably more destructive nuclear capability in 2008, he says .
 In his opinion, the electoral situation makes it virtually certain that American voters will be presented with a choice in November direr than in any Presidential election in history . In my opinion, this election will be the worst in American history .
 I would be surprised if Edward Jayne disagrees with me in this regard. And I'm not surprised if he disagrees with him, he says .
 "I fully understand the difference between the hot war in Iraq where Americans are dying every day, and the cold war with Cuba with its porous embargo," he says .
 I do not believe Americans will be able to accomplish any progressive goals in America or abroad unless and until Americans force their national representatives to end the war in Iraq . I think Americans will not accomplish any . goals in U.S. or abroad .
 I hope these points of agreement with Edward Jayne are different from acceding to most of his assumptions . I hope it's not the same thing that I would accede to Jayne's assumptions .
 Jayne’s article “Kennedy Negotiated – Lucky He Did” touched my two principal political concerns, and since Dissident Voice has been the main internet site where I’ve expressed these concerns, I felt obligated to comment .
