 Farming developed in a number of different parts of the ancient world, before the beginning of recorded history . The Agricultural Revolution was the first agricultural revolution in the history of farming .
 Historians say it's very difficult for historians to describe early agricultural societies in as much detail as we’d like . That means it’s very difficult to describe the early agricultural society in detail .
 There are none of the written records historians typically use to understand the past . Historians rely on archaeologists, anthropologists, and other specialists for the data that informs our histories .
 Our understanding of this prehistoric period has also changed — sometimes abruptly, sometimes abruptly . And because the science supporting these fields has advanced rapidly, recent years, our understanding of these prehistoric periods has changed . The science behind these fields is changing rapidly .
 Farming was once believed to have developed in the Middle East at sites such as Jericho and Mesopotamia . The ancestors of modern Europeans were usually credited with the invention of agriculture .
 Some scholars suggest agriculture may have developed more or less independently in several regions of the world . More recently, evidence of prehistoric farming in Africa, India, and China has emerged .
 People in different parts of the world not only making the same basic discoveries but making them pretty much simultaneously . But it was difficult to imagine how such parallel development could have occurred .
 Plant materials decay in the ground much more quickly than arrowheads and stone spear points . Even more recently, scientists suspect this confusion may reflect the difficulty of finding archaeological evidence .
 Some have suggested we may have been thinking about agriculture wrong . And some have suggested it may be wrong to think about agriculture .
 It now seems likely that agriculture began in a very gradual process that goes back much farther than we had imagined . Agriculture may have begun in a gradual process much further back than we imagined .
 Modern humans seem to have left Africa between 80,000 and 100,000 years ago . Humans as a species began in southern Africa some 300,000-years-ago .

 Ancient people were forced to follow the herds they hunted and to seek new food sources when conditions changed . Ancient people may have favored certain locations for long periods of time .
 Climate changed very slowly, but the cycle of glaciation was a factor in human development . The most recent ice age began about 36,000 years ago and lasted until about 11,000 . The cycle of ice age lasted until 11,500 years ago .
 This ice age displaced both animal and human populations . It also allowed some people to migrate to the Americas, as we will see . The ice age also displaced some people from the Americas .

 People probably began planting or transplanting their favorites closer to home, so they would not always have to go far, looking for food . People probably planted or transplanted their favorite foods closer to their homes .
 This horticulture or part-time farming may have begun before these ancient humans began to spread from the Black Sea area westward into Europe and east into Asia . This would explain the parallel development of farming across much of the globe .
 Various regions may have each developed their distinctive versions of what we now recognize as agriculture from a pool of common techniques . Agricultural techniques may have been developed from the same pool of techniques .
 Wheat was discovered in a region we call the fertile crescent, stretching from the Persian Gulf to the eastern Mediterranean . Wheat was found in the region known as the fertile crescent along the eastern Mediterranean coast .
 As cultivation spread and surpluses of grain were produced, civilizations like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia rose between 6,000 and 5,000 years ago . Mesopotamian civilizations rose as a result .
 About the same time residents of the Pearl River estuary in what is now China began cultivating rice in flooded fields called paddies .
 The three other staple crops of the modern world were developed between 9,000 and 7,000 years ago by natives of the Americas . We will discuss the importance of the three other crops developed by natives .
 The transition from nomadic groups to more complex societies based on agriculture allowed for the development of sedentary cultures which established governments, writing and number systems, and hierarchal social systems .
 Let’s look briefly at the ancient societies of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas to prepare for coverage of them in the early modern period .
 The ancient dynasties of the Egyptian empire developed along the Nile beginning around 3100 BCE . Built on the wheat surpluses made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile River . Ancient Kingdoms of North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean .
 Among the most visible achievements of the Egyptian empires are the pyramids of Giza, built between 2600-2400 BCE to serve as burial tombs for several emperors . The pyramids were built between 2300-2300 BCE and were the burial sites of several Egyptian emperors

 As networks improved, these opportunities decreased or at least pushed farther away . As networks improve, opportunities decreased, as did opportunities for networks .
 Adam Smith famously described the ‘Invisible Hand’ of market forces in 1776, but merchants were heavily involved in government in England and Europe . Merchants were involved in influencing their nations’ policies and regulations .
 Imperial expansion and colonial armies were indispensable for the spread of capitalism throughout the world . Also, as described in later chapters, imperial expansion was indispensable to spread capitalism in the world.
 In the next chapter, we will turn to the Americas and their discovery by Europeans . The next chapter will focus on the Reconquista .
 The Reconquista was a centuries-long effort by the Portuguese and Spanish to push the Muslim Moors back to Africa . The Spanish-Portuguese effort was part of the effort to push them back .
 The Portuguese Christians ‘reconquered’ more quickly, because Portugal does not extend as far into the south . The Spanish kings and princes had to contend with the fortified cities of Seville and Granada .
 Portugal also captured Ceuta, a Moroccan fortress in North Africa, in 1415 . Ceuta gave them control over the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic . Portugal also took control of the Moroccan fortress of Ceuta .
 The Portuguese were becoming 72 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford merchants and traders while the Christian Spanish were still fighting Muslims . The Portuguese became more than a century old traders and traders .
 Portuguese mariners followed the route established by Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco de Gama in 1488 and 1497 . The Portuguese began sailing to Asia around southern Africa around the continent .
 Muslims took advantage of a slave-trading network that provided possibly 10 million captives for Muslim slave auctions from the 9th century to the 20th century . They conquered coastal east African city-states, established colonies in Angola and Mozambique, and took advantage .
 Portuguese control of the African coast was one of the reasons the royal court in Lisbon showed little interest in Columbus’s proposal to sail west across the Atlantic to India . The Spanish were eager to take Columbus up on his plan in search of a route to Asia .
 In the wake of the Black Death peasants and artisans demanded and received better pay . Increased commercial activity in Europe in the late 1800s led to increased commercial activity .
 Gold and silver coins had been used in exchange in exchange since the sixth century BCE in Greece and Persia . However, economic expansion was limited by the availability of gold and silver .
 Portuguese merchants were interested in developing a route around Africa to Asia for the trade in spice and silks . But they were pleased to find trade in sub-Saharan Africa as well .
 Mansa Musa spent enormous amounts of gold in the Middle East during his pilgrimage to Mecca in the 1827 . The story of the Mali ruler's gold reserves was well known to Europeans .
 The Portuguese enquired about the availability of gold in every contact that they made in their explorations, and were not disappointed . The Portuguese were able to find gold in all their contacts .
 Present-day Ghana in West Africa was known as the “gold coast” by European traders and imperialists until its independence in 1957 . It is still second only to South Africa in gold production on the continent .
 As in most world societies in the 1400s, slavery was a traditional element in African kingdoms and chiefdoms . The institution of slavery was an important part of African culture .
 Captives were usually acquired through war or as for payment of debts, and enslaved for a period of time or even for life . Captive slaves were often acquired by war or by payment of debt .
 enslaved captives often gained positions in the societies that had captured them, and their children were generally born free .
 African traders were willing to include this human cargo in commerce with the Portuguese and other Europeans . Europeans readily accepted them as enslaved laborers and domestic servants .
 The trade of enslaved people, especially from eastern Europe, had been important in many parts of that continent even into the 1400s . The trade was important in parts of Europe, especially into the 14th century .
 We have seen that in the Ottoman Empire, the Janissaries were eastern European captives who were trained as an elite military corps . The Janissary were captured in the early Ottoman Empire and trained as a military force .
 The thriving economies of all of the Islamic empires, from Spain through Persia, also created a demand for enslaved people from Europe . Europeans were enslaved in the Middle Ages .
 The demand for enslaved labor was less in Europe than in the more economically-developed Muslim world . Some European slaves certainly served owners in the fiefdoms of the western Europe .
 Within a few generations, slaveowning ‘whites’ would consider ‘blacks’ to be only suited for enslavement . One can easily imagine how this would lead to ideas of superior and inferior races .
 The 1500s and 1800s was not the demand for labor in Europe, but on the islands of the Atlantic and later in Brazil and the Caribbean .
 The vast majority of the enslaved from Africa were used as forced labor in the back-breaking cultivation and processing of sugar cane . The majority of enslaved Africans were used in the sugar cane industry .
 Portuguese trade with sub-Saharan Africa coincided with discovery that sugar cane grew well on the eastern Atlantic islands off the African coast controlled by the Portuguese and Spanish in the 1400s .
 A Portuguese sugar mill, worked by African slaves, 1648 . Sugar cane itself was first developed in the archipelagos of Southeast Asia .
 Europeans discovered sugar during the crusades and developed a taste for it through commerce in the region . Arab traders brought the plant to the Middle East, where Europeans discovered it .
 The Portuguese and Spanish began cultivating cane on the Madeiras and Canary Islands, a European addiction to sugar soon began . Sugar replaced honey as the region’s main sweetener .
 More than two thirds of all enslaved Africans in the Western Hemisphere were involved in cultivating, harvesting, and processing sugar cane in Brazil and the Caribbean . Eventually, the majority of enslaved Africans were in the fields of sugar cane .
 Sugar was such a lucrative cash crop for plantation 76 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford owners . They would import enslaved Africans, work them to death in three to five years, and bring in more .
 The Portuguese established the first European colony in sub-Saharan Africa, Angola, in 1575 . It was south of the powerful Kongo kingdom on the West African coast . Angola is now known as Angola .
 The Kongolese royal family converted to Christianity and tried to negotiate as a peer with the rulers of Portugal . Afonso I, the ruler of the kingdom, tried to become a peer to the Portuguese .
 King Afonso was not able to prevent Portuguese slave traders from indiscriminately taking people with high social status in his kingdom as slaves . The Portuguese slave trader was able to take people with social status as slaves with high status .
 Only criminals and war captives were sold to foreign slavers, not the sons of noblemen and the king’s relatives . Only criminals, war captives, were sold .
 It is unclear whether King Afonso tried to ban all trade in slaves, or whether he compromised to avoid antagonizing his European allies . It is not known if Afonso decided to ban slavery trade in Portugal .
 The Portuguese carried off more and more slaves to their sugar plantations in Brazil . Either way, his ban was ineffective and the Portuguese carried on with their slaves .
 Iberians tried to claim that they were doing the Africans a favor by Christianizing them . The Iberian Christians tried to say they were Christianizing Africans .
 Conditions on sugar plantations were so harsh that slaves typically only survived a few years . Slaves typically only survive a handful of years .
 Their conversions were not so much to prepare them for a life as Christians, but to save their souls when they perished from overwork and malnutrition . So their conversions were . not . so much as . preparation for a Christian life, they were not . But they were prepared to die from
 Nearly six times more Africans were forcibly sent to the Americas than Europeans who went willingly . Over the next several centuries, nearly six times as many Europeans were sent to Africa .
 In all, about 16 million Africans were shipped to the Americas in chains . About 16 million African slaves were shipped in chains from Africa .
 4 million died on the way and were thrown overboard into the Atlantic . About 4 million of the 4 million people aboard the Titanic died in the disaster .
 Thieves are taking every day our natives, sons of the land and the sons of our noblemen and vassals and our relatives . They grab them and get them to be sold; and so great, Sir, is the corruption and licentiousness that our country is being depop
 To avoid it we need from those your kingdoms no more than some priests and a few people to reach in schools, and no other goods except wine and flour for the holy sacrament . And to avoid it, we need to avoid this we need priests and few people .
 We beg of Your Highness to help and assist us in this matter, commanding your factors that they should not send here either merchants or wares, because it is our will that in these kingdoms there should not be any trade of slaves nor outlet for them .

 Pray Our Lord in His mercy to have Your Highness under His guard and let you do forever the things of His service . Kiss your hands many times. kiss your hands often .
 As soon as they are taken by the white men they are immediately ironed and branded with fire . If they are caught by our guards’ men the whites allege that they have bought them but they cannot say from whom, so that it is our duty to do justice .
 Any white man living in our kingdoms and wanting to purchase goods in any way should first inform three of our noblemen and officials of our court who should investigate if the mentioned goods are captives or free men . If cleared by them there will be no further doubt nor embargo for them to be
 If white men do not comply with it they will lose the aforementioned goods . But if they don't comply, they will be able to get the goods back to their homes .
 Many of those who had been already confirmed and instructed in the holy faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ perish and die . The rest of the people in their majority cure themselves with herbs and breads and other ancient methods .
 We beg of you to be agreeable and kind enough to send us two physicians and two apothecaries and one surgeon, so that they may come with all the necessary things to stay in our kingdoms . And to avoid such a great error and inconvenience, since it is from God in

 Luther's Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation was published in 1520 . Luther's address was given to the German Nobility, the German National .
 The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them . All Christendom has suffered terribly. The Romanist have drawn .
 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford have maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal powers .
 If it were proposed to admonish them with the Scriptures, they objected . They objected that no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . The Pope was the only person to interpret the Bible, not the Church .
 They invented the notion that no one may call a council but the Pope . Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they invented the idea that . No one can call a . council but . the Pope, the Pope. The Pope .
 They have privily stolen from us our three sticks, so that they may not be beaten . Thus they have privally stolen from them our three stick, says the author .
 Now may God help us, and give us one of those trumpets that overthrew the walls of Jericho, so that we may blow down these walls of straw and paper .
 As St Paul says, we are all one body, though each member does its own work so as to serve the others . We are all part of the same body as St Paul, St Paul .
 This is because we have one baptism, one Gospel, one faith, and are all Christians alike . For baptism, Gospel, and faith, these alone make spiritual and Christian people .
 As for the unction by a pope or a bishop, tonsure, ordination, consecration, and clothes differing from those of laymen-all this may make a hypocrite or an anointed puppet, but never a Christian or a spiritual man .
 No priest could ever be made by the consecration of pope or bishop, nor could he say the mass or preach or absolve . For, if we had not a higher consecration in us than pope, no priest can give, says the priest .
 The bishop's consecration is just as if in the name of the whole congregation he took one person out of the community, each member of which has equal power, and commanded him to exercise this power for the rest of the rest .
 If a little company of pious Christian laymen were taken prisoners and carried away to a desert, a priest consecrated by a bishop would as truly be a priest, as if all the bishops had consecrated him .
 Every man can baptize and absolve, which would not be possible if we were not all priests . That is why, in cases of necessity, every man can . Every man is able to baptize or absolve .
 ‘Temporal power’ is as much baptized as we, and has the same faith and Gospel, we must allow it to be a priest and bishop, and account its office an office that is proper and useful to the Christian community . Since then the ‘temporal power
 Whatever has undergone baptism may boast that it has been consecrated priest, bishop, and pope . But it does not beseem every one to exercise these offices, says the Pope .
 No man may put himself forward, or take upon himself without our consent and election, to do that which we have all alike power to do . For, since we are all priests alike, no man may . put himself . forward, for example . No man can put himself aside without
 "If a thing is common to all, no man may take it to himself without the wish and command of the community," he said .
 If appointed to one of these offices and deposed for abuses, he would be just what he was before . And if it should happen that a man were appointed to a . man were . appointed to such a . office, they would be 'just what they were before,' he said
 A priest should be nothing in Christendom but a functionary . As long as he holds his office, he has precedence . If he is deprived of it, he is a peasant or a citizen like the rest .
 They imagine that a priest can never be anything but a priest-that is, he can never become a layman . They even imagine that . A priest . can never ever become a . priest .
 It must indeed have been the archfiend himself who said, as we read in the canon law, ‘Were the pope so perniciously wicked as to be dragging hosts of souls to the devil, yet he could not be deposed.’
 This is the accursed, devilish foundation on which they build at Rome, and think the whole world may go to the devil, rather than that they should be opposed in their knavery . This is a whole world, rather that the world should go to a devil .
 If the article of our faith is right, ‘I believe in the holy Christian Church,’ the Pope cannot alone be right . Or else we must say, 'I believe the Pope of Rome,' and reduce the Christian Church to one man, which is a devilish and

 It is time the glorious Teutonic people should cease to be the puppet of the Roman pontiff . The Roman Catholic Church was founded in Rome in 17th century .
 Because the pope crowns the emperor, it does not follow that the pope is superior to the emperor . The pope is the pope, not the emperor. The pope has the power of the pope to rule the world, he says .
 History usually began in 1492, with the Italian Cristoforo Colon’s ‘discovery’ of America . History usually begins with the discovery of the continent in the Italian .
 Columbus landed on October 12, 1492, to be a significant turning point in America . Even today, typical histories of America tend to consider the moment of Columbus’ landing to be significant turning points .
 Some continue to consider Columbus a heroic explorer while others regard him as a monster . Others accuse him of deliberate genocide . Some still consider him a hero explorer .
 In 1500, the populations of Europe, Africa, and the Americas were quite similar . The population of the three countries was quite similar in 1500 .
 European and Asian populations had substantially recovered from the plagues of the previous two centuries and were on the rise . The plague was the largest plague in Europe and Asia for centuries .
 Europe and Africa had about 80 million each . Americas probably had a total population of around 65 million . The Americas had about 65 million people . Europe, Africa and Europe had around 80 million .
 It's important to understand that on the eve of Europe’s encounter with the Americas, their populations were very similar . The populations of Europe and the Americas were similar when Europe first encountered the Americas .
 Reliable, storable, staple food supplies are a necessary precondition for long-term settlement and population growth . The pyramid of Kukulcan in Chichén Itza is one of the largest pyramids in the world .
 American natives built remarkable cities, especially in Central and South America . Like Europeans, Africans, and Asians, once they had created a reliable food supply, they built cities .
 By the time the Spanish arrived, the Maya were living in more separated independent city-states . The Maya were seemingly having abandoned some of their more impressive temples and structures such as Chichén Itza .
 More extensive surveying using recently developed laser technology has revealed that the city-states were never that separate during the Classic Period . New research shows that the Mayan area was probably more populated than previously calculated .
 To support such a population, Maya used raised irrigated fields, creating canals . More recent research has revealed that they bred fish to use as fertilizer, in addition to water plants and algae .
 In mountainous areas, the Maya terraced the hillsides to provide flat areas for planting . The Maya used to terrace hillsides in mountainous areas .
 Religion and governance intertwined in Maya society . Stories of gods and goddesses were fundamental in the building of temples and determining the best times for planting and harvest .
 Corn and the god related to corn were the principal concern for Maya religion and society . Corn was the most important religion in Maya society .
 They also developed a base-20 number system that included “zero” centuries before the concept was introduced into Western Europe .
 The preciseness of Maya mathematics allowed the Maya to be more advanced than the Europeans in astronomy . The importance of the stars and planets to their religious beliefs allowed them to develop a more exact calendar . The Maya were more advanced in astronomy and developed a more precise calendar .
 Mayan religious beliefs included scraping down and redecorating their temples every sixty years . The Mayan temple was built in the Mayan city of Mayan capital .
 One famous carved calendar used to calculate the precise time for this renovation and other key ceremonies ended on December 21, 2012, leading many to believe that the Maya had predicted the end of the world .
 In reality, it seems that the astronomers had simply run out of room on that particular calendar .
 Olmecs were among the first to form a complex society in Mexico . They carved impressive statues including large stone heads some 3,000 years ago .
 Tenochtitlan and Texcoco each had more than 200,000 inhabitants when they were first encountered by the Spanish, making them as large as Paris and Milan, Europe’s most populous cities at the time .
 Tenochtitlan was built on an island in Lake Texcoco and was connected to the lakeshore by a series of causeways . The city was built in the 1930s and is now located in Mexico City .
 They surrounded their island capital of Tenochtitlan with raised planting-beds called chinampas on floating platforms in Lake Texcoco .
 Aztec farmers used technique to carefully control soil fertility and watering . Aztec farming techniques allowed farmers to carefully water and fertilize their crops . Aztete farmers used this technique to control their soil fertility .
 Aztecs created a dike across the lake that separated fresh water from the brackish water of the main lake to the east . They drank water brought in via an aqueduct from springs in the hills overlooking the lake .
 The Aztecs supported six people per acre using chinampas in the fifteenth century . The Aztec used the technique to support six people a year per acre .
 Tiwanaku, located near the shores of Lake Titicaca in what are now the Bolivian highlands, was built about 8,500 years ago . Chinese intensive rice farming, the most successful agricultural technique known in Europe and Asia, supported at the same time .
 30,000 inhabitants developed a farming technique called flooded-raised field agriculture . They covered the hills around the lake with walled terraces .
 The Incas maintained and expanded by thousands of square miles these terraced farms throughout the Andes to achieve a level of agricultural production similar to the Aztecs . Centuries later, the Incas .
 The Inca capital at Cusco and its nearby towns and villages were also surrounded by terraced farms, many of which are still in use today . Many of the Andes were covered in terraced farm farms .
 Inca terraces were built and irrigated by hand at extremely high altitudes . Guano from coastal islands hundreds of miles away was carried in via well-built Inca roads .
 Many native cities have been hidden and their buildings and terraces torn apart by rainforest trees over the last five centuries . Many of these native cities were hidden and destroyed by the rainforest over the years .
 Machu Picchu is a smaller settlement located on a mountain peak about sixty miles from Cusco, Peru . Westerners were only encountered by Westerners in 1911 when they first encountered the site .
 The fact that it had been undiscovered by the Spanish provided a clearer picture of how the Inca had organized their settlements, with terraces for agriculture and buildings made of seamless stonework .
 Complex societies in the Americas were not restricted to just the Aztec, Maya, and Inca . The Inca was not only the Inca, but the Maya, Aztec and Aztec .
 In Colombia there is evidence of large ceremonial cities built in the northern highlands near Modern World History 93 the Caribbean Coast before the arrival of the Spanish . Other indigenous groups built complex irrigation systems in the lowlands just off Caribbean Coast .
 Muisca in the eastern highlands of present-day Colombia settled at a high altitude, around 8000 feet above sea level . The Muiscoa settled at the highest altitude in the region .
 They cultivated corn and quinoa on the extensive flatland valleys between the mountains . They controlled extensive salt deposits, and traded salt for gold, emeralds, fruits and other lowland products with neighboring indigenous groups .
 Their architecture was impressive, but built with massive tree trunks rather than stone, so that no examples survived the Spanish conquest .
 The Muisca did not develop a writing system like the Maya and Aztecs, but maintained religious rituals and beliefs focused on ancestor worship and the sacredness of their kings .
 Each year, at a round ceremonial lake outside of present-day Bogota, the Muisca king powdered himself in gold dust and dove into the waters as a purification rite for the gods .
 This practice is the origin of the myth of El Dorado, the “Golden Man,’ sought by the Spanish in their early explorations . The practice is believed to have led to the creation of the "Golden Man"
 Spaniards came to believe they were searching for a city of gold, which they never found . Over time, Spaniards such as Coronado came to think they were looking for gold .
 The natives of North America also settled in complex societies in various regions, based mainly on the cultivation of corn, wild rice, squash, and pumpkins . They managed the environment to promote the success of game animals .
 The traditional United States and Canadian Thanksgiving dinner celebrates the native foods of North America, including the turkey . The traditional U.S. Thanksgiving dinner is served in Canada and Canada .
 Along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, indigenous people lived mostly in villages . They gathered into cities and built mounds like those found at Cahokia . Cahokia is one of the largest mounds in the Mississippi .
 By the time of contact 94 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford with Europeans, the Iroquois had formed a confederacy of five major tribes . The Iroquese had formed an alliance of five tribes .
 The Ojibwe and Dakota were also semi-sedentary, living in settlements in the western Great Lakes region and on the edge of the northern Great Plains . The Dakota and Ojiibwe also lived in settlements on the Great Plains region .
 By the time of contact with the Europeans, the Dakota dominated the Plains . They took advantage of the large herds of buffalo as a source of protein, clothing, and housing, while gathering wild rice .
 Many North American forest-dwellers developed the sap of the maple tree as a key source of sugar . The maple tree's sap is used to make sugar .
 Of course, all this agriculture and city-building and civilization was happening in the Americas without anyone in Europe, Asia, or Africa knowing about it .
 Some Europeans believed the world was flat until Columbus came along . Europeans were unclear on the actual size of the Earth and the existence of American continents and the Pacific Ocean .
 Not all Europeans were unaware there was something valuable across the Atlantic . But not all Europeans are unaware there is something valuable in America .
 It’s important to realize that European exploration did not BEGIN with Columbus . European exploration began with Columbus, not Columbus .
 Around 1000 CE, five hundred years before the Italian explorer set out to discover a new trade route to Asia for Spain, Norse explorers from Europe and Iceland established a presence on Greenland .
 Greenland colony lasted four hundred years and was base for exploration and settlement even further west . Greenland colony was base to explore further west and was a base for settlement further west.
 Leif Erikson, son of Greenland colony’s leader Erik the Red, began a colony in what is now northern Newfoundland . Leif began colony in Greenland in 1877 .
 For a long time, historians thought Scandinavian claims about a North American colony called Vinland were just patriotic folktales . Modern World History 95 is a look at the history of the Vinland colony .
 Vikings visited by Vikings faced strenuous opposition from natives they called Skraelings, who according to the Viking sagas were fierce warriors . Vikings also faced opposition from the Skraeling, who are said to be fierce warriors in the area .
 Map made in Iceland in 1570 identifies the area at the latitude of Newfoundland as Skralinge Land .
 Greenland map from 1747 shows a channel believed to have once cut through the island . Viking settlements were thought to have been located on the Greenland coast .
 Textbooks tend to stress European desire for gold and silver, and finding precious metals was very important to explorers like the conquistadors . Finding precious metals is important to European explorers, and it was important to find gold .
 We shouldn't underestimate Europeans' fear of famine, especially during the Little Ice Age . But we shouldn’t underestimate Europeans’ fear of hunger, especially in Europe .
 Even before Columbus’s voyage, Basque and Portuguese fishermen regularly visited the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland to catch cod .
 A 1497 account by Giovanni Caboto (another Italian explorer who anglicized his name to John Cabot) claimed cod were so plentiful on the coast of North America that European fishermen could walk from ship to ship on their backs .
 Salted cod is still an important element of traditional Portuguese cuisine . Nowadays they get their fish from Norway, although nowadays they get it from Norway .
 The fisheries were originally a closelyguarded trade secret, but by the time Columbus made his famous journey they were well-known . Since cod was usually dried on racks onshore before being carried back to Europe .
 Columbus’s promise to find a sea-route to Asia interested European monarchs like Ferdinand and Isabella . Landbased trade routes to Asia were becoming more difficult and expensive . Columbus's promise was important to monarchs .
 The collapse of the Mongol Empire at the end of the thirteenth century and the plagues of the fourteenth century increased the perceived danger of overland travel . Overland travel is still a popular topic in the world .
 Columbus had failed to interest Portugal in his proposal, because Bartolomeu Dias had already discovered a route to Asia around the bottom of Africa . Dias discovered the route in 1783 .
 Spain had recently unified with the marriage of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castille . Spain had just completed the Reconquista and ejected Muslims from Granada, their last kingdom on the Iberian peninsula .
 Dan Allosso and Tom Williford the New World . Their war on behalf of religion and glory would continue in 98 . Their efforts would continue .
 The sternpost rudder, the compass, gunpowder, and the printing press were all Chinese inventions that found their way to Europe over an already-existing international trade network dominated by Arab merchants . It was about to become truly global with the European encounter of the Americas .
 Columbus arrived in the Caribbean on October 12, 1492, and explored until late December . Columbus explored the Caribbean in 1492 .
 His flagship, the Santa Maria, ran aground on Hispaniola on December 25 and had to be abandoned . The Santa Maria was the first ship to run aground in the past .
 Columbus left 39 sailors behind in a settlement he named La Navidad . With permission of the local chief, he left 39 men behind in the settlement he left behind .
 He returned to Europe with two ships, a few captive Taino natives, some gold, and specimens of New World species including turkeys and pineapple .
 Columbus wanted very badly to be sent back again . But this document was the explorer’s report to his royal sponsors, and Columbus wanted to return .
 Columbus was reporting on lands previously unknown to Europeans . He got his readers excited about the places he had visited . Whether or not he understood he was reporting, Columbus got readers excited .
 Third voyage —– BS zh zh ‘ourth voyage’ When other European explorers reached America they were equally amazed . Third voyage .
 Amerigo Vespucci’s 1504 best-seller, Mundus Novus, coined the term New World . The lands were not Asia but a previously unknown continent . Amerigo's account made it clear for anyone still confused .
 Like Columbus, the explorers carried back to Europe not only eyewitness accounts of wealthy civilizations, but samples of native plants, animals, and captive people . The explorers returned to Europe with eyewitness accounts and samples of rich civilizations .
 Other old-world crops that thrived in the Americas included coffee and bananas, originally cultivated in Africa and Asia, which were brought from the Canary Islands in 1516 .
 The Spanish had introduced sugar cultivation to the Canary Islands in the early fifteenth century .
 Even species like the wild horses of the American West that would transform Plains Indian culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were the descendants of escapees from the herds of the conquistadors .
 The Americas had very few large mammal species, and most could not be domesticated . Most of the species were not domesticated and could not survive domestication . The Americas were home to very few mammal species .
 Nearly all of the species humans have successfully domesticated, the familiar residents of the modern farmyard, originated in Europe and Asia .
 The Spanish and Portuguese dominated the first century of exploration, conquest and colonization in the Americas for many reasons .
 Spain and Portugal had an eight-century long tradition of warfare from fighting the Reconquista against the Moors, and were prepared for further battle for glory and religion .
 The Portuguese also had a maritime tradition, which was how Columbus learned his trade . The Portuguese are known for their maritime tradition .
 The Spanish and Portuguese were granted a license by the Pope under the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas . The treaty awarded all the territory east of the 47th meridian to Portugal and everything west of it to Spain .
 The Pope who made the deal was a Spaniard named Rodrigo Borja . His reign was known for nepotism and corruption . Despite a pledge of clerical celibacy, he was the father of the Borgias .
 The Portuguese received the east, because they were already establishing colonies on the east and west coasts of Africa . The Portuguese had already established colonies on both coasts .
 The Spanish were assigned the unknown west, which turned out to be bigger than anyone had expected . The Spanish had been assigned the Spanish to the west, but it was bigger than expected .
 This type of corruption at the Vatican helped motivate reformers like Martin Luther toward what became the Protestant Reformation . Martin Luther was inspired by the Vatican corruption .
 Historians call the transfer of plants and animals that began with the encounter between Europe and the Americas after 1492 the Columbian Exchange . The exchange began in 1492 .
 The directions of these biological transfers and their effects on the environments and people of Europe and the Americas shaped the modern world we live in .
 American maize, potatoes, and cassava fed growing European, African, and Asian populations . It allowed the building of new cities and industries . American maize and potatoes fed growing African, Asian, European populations .
 European animals such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and cattle thrived in the Americas . Native Americans and Europeans added animal protein to their diets and eventually expanded their populations .
 When prehistoric Eurasians began living in close contact with the species they domesticated, the people were affected almost as much as the animals they kept . People were affected by the contact of domesticated animals .
 Most of humanity’s major diseases originated in animals and crossed from domesticated species to their human keepers . Most of the major diseases originate in animals, such as most of humanity's major diseases .
 Whooping cough and influenza came from pigs; measles and smallpox from cattle; malaria and avian flu from chickens . Smallpox came from cattle, whooping cough from pigs, measles from cattle and measles .
 The people who domesticated these species and lived with the animals for generations co-evolved with them . People who lived with these species lived with them for generations lived in the same way .
 Animal diseases became survivable when people developed antibodies and immunity . People developed antibodies to protect against animal diseases . Animal diseases were survivable if people developed immunity .
 Even a routine childhood disease such as chickenpox was initially devastating for Native Americans . Native Americans did not have domesticated animals and thus little acquired immunity to these diseases . Without the inherited protection enjoyed by most Eurasians and Africans, most Eurasian and African Americans suffered from chickenpox .
 The introduction of a disease into an area without inherited immunity is called a virgin soil epidemic . Introducing a new disease into a new area is known as virgin soil .
 The Black Death killed probably half the population of Europe in the fourteenth century, reducing world population by about a hundred million . Such epidemics had happened in Eurasia, when the Romans spread smallpox into the populations they conquered, and in Europe when the expanding Mongols introduced bubonic
 Virgin soil epidemics spread across the Americas when explorers and colonists introduced Eurasian diseases to the Native Americans . The diseases were introduced to Native Americans by explorers, colonists .
 Eurasian diseases that attacked native populations included smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenza, cholera, typhus, typhoid, diphtheria, bubonic plague, scarlet fever, scarlett fever, whooping cough, and malaria .
 Even the Black Death did not kill as large a percentage of Europeans, and when diseases recurred in Europe, they generally killed their suffering from smallpox victims over a much longer time-span due to the inherited immunity of European populations . European depiction of Aztecs depicted as Azte
 American native populations had no such safeguards, and disease spread virulently . Disease spread virulently across the United States .
 There were over a million people living on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1492 . Columbus left his 39 sailors in La Navidad when he left the island .
 The populations of other Caribbean islands like Cuba were similarly wiped out . The populations were wiped out in the 1990s .
 Whole societies disappeared, and this was not only for the cultures that vanished, it was also a tragedy for the culture that vanished . Whole societies disappear, and that's not only a tragedy, but also for the people who lost their lives .
 Reduction of native populations began a cycle of violence that became central to the history of the Americas . The reduction of native population began to be a cycle that began in the 1800s .
 The greater population densities of Central and South America enabled contagious diseases to spread more quickly there . The greater number of people in the region is believed to have contributed to the spread of contagious diseases .
 Heavily-traveled roads in central Mexico actually helped spread disease beyond areas reached by Spanish explorers . The roads in the region were used to carry out disease .
 The population of the Aztec heartland dropped from 25 million on the eve of the Spanish conquest in 1519 to just under 17 million a decade later . The population dropped from about 25 million to about 17 million in the 15th century .

 Depopulation of the Americas is one of the Earth’s most significant population disasters, both in its human toll and in the changes it brought about . The depopulation was one of humanity's most devastating population disasters .
 There has been a lot of controversy about what happened . Over the years, aS you might expect, there has been plenty of controversy over what happened.
 To defend themselves, colonialists accused the Aztec and Inca Empires with atrocities of their own . Colonialists have emphasized the support conquistadors received from indigenous rivals .
 Textbooks often reflect some of these biases, one says between 20,000 and 80,000 men, women, and children were slaughtered in a single ceremony in 1487 .
 Over 20 million people died after the Spanish invasion of the Aztec lands of Central Mexico . This claim may not be true .
 Traditional European or Eurocentric American histories of exploration often present the victory of the 1550 illustration shows Cortés meeting Spanish over the aments AZiee as an example of the superiority of Europeans over the savage Indians .
 Cortes encountered a region simmering with native conflict in central Mexico . Cortes explored central Mexico, exploring the region in search of the Americas .
 Many peoples in Mexico resented the overlords of Tenochtitlan and were ready to rebel . Far from being unified and content under Aztec rule, many resented their overlords . The Aztec people were not content with Aztec's rule and wanted independence .
 Cortés was aided by an enslaved Nahua woman, Malintzin , whom the natives of Tabasco gave him as a tribute slave . Cortés also aided by a woman who was given as a slave by the natives .
 Malintzin quickly learned Spanish and translated for Cortés in his dealings with Aztec emperor Moctezuma . In addition to speaking Nahua and Maya, he also learned Spanish .
 Their son, Martin, was one of the first ‘mestizos’ (persons of mixed indigenous American and European descent) in Spanish America . Their son was a "mestizo," a person of indigenous and European American and Spanish descent .
 Malintzin remains a controversial figure in the history of the Atlantic World . He remains controversial in the modern world .
 She demonstrates one way in which native peoples responded to the arrival of the Spanish . In either case, she demonstrates how native peoples reacted to the Spanish arrival .
 Without the language bridge, Cortés would not have been able to communicate . Cortés was less successful in destabilizing the Aztec Empire . Without her she would have been less successful .
 Native people helped shape the conquest of the Americas . By this and other means, native people help shape the continent's history .
 The Inca Empire in the Andes suffered the same fate . 90% of the South Americans died, and they started dying BEFORE the white invaders arrived in 1582, which caused confusion .
 When Pizarro crossed the Andes with eighty conquistadors, he found social chaos . The conquistador crossed the mountains in search of a new home .

 French explorer reported traveling hundreds of miles without passing a single village . The explorer reported to have traveled without passing any village .
 Historians were unaware until recently that the American South had once been heavily populated before the arrival of contagious Spanish explorers and missionaries .
 Spanish invaders had not deliberately infected the natives with all these diseases . They were quick to take advantage of the social chaos and military weakness of native societies .
 In both Mexico and Peru, the conquistadors found allies among different indigenous groups . Indigenous groups often thought of themselves as the victors, with Spanish help, rather than the other way around .
 Spaniards took over the capital cities of the Inca and Aztec empires . They inserted themselves into the top positions in the pre-existing governments . Still, within a few years, the Spaniards still took control of the cities .
 Patterns of tribute were maintained as well as the labor draft of the Inca mita . Now labor would be devoted to the silver mines and not just road, irrigation, and building projects .
 conquistadors were rewarded for military service with encomiendas . As they had been in Spain during the Reconquista, conquistador was rewarded for his service .
 From a root word meaning “entrusting,” encomiendas were grants of captured territory and the people that lived on it . The encomendero was theoretically responsible for bringing into the Christian community .
 This technique had been used in Spain to keep track of conquered Muslims and make sure they did not backslide after their forced conversions .
 American staple crops were successfully adopted by farmers in Europe . They provided better and more reliable nutrition which sparked a population boom . The population boom in Europe led to a boom in food production .
 Adam Smith’s classic, On the Wealth of Nations, was written about potatoes . New foods were so important in preventing cyclical famines that regularly hit Europe, they became a key topic in the classic .
 Many plant species developed by native Americans are still crucial to the world economy . They include maize, potatoes, and cassava, but also tomatoes, sweet potatoes and cacao .
 Quinine, a medicine made from the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree, was effective treating malaria and helped open the African and Asian tropics to European colonization . Quinine was used to treat malaria and help open European colonization of the tropics .
 Eurasian plants like sugar, soybeans, oranges, bananas and rice were also extensively cultivated in the Americas for profitable shipment back to European markets .
 Exports of native and transplanted crops helped feed growing cities and, by the mid-18th century, freed agricultural workers to enter new industries .
 Without inexpensive Native American foods, there might have been no Industrial Revolution . Without inexpensive and abundant Native American food, the Industrial Revolution might not have been possible .
 The first image of Potosi published in amount of gold was published in gold . Europeans never found El Dorado, the “golden man” that expanded in legends to a city of gold .
 The Bolivian city of Potosi, located in the Andes at an elevation of 18,420 feet, still has the largest population of any city at that altitude . For example, Potosi in Bolivia still has largest population at that height .
 Potosi was established by the Spanish in 1542 on the site of a long-standing native mining village at the foot of the Cerro Rico, which is a literal mountain of silver . Potosi is located near the town of Potosi in the province of Los Blancos .
 Potosi has a current population of about 165,000, almost identical to the city’s population in 1660, when the highaltitude mining center was larger than Seville, Madrid, or Rome . The combined population of ALL European colonies in North America was only about 75
 Every year between 1566 and 1815, a treasure fleet sailed from Acapulco to Manila laden with silver for the trade in China and India . Every year every year the fleet sailed to Manila loaded with silver .
 Another fleet carried spices and expensive Chinese ceramics acquired in Asia from Veracruz to Spain . Another fleet took precious metals, spices, and expensive ceramies from China .
 Products originating in the Americas were a spur to the Industrial Revolution . Once again, products originating from the Americas spurred the industrial revolution .
 Without the money minted from Latin America’s silver and gold, there might have been no global commercial boom to finance European industrialization . The money might have helped finance Europe's industrialization in the 1930s .
 Most of the easilyextractible silver was taken out of the mountain centuries ago . The story of Bolivian children is told in the award-winning documentary, The Devil's Miner .
 Most of the Spanish in the New World were male soldiers in the first decades of the conquest . Women were taken from native communities to be wives and mistresses .
 Inca native wrote to King of Spain complaining that Spaniards are taking all the Indian women of childbearing age . The place was being flooded with mestizos who were not required to work as the Indians were .
 The fathers were not supporting their illegitimate children, and “if a Spaniard steals away four Indian women to make little mestizos, he will bribe the judges and refuse to recognize his paternity,” says the Spanish state .
 Most of the countries of Latin America are built on mixed or mestizo populations . In the 1700s, the colonists tried to make distinctions between all the various types of people they believed made up their societies .
 Many of these mixed Euro-American populations have developed strong ethnic identities . Although these distinctions were somewhat arbitrary and were often used to uphold the power of the group at the top .
 There were only about twenty-five hundred French people in the province by 1663 . In 1663, only about 25,000 French people were there .
 Most of the voyageurs were voyageurs, fur traders who went into the northern forests to make fortunes . Most of these voyageurs made their fortunes in northern forests .

 They made up the landed elite, often descendants of the original encomenderos . They were the vast majority of the merchant class and some of the higher clergy . The landed elite were the most prominent merchants and clergy .
 Mestizos, people of mixed race, worked as artisans and in the lower clergy, or farmed their own small holdings or estates of criollo landowners . Beneath them were mestizo, people who worked in lower clergy or in the upper clergy .
 Indians were below mestizos, and although they often managed their own communities, tribute and labor obligations required them to work in the wage economy managed by the Spanish . Indians were often managed by their own community .
 New designations like mulatto and zambo were developed to describe children of black-white and black-Indian unions . Later, when the colonists started importing African slaves, new designations were developed .
 'mixed' populations often played the same role in the economy and society as mestizos . They were located closer to the sugar-growing regions to which enslaved Africans were brought .
 French Huguenots tried to establish a colony near present-day Rio de Janeiro in the mid-1500s . The Portuguese were initially more interested in dominating trade routes in the Indian Ocean, so they ignored their new possession .
 By that time, the Portuguese had watched the Spanish become successful cultivating sugar cane in the Caribbean . The Spanish became successful in the growing sugar industry .
 The Spanish and Portuguese had learned how to grow and process sugar in the Middle East during the Crusades . Sugar was already grown with enslaved African labor on profitable plantations in Portugal’s island colonies off the African coast .
 Portuguese entrepreneurs brought cane and slaves to Brazil and set up plantations along the northern coast . The plantation was set up along the north coast .
 By this time, the Catholic Church had prohibited the enslavement of Indians, but not of Africans . By the time of the 19th century, Africans were enslaved .
 Native Brazilians did not establish the complex societies found in Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America, so it was actually harder to ‘conquer’ them, as they escaped deeper into the interior jungles and forests .
 The Portuguese already had established colonies and trade ties in Africa, which supplied enslaved labor to the sugar plantations . However, the Portuguese had already established colonies .
 Slavery was a traditional element in all world societies, including those of Africa . Europeans quickly grasped the usefulness of having enslaved Africans in European communities because it would be harder for them to blend in with the local population .
 The sugar trade spurred the slave trade, as well as European notions of racial superiority to justify the enslavement of people . It was used as a tool to justify European ideas of superiority .

 Until the mid-1700s, China and India dominated world commerce and industry . Even though we are concentrating in this chapter on the intricacies of the Atlantic World, it is important to remember that .
 Chinese silks and Indian cotton were the world’s best quality and lowest-cost textiles . Clothes made from them were worn throughout the world -— even in Spain‘s colonies where the law required people to trade only with the home country .
 The national costume of Mexico is called the China Poblana . It was originally a contraband silk dress worn by women of the towns . The costume is now the national costume .
 The British were so intimidated by Asian textiles that they imposed tariffs to protect their own weavers from being driven out of the business .
 Mercantilism was not a primitive economic system that evolved into free market capitalism . It was an attempt to shield British and European merchants from an already-existing international free market in which they were often losers to the dominant Asian powers .

 Spain applied the same model of Iberian conquest and colonization to the Americas, granting conquered land with all of its inhabitants to the encomenderos . The encomenders were selected for their proven loyalty to King and empire, and to the Catholic Church .
 Soldiers and clergy were pledged to Crown and Church, as well as the administrators, artisans and artisans . Hernan Cortés, conqueror of the Aztecs, arrived in and premier encomendero of New Spain, was also pledged to the Crown .
 The British used their colonies in North America as havens for religious dissenters, as a safety-valve to reduce the numbers of the poor in England, and as dumping grounds for other troublemakers .
 Massachusetts was settled by Puritans who had rejected the Church of England . The state was settled in by Puritan settlers .
 Advocates of further reform soon left and settled Connecticut and Rhode Island, which were open to settlers of all religions . Catholics instead settled in Maryland .
 If the Spanish had followed the British policy of shipping their undesirables to the New World, "Latin" America might have become “Judeo-Islamic” America . Jews and Muslims who refused to convert to Catholicism were sent .
 The Spanish and British governed their colonies in very different ways . Spain and Britain governed colonies in different ways during colonial times .
 The BB Spanish Crown wanted to directly rule their American empire . The peninsulares were Spanish viceroys, judges, governors, y governors, and mayors .
 British colonists had already had already a sense of selfa government through their parliament, which checked the power of the King and controlled the treasury .
 British colonists set up legislatures, held town-hall meetings, appointed governors, and made many of their own laws rather than waiting for instructions from London .
 This difference in representative government, however, does not mean that Spanish colonists were completely deferential to the Spanish .
 They often applied the concept of “obedezco, pero no cumplo” to regulations made by the Council of Indies . They believed that they believed regulations did not consider local realities in the Americas .
 Similar protests in the Thirteen Colonies would not occur until the 1770s . Similar protests would not happen in the 17th century . The 17th-century protests would only occur in 17th Century .
 Land arrangements were also very different between the British and the Spanish . Land arrangements between the Spanish and the British were very different .
 The Spanish followed the tradition of the encomendero, in which a large landowner employed indigenous and mestizo workers, while the British settlers preferred the individual family farm .
 In the long run, this economic difference affected attitudes about entrepreneurship and ideas of personal liberty . The economic difference was seen in the long-term, according to the economist .
 The fourth major difference between Spanish and British America involves relationships with indigenous peoples . The relationship between the two nations is that of the indigenous people .
 The Spanish Empire included the indigenous in their colonial project, partly because of the blood ties that connected many of the Spanish with their mestizo descendants . Many of the Spaniards had blood ties with indigenous people .
 Mestizos and Indians were often protected or tolerated by Spanish authorities in their own settlements as long as they paid tribute and at least pretended to be Catholic .
 The Indians in Latin America also faced the problem of the Spanish allowing their pigs and cattle to destroy native plantings . Spanish colonial records reveal that the indigenous brought this injustice to local Spanish judges, who often determined in favor of the Indians .
 Many natives felt part of colonial society, and confidently challenged Spanish landowners in court . Many natives were part of the colonial society .
 "Protection" offered by Catholic clergy required abandoning their own religion and customs and practices . They did not have complete control over their lives and the “protection” offered by . Catholic clergy .
 The Spanish did not want to physically eliminate the indigenous, but they did advocate a cultural genocide of sorts, which was never complete due to native resistance . The Spanish were never able to complete the cultural genocide, which never did .
 Despite the Columbian Exchange there were more natives left in North America . But this was, in the long run, less successful than the destruction of native culture . Despite this, there were still natives left .
 Native languages thrive in many parts of Central and South America where they are preserved and spoken by millions . North America's tribal tongues of North America struggle to stay relevant .
 The social and economic differences between British and Spanish America clearly have consequences even today, some positive and others negative . The social differences between Britain and Spain have consequences today .

 MAXIMILIAN ROBESPIERRE, THE POLITICIAL PHILOSOPHY OF TERROR, FEBRUARY 5, 1794 . Citizen-representatives of the people. Citizens-representative of people. The political philosophy of terror .
 Some time ago we set forth the principles of our foreign policy; today we come to expound the principles, our internal policy . President Obama spoke at a White House event in Washington, D.C. on Monday .
 French people have finally demonstrated a character and a government, says French President Nicolas Sarkozy . After having proceeded haphazardly for a long time, the government has finally shown a character, he says .
 A sudden change in the nation’s fortune announced to Europe the regeneration that had been effected in the national representation . The country's fortunes have changed dramatically in the last few years .
 We have been guided, amid such stormy circumstances, by the love of good and by the awareness of our country’s needs rather than by an exact theory and by precise rules of conduct, which we did not have even leisure enough to lay out, he says .
 The reign of that eternal justice whose laws have been inscribed, not in marble and stone, but in the hearts of all men, even in that of the slave who forgets them . The peaceful enjoyment of liberty and equality is the reign of eternal justice, the author writes .
 We wish to substitute merit for intrigue, genius for wit, truth for glamour, the charm of happiness for sensuous boredom . The republic is to say all the virtues and the miracles of the republic in place of all the vices and all the absurdities of the monarchy .
 We want to fulfill natures’s desires, accomplish the destiny of humanity, keep the promises of philosophy, absolve providence from the long reign of crime and tyranny . We want, in a word, to fulfill the desires of natures, accomplish humanity .
 Let France, formerly illustrious among the enslaved lands, eclipses the glory of all the free peoples who have existed, become the model for the nations, the terror of oppressors . Let us, in sealing our work with our blood, see at least the early dawn of the universal bliss
 It is virtue which is nothing other than the love of the nation and its law, says French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Public virtue which worked so many wonders in Greece and Rome .
 There are important consequences to be drawn immediately from the principles we have just explained . There are also consequences to the principles of the principles, we have explained .
 Since the soul of the Republic is virtue, equality, and since your goal is to found, to consolidate the Republic, it follows that the first rule of your political conduct ought to be to relate all your efforts to maintaining equality and developing virtue .
 This everything that tends to excite love of country, to purify morals, to elevate souls, to . direct the passions of the human heart toward the public interest, ought to be adopted or established by you . This should be adopted by you, the President .
 Everything which tends to awaken enjoyment for petty things and scorn for great ones, ought to be rejected or curbed by you . Everything that tends to concentrate them in the abjection of selfishness, should be rejected .
 Within the scheme of the French revolution, that which is immoral is impolitic . That which is corrupting is counterrevolutionary, according to the French revolutionary .
 The characteristic of popular government is to be trustful towards the people and severe towards itself. We deduce from all this a great truth that we deduce that a great .
 The development of our theory would reach its limit, if you had only had only to steer the ship of the Republic through calm waters. Here the development of the theory would be reached its limit .
 "But the tempest rages, and the state of the revolution in which you find yourselves imposes upon you another task," he wrote .
 "We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with them," says President Obama . "We need to smother our enemies," says Obama .
 The first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Now, in this situation, the first maxim is to lead by reason, not by terror .
 It is less a special principle than a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country’s most pressing needs . It is a result of the principle that is applied to the country's most pressing need, says David Cameron .
 It has been said that terror was the mainspring of despotic government . Terror is said to have been the main ingredient of despotism .
 The sword which glitters in the hands of liberty's heroes resembles the one with which tyranny’s lackeys are armed . Yes, as the sword that glitters is the one which tyranny's lackeys use, it is the same as tyranny's .
 Let the despot govern his brutalized subjects by terror; he is right to do this, as a despot . Let's not be afraid, let's be afraid. Let's be scared. Let't be afraid .
 Subdue liberty's enemies by terror, and you will be right, as founders of the Republic, says George W. Bush . Subdue Liberty's enemies with terror, he says, and they will be the right to do so .
 "The government of the revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny," says the British revolutionary . The revolution was founded in France in 1903, the French Revolution .
 To punish the oppressors of humanity is clemency; to pardon them is barbarity . To punish an oppressor's oppressors is clelemency . To pardon them would be barbarity. To punish them, pardon them, is not to punish them. To be clem
 The rigor of tyrants has only rigor for a principle, the republican government comes from charity, says George W. Bush . "The rigor" of the Republican government is charity, he says .
 How frivolous it would be to regard a few victories achieved by patriotism as the end of all our dangers. patriotism is not the answer to all the dangers of patriotism, it says .
 You will become aware that vigilance and energy are more necessary for you than ever . You will be aware of that vigilance .
 An unresponding ill-will everywhere opposes the operations of the government . An unresponsive ill will everywhere opposes government's operations .
 The inevitable influence of foreign courts is no less active for being more hidden, and no less baneful, says the author of the book . Foreign courts are no less likely to be more hidden and baneful .
 You could never have imagined some of the excesses committed by hypocritical counter-revolutionaries in order to blight the cause of the revolution, says the author of the book .
 The rumor was spread particularly through the former province of Brittany and in the departments of the Rhine and the Moselle . This rumor was . spread particularly . through the . former province, Brittany .
 The former public prosecutor of the criminal court of Strasbourg is accused of a series of crimes . He was accused of the crimes against him in the 1980s and 1990s .
 That man’s tyrannical follies make everything that has been said of Caligula and Heliogabalus credible; one can scarcely believe it, despite the evidence . That man's tyrannical folly makes everything he has said, including the evidence.
 He pushed his delirium to the point of commandeering women for his own use we are told that he even employed that method in selecting a wife . We are told he used that method to select his own wife .
 At the same time you have the tyrants of Europe to combat, a million and two hundred thousand men under arms to maintain, and that the government is obliged continually to repair, with energy and vigilance, all the injuries which the innumerable multitude of our enemies has prepared for us during the
 "We know no other than the development of that general motive force of the Republic virtue," says President Obama . "The Republic virtue is a force of virtue," he says .
 The double task of the moderates and the false revolutionaries is to toss us back and forth perpetually between these two perils, writes David Gergen . Gergen: "The double task" of moderates and revolutionaries is tossing us between them and revolutionaries .
 Government is always the master at being just and wise; and, when it has that character, it is sure of the confidence of the people .

 The British, who had led the defense against his final invasion, chose St. Louis instead of St. Charles .
 St. Helena in the South Atlantic as a permanent home for the exiled Emperor . The Emperor was exiled to the island island of Helena . The island was built in the 1930s as a base for the Emperor .
 Napoleon was transported to the island, which was administered by the East India Company, in 1815 and lived there for the rest of his life . Napoleon lived on the island until 1815 .
 At the Congress of Vienna, the old ruling families of Europe got together to try to restore what they thought of as peace and order . The Congress ran from November 1814 through June 1815, and ended in 1815 .
 The brother of the executed King, Louis XVI, took the French throne as Louis XVIII . The restored king agreed to return the territories Napoleon had conquered to the nations that had held them previously .
 ‘Chartists’ in Great Britain demanded an extension of suffrage to all men over 21, along with other political reforms . Chartists in Britain demanded the extension of the suffrage in 1838 .
 The Chartists also launched the occasional cat at the club-wielding bobbies, apparently .
 Liberals tried to distance themselves from the social leveling and economic redistribution the Jacobins had attempted . Liberals identified instead with ideas like free trade and a limited franchise . Liberals were born in France .
 Radicals pushed for greater equality and more rights for regular people . But radicals pushed for more rights to ordinary people .
 British workers agitated for the right to vote and for a social contract called the People’s Charter in the 1830s and 40s, but conservative Tories blocked the Chartists . Conservatives blocked the chartists' attempts to change the law in the 1930s and 1940s .
 Enlightenment-inspired ideas about democracy, popular sovereignty, and new ideas like socialism all came to a head in Europe by 1848 . 1848 was known as the Year of Revolutions .
 Potatoes had proved to be an ideal crop for Ireland, and it produced enough of the crop for itself and most of the rest of the British Isles . Losing this important food source was disastrous for the Irish peasants .
 British government aid proved incompetent and ineffective, revealing a scandalous level of prejudice against the Catholic Irish, the first colonized people of the British Crown . An image of the Irish Famine published in Ra ; 1849 in the Illustrated London News .
 Food shortages spread to Scotland and central Europe, where the Czech potato harvest was reduced by half because of the blight . Food shortages also spread to central Europe and Scotland .
 In addition to rural famines, a lot of Britain and parts of Europe had begun to industrialize, and poor urban workers were dissatisfied with their wages and living conditions .
 In 1848, rebels temporarily took control of Vienna and forced the Austro-Hungarian Empire to end serfdom . The revolution was in response to a revolt by rebels who took over Vienna .
 Southern Italians revolted against the French still occupying their homeland . Southern Italians were still fighting for their homeland in Italy .
 A revolution in France ended the monarchy once again and created the Second French Republic . The Second French Revolution was created after a revolution in 1903 .
 The U.S. became a “safety valve” for the underemployed, politically marginalized, and persecuted of Europe . But beginning in the 1830s and 1840s, immigration from Europe exploded, and the United States became a "safety valve"
 The Irish in the 1840s were followed by Germans after 1848, who remain the largest single immigrant group . The Irish were the largest immigrant group in Europe .
 Scandinavians began arriving after the Civil War . Most new immigrants came from southern Europe and from eastern Europe . Large numbers of persecuted Jews from the Russian Empire .
 By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Americans were of German ethnicity . The majority of U.S. was of German .
 22 million people are probably mostly of English or Scotch-Irish descent, based on the history of the region . The region's population is estimated to be around 22 million .
 Statewide, the German pluralities range from 11% in Florida to 48% in North Dakota . North Dakota's capital is named after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck .
 Social changes in Europe and America are a direct result of the Industrial Revolution . Many of the changes in the less developed world we will discuss in a later chapter .
 Before we look at the rest of the world, let’s look more closely at industrialization. So before we looked at the other world, we should look at industrialized industrialization .
 The last two hundred years of human history is also the story of the Industrial Revolution and its affects . The Industrial Revolution was the birth of the modern industrial revolution .
 Hand-held electronic devices were not all that common even ten years ago . Consider how many of you may be reading this on a hand-held device, which were not common in the past .
 By the late 1700s, Great Britain had all of these and became the birthplace of the industrial revolution . The industrial revolution was the birth of the modern industrial revolution in Britain .
 Capital—wealth that is invested to create more wealth—was_ available to merchants and others who benefitted from world trade .
 The East India Company was also a source of capital through their trade with South Asia in tea and textiles . Furthermore, the company was also an important source of investment .
 The Company also was the model for a successful joint-stock company . Individual investors purchased shares, which spread ownership and limited financial liability, allowing for greater risk taking .
 Soon, factories would be following the same joint-stock model in order to accumulate the necessary capital for investment . The model would be similar to that of the Chinese factories .
 New technology also made mass production possible, which first occurred in the British textile industry . Mass production was first made possible in the 1930s .
 The spinning jenny and power looms increased the efficiency of spinning wool and cotton, and then weaving the thread and yarn into cloth . Power looms allowed the spinning of cotton and wool to be more efficient .
 Inventors began seeing the possibilities of mechanical production in other areas such as processed foods, clothing, paper, and household items . From this beginning, inventors began to see the possibilities for mechanical production .
 Countries usually begin on the path to industrialization through the textile and processed food industries . Even today, countries usually begin their industrialization by industrializing through textile .
 Textile mills initially used the power of rivers to spin water wheels and turbines connected to spinning and weaving machines . Like flour mills, textile mills used the same power as flour mills .
 Later, the development of an efficient coal-fired steam engine by Scottish the engineer James Watt made it possible to locate factories closer to cities, transportation hubs, workers, and consumers .
 Both water and coal are still important sources of energy throughout the world . Water is still important source of energy in many countries .
 Agricultural improvements in the previous century and the introduction of new staple crops like the potato, imported from the Americas, produced more food using less labor . The potato was introduced in the 19th century, and the potato was imported from America .
 Improved nutrition allowed Britain’s population to grow, increasing the number of people available for work in the factories .
 Great Britain also created consumers for textiles, foods, and other products manufactured in new factories . With a larger population involved in a wage economy, producing goods for others and not for themselves, Great Britain .
 British merchants were selling industrial products to Continental Europe and to an increasingly important market of consumers in Britain’s colonies . Soon, British merchants began selling industrial goods to Continental . Europe .
 The ability to sell manufactured goods to a “captive’ market added to the rush for overseas empires by the European powers, the United States, and Japan in the 19th and early 20th centuries .
 Every nation wanted consumers for the products of the ‘home country’ and wanted to lock up the valuable natural resources needed by the industries of the empire . ‘Every nation’s economic interests were important to the empire’
 In early America, for clothing, a regular part of women’s work was spinning thread and yarn from wool, flax, or cotton at home, then weaving cloth and making ‘homespun” clothing for their families .
 As soon as they were able to buy cloth from textile mills, women took advantage of the opportunity to devote more of their time to other tasks around the farm .
 Pins were an example of a manufactured product farm families needed that could not be made on the farm . Pins are a popular product that can't be made by farm families .
 Pins and other such necessities were usually supplied by peddlers who walked across the countryside in the days before easy access to stores, and then later by . general storekeepers .
 Huguenot weavers are descendants of refugees from France . The weavers worked in East London in the 1930s .
 This was a whole community of people who specialized in weaving using tools and uddites breaking a jacquard loom . techniques that were available before the advent of large-scale textile mills . techniques .
 Governments were quick to crack down on Luddites — a couple of executions quickly took the wind out of their sails . The executions were quickly taken out of the sails .
 Industrialization was possible because farms were producing high yields in the early 19th century . Farm workers created an available workforce and a consumer market for many of the products of early industry .
 Nations like Britain with colonies had another lucrative market for manufactures . Britain's colonies were also lucrative markets for manufacturers .
 Britain cultivated trade relationships with other new nations like Latin America . Britain also cultivated trade relations with other nations like those of Latin America.
 British representatives worked hard to convince these new nations not to go to the expense of trying to develop their own industries but instead to ship raw materials to Britain in exchange for cheap consumer goods from British factories .
 Official British trade missions argued the benefits of ‘free trade’ now that Britain’s manufacturers had gained the advantage in producing low-cost goods .
 Adam Smith championed free markets championed by Adam Smith and his disciples . But the devotion to free markets was new-found . Adam Smith's followers of free markets were new-to-found.
 Cotton calicoes from India in the 1720s had begun to be preferred for making English clothing . The domestic wool industry had pressured Parliament into passing the Calico Acts to prohibit their import .
 The government did not consider the complaints of the East London weavers . It took steps to protect trade secrets and prevent too rapid a technology transfer to help British industry profit .
 Britain began producing cotton cloth even more inexpensively than India . Suddenly the British began preaching about “free trade” and pushing to erase any tariffs .
 Continental Europe and the U.S. tired of simply being a source of raw materials for British factories and a market for British goods . The governments of Continental Europe . and the United States quickly tired .
 To support economic development, these governments began taxing imports with tariffs to protect emerging industries from a flood of British manufactured goods .
 Tariffs increased the price of imports to consumers, encouraging them to buy domestically-produced goods . Tariffs increase the cost of imports, encouraging consumers to buy the nowcompetitive domestically-made goods .
 Protection from foreign competition has helped many fledgling industries get off the ground in developing nations . Protests have been successful in some of the world's most developed countries .
 Governments that choose to constantly raise tariffs run the risk of subsidizing their industries’ inefficiencies and reducing the welfare of their consumers as industrial improvements in other countries lower the price of imported products .
 This description misses a whole generation of innovation and growth when textile mills were powered by water . Textile mills are powered by electricity and water .
 The Scottish textile factories of New Lanark were begun in 1786 by David Dale using water-power technology developed by Richard Arkwright in the 1770s . The factories began using water power technology developed in the 1800s .
 New Lanark was built on the Clyde River in Scotland, and all of its machines were powered by the river until the mills closed in 1968 .
 The American textile mills in New England that dominated the world market in the second half of the 19th century also used water power .
 Boston Manufacturing Company built the cities of Lowell and Lawrence in Massachusetts to take advantage of the water power of the Merrimack River . The men who started the companies visited New Lanark in 1811 to learn the technology .
 Owen built schools for the children of his workers and social organizations for the families . Owen was concerned about the negative social changes that industrial growth had brought to other parts of Britain . Owen built a school for children of workers and organizations for families .
 He put an end to the long-standing custom of forcing workers to buy only from the company store . He tried to make New Lanark a real, living town .
 Owen’s partners objected to his philanthropy, claiming that healthy, happy, well-educated workers did not really boost the bottom line . Owen's partners had objected to the philanthropy . He said healthy and happy workers do not boost the company's bottom line.
 The initial expansion of transportation networks for massproduction industries was also water-based . Water-based transportation networks were also expanded for mass production industries .
 canal-building became a craze from the 1820s through the 1840s . Canal-building was a popular craze in industrializing countries . Canal-building is now a popular tourist attraction in Europe .
 Many local canals connected newlyestablished towns and villages to markets all over the United States, Great Britain, and continental Europe . Canals were used to connect newly established towns to markets across the U.S.
 Erie Canal was key to the western settlement and expansion of the United States . Agricultural goods shipped down the Canal eventually made their way to markets in industrializing East Coast cities .
 Canal laborers were frequently Irish immigrants, who often settled nearby, once the canal was built . Canal laborers are frequently Irish .
 Steam power soon became extremely important in transportation, as well as the transportation industry . Steam power was used to power many of the world's largest ships .
 Until steam engines put on riverboats, shipping depended on either wind and river currents or on human and animal power on canal towpaths . The first steam engines were used in the early 1800s .
 Goods could easily be floated south from farms on America’s rivers for example, but it was much more difficult and expensive to ship products against currents to the frontier .
 Flatboats and rafts accumulated at downstream ports such as New Orleans . They were often broken down and burned as firewood . Flatboats were often burned to be used as fire wood .
 Ocean-going steamships made travel and shipping quicker and safer . They allowed travelers and merchants to keep to regular schedules . They were used to carry passengers and cargo .
 The first steam patent was granted to a Spanish inventor named Jeronimo Beaumont in 1606, whose engine drove a pump used to drain mines . The engine was used to pump a drain in mines .
 Englishman James Watt’s 1781 engine was the first to produce rotary power that could be adapted to drive mills, wheels, and propellers . The engine was first to be adapted into a machine that could drive mills and wheels .
 Robert Fulton caught steam fever after visiting Paris and developing canal-dredging machine . Fulton had previously patented a canal dredging device .
 Fulton launched the first commercial American steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807 . Fulton sailed an experimental steamboat model on the Seine, and then returned home . Fulton returned home to launch the first steamboat in the United States . Fulton's first commercial steamboat was launched in 18
 Fulton built the New Orleans in 1811 in Pittsburgh and began regular steamboat service on the Mississippi . Fulton built a steamboat from 1811 to 1811 .
 The other transportation technology enabled by steam power was the railroad, which was even more revolutionary than the steamboat . The railroad was the first railroad powered by steam powered technology .
 In spite of their power and speed, steampowered riverboats depended on rivers or occasionally on canals to run, but a railroad could be built almost anywhere .
 The expansion of commerce was no longer limited by the routes nature had provided into the frontier . Suddenly, commerce no longer had to be limited by nature's routes .
 The first railroads in the U.S. had actually been built on the East Coast before a steam engine was available to power them . The first trainroads were built in the first place of its kind .
 Trains of cars pulled by horses looked a lot like stage-coaches on rails . Trains were pulled by horsemen .
 Englishman George Stephenson’s locomotives began pulling passengers and freight in northwestern England in the mid-1820s . Americans quickly switched to steam in the wake of Stephenson's success in the U.S.
 The Tom Thumb was the first locomotive used to pull cars in the United States . It was built in 1880 for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . It is the first of its kind .
 Tom Thumb lost its maiden race against a horse-drawn train . Baltimore and Ohio owners were convinced by the demonstration of steam technology and committed to developing steam .
 The B&O railroad was established in 1827 to compete with the Erie Canal . It was established to move people and freight from the interior to the coast . The Erie Canal was already a faster way to move freight and passengers .
 Factories housed machinery that was too large or too expensive to be used in home production .
 The new industries were usually producing products for much larger (sometimes even global) markets . And often, although it took fewer people to weave a given amount of cloth using the new technology .
 So much cloth was made in the new industrial textile centers like New Lanark in Scotland or Lowell in America that there were often a lot of new jobs — sometimes more than previously available in that region .
 The new factory jobs required less skill than artisanal craftwork, especially when the worker was making a larger number of standardized products . New factory jobs require less skill, especially in manufacturing .
 A lathe operator could turn large quantities of legs that could be assembled into any number of chairs of a standard pattern . Previously, a carpenter needed to be a skilled craftsman to design and assemble a custom-built chair .
 Workers doing lower-skilled jobs became as standardized as the things they made, and could be employed at a much lower cost . Workers doing such jobs could be standardized as well as the products they made .
 More people might be working in a new factory compared to an old-fashioned craft workshop . Each worker's wages would almost always be lower .
 It was no longer a slow organic process where an apprentice became a master craftsman, developed a clientele, opened his own business, then hired a few workers or apprentices of his own . It was a slow process where apprentice became master craftsmen, developed clientele and opened a business
 The people who started factories were often not even experts at the process they were going to do . They were capitalists and investors who had access to the large sums of money needed to erect a factory and fill it .
 A class of owners grew, who had little or no connection to the workers they employed, grew . A class grew, with little or little connection to workers, workers .
 The cotton gin’s first use 70 years earlier . Smarvann . The first use of the cotton gin was in 18th century .
 American inventor Eli Whitney is remembered for the cotton gin . The cotton gin removed seeds from cotton fiber much more quickly than they could be picked out by hand .
 Cotton gin helped propel the American South into world leadership in raw cotton . The cotton gin was used to make millions of dollars in cotton .
 By the 1850s, American plantations supplied 80 to 90% of the world cotton market . The cotton market was dominated by plantations in America .
 Whitney’s most important contribution to industrialization was his technique for using machine tools to produce interchangeable parts for firearms . Whitney's technique was used to make interchangeable parts of firearms .
 Whitney’s standardized, machined parts, it no longer took a skilled gunsmith to build a weapon . Whitney's standardized parts are machined and machined . Whitney: "With this technology, it's easy to make a weapon with no need to be built"
 Anybody with basic skills could assemble and also disassemble, repair, and maintain a rifle or handgun .
 Weapons became more reliable and the technique was quickly applied to other industries . The technique was used to make weapons more reliable . It was also used in other industries, such as weapons manufacturing .
 Most of the intelligence in the job had been moved into the machine, the machine gradually became more valuable and the machine operator less . Of course, since most of the . intelligence . in the . job had to be moved into . the machine .
 Whitney’s process made guns more reliable and less expensive . He turned not only the gun parts into interchangeable parts, but also the factory employees themselves . Whitney's process made gun parts more reliable, less expensive, and more reliable .
 Industrialization produced quality products at low prices for a growing consumer market . But industrialization disrupted the lives of workers . Addressing the Negative Effects of Industrialization .
 People moved from rural areas to growing metropolitan areas . Since jobs were in factory towns and cities, people moved to growing cities . People moved to urban areas to find jobs .
 People were cut off from communities in which they had lived for generations, and forced to find new social relations . Additionally, people were forced to leave their communities, or fall into lonely and desperate lives .
 Although jobs were the attraction for the new migrants, there was no guarantee of permanent positions in the new economy . Although jobs are the attraction, there were no guarantees of permanent jobs .
 Traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity could be challenged when the male breadwinner was replaced by a spouse or daughter as the main source of family income, leading to violence, alcoholism and abandonment of the family by men . Families were disrupted by unemployment, unemployment and unemployment, while traditional ideas of
 Inadequate housing, sanitation, and transportation contributed to environment degradation and psychological stress . The U.S. has been hit by a wave of low-quality housing and sanitation problems .
 Many intellectuals took up the challenge of rethinking how to make society more just for industrial workers . Many intellectuals have taken to the challenge to re-think how to improve society for workers .
 A new understanding of capital and labor seemed to be needed in the wake of the U.S. War of Independence and the French Revolution .
 Workers in new industries provided all of the labor at low wages and in dangerous conditions . Owners and investors reaped the profits, often absentee owners and investors . Workers in the new industries provide all the labor .
 Industrialists such as Robert Owen tried to make their factories more humane, embracing the cooperative movement and even improving workers’ welfare with schools for their children .
 Many business owners did not see their responsibility to workers extending beyond providing a wage for the work they performed . However, many business owners saw their responsibility extended beyond providing workers with a wage .
 Karl Marx, a German philosopher, criticized the growth of capitalism and industrialization . Karl Marx brought a new analysis to economic thinking. Karl Marx was born in Russia and died in 1903 .
 Marx called the more numerous workers, whom he called the proletariat and the industrial capitalists, the bourgeoisie . According to Marx, this last battle was between the workers and industrial capitalists . Marx said the proletariat was the most numerous, the proletariat .
 Marx believed the proletariat would inevitably defeat the bourgeoisie, seize the factories, and create a socialist utopia . Marx believed that the world would be a utopia if the proletariat defeated the bourgeoisie .
 Marx predicted a world where the workers or their government controlled the ‘means of production’, the factories and farms . Marx predicted that a world of workers and their government would control the means of production . After the final battle, Marx predicted the workers would control their factories and
 Marx said workers would develop a ‘class consciousness’ that would help extend the worldwide proletarian revolution . Marx said religion was ‘the opiate of the people’ instead of religion . Instead of religion, Marx said that would be ‘an opiate’ of the
 Marx imagined a global working class that transcended nations, races, and ethnic groups . His vision was for an international dictatorship of the proletariat, where all workers would unite regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or religion .
 Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, published their ideas in the Communist Manifesto in February, 1848, just as Europe entered a year of attempted revolutions . Marx and Engels published the idea in the Manifesto .
 Marx continued to publish his theories and predictions, and organized the first Marxist socialist parties . Since the upheavals did not bring the promised dictatorship of the proletariat, Marx continued publishing his theories . Marx's predictions were not realized, but he continued publishing them .
 Marx's ideas inspired labor organizers to form unions in which workers could negotiate for better wages and working conditions with owners, under threat of striking . Even so, by the time of Marx’s death, his ideas and other forms of socialism were motivating labor .
 Socialism and communism, and their influence in governments and labor relations, will be examined more fully in later chapters . Communism and socialism will be discussed in the next chapter .
 As mentioned previously, industrialization depends on a stable foundation of agriculture to provide enough food for workers to increase the population . Fertilizer is a key ingredient in industrialization .
 As farming becomes more efficient, not everyone needs to focus on subsistence . Workers are available to move to cities and take jobs in factories . Farming is more efficient and workers are now available to work in cities .
 The remaining farms become bigger and take on the responsibility of feeding the growing urban populations . Farmers will continue to grow to feed the growing population .
 Earlier agricultural societies in Europe had depended on crop rotation to rebuild soils after periods of intensive planting .
 Farmers unwilling to accept the idea that a significant portion of their farms would be fallow each year . Some farmers saw an opportunity to earn money in the market, feeding urban industrial workers .
 They preferred to amend their soils rather than waiting for fertility to regenerate naturally . They prefer to amend soil rather than wait for fertility regeneration naturally .
 First commercial fertilizers were made from guano, the droppings of seabirds living on islands off the western shores of South America . The first commercial fertilizer was made of guano .
 Guano comes from the Quechua Indian word Wanu, which means any excrement used as a soil additive . Guano is an ingredient used as soil additive in the soil .
 Natives of the Andes have mined guano on the coast and islands for at least 1,500 years . Spanish colonial records noted that Inca rulers had considered protecting the cormorants that were the main source of guano so important, that disturbing the birds’ nesting
 Guano was carried from the coast up into the Andes on the backs of llamas, for use on the terraced farms surrounding highland cities like Machu Picchu .
 The islands off the western coast of South America are arid and arid . Although surrounded by ocean, the islands are off the west coast of the country .
 Some areas have no annual rainfall at all . Some areas are dryer than the rest of the mainland .
 Seabirds such as cormorants and pelicans have lived on these islands by the millions, for thousands of years . Seabird birds have lived in the islands by millions of years, and have lived there for thousands more .
 Due to the lack of rain, the droppings have simply piled up . Over that time, they’ve left literal mountains of droppings, which have piled up in the past month .
 The Workers mining guano on a Peruvian guano contains the . ideal percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to make it an excellent fertilizer without any mixing .
 It simply needs to be chopped off the mountain, ground up, and spread on fields . It simply need to be cut off and ground up in fields .
 Europeans and Americans fell on the area in a guano rush, and by the middle of the century several nations had enlisted the work of Chinese peasants . The Pacific labor system has been compared with the slavery of the Atlantic world .
 Many debtors were tricked into labor contracts promising work in California . Many were debtors who had been tricked into signing labor contracts . The Chinese workers were technically free .
 Once they reached the guano islands and realized they had been duped, there was no way off . Once they . reached the Guano islands, there were no way of escape, says author .
 Over a hundred thousand Chinese workers were imported to the islands in the second half of the nineteenth century . The islands were home to hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers .
 Guano was so profitable that the U.S. Congress passed a Guano Islands Act in 1856 . The act was passed by the United States Congress in 1858 .
 The law provided an incentive for American sailors to find and claim undefended islands for America . The law gave the discoverer exclusive rights to the guano recovered .
 Islands claimed under the Guano Islands Act include parts of the Hawaiian chain, Midway Atoll, part of American Samoa, and several islands still disputed with Colombia .
 The guano islands off the western coast of South America were so valuable that two wars were fought over them . Two wars fought over the islands .
 Chile and Peru fought Spain in the Chincha Islands War, 1864-66, and defeated the Spanish Empire . Peru and Chile won the war in 1864 to defeat Spain .
 Chile took many of the guano islands from Peru, along with the nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert, in the War of the Pacific, 1879-838 . Then, once Spain’s claim had been successfully set aside, Chile took control of many of
 After about 1870, guano was overtaken as a source of nitrogen by nitrate-rich desert soils called Caliche .
 These soils were discovered in the Atacama desert, a region regarded as the driest place on earth . They lay partly in Chile, partly in Peru, and partly in Bolivia .
 Chile challenged its northern rivals for the nitrate fields . All three nations rushed to extract and process the Caliche . Chile challenged northern rivals .
 Chile’s victory in the War of the Pacific extended its border northwards to encompass the Atacama desert, including all the coastal territory that had belonged to Bolivia . Chile's victory extended its borders to encompass all of its territory .
 Many ethnic Bolivians living around the port city of Arica still dream of throwing off the Chilean yoke . Bolivian people still dream about winning access to the Pacific again .
 The nitrate Chile monopolized was valuable both as a fertilizer and as a key ingredient in explosives and munitions . Chile's nitrate was valuable in the 1930s and '60s .
 Mining and processing nitrate from Chile’s desert soil required much more capital than digging guano . The process of nitrate mining and processing of the nitrate in the desert required more capital .
 Chile attracted British investors, and joint ventures began shipping a million tons of nitrate per year out of the South American desert .
 World War I created new incentives for Britain’s enemies to find an alternative to Caliche nitrate . Production grew steadily until 1914, when the war started in 1914 .
 We will discuss this shift to an economic form of imperialism, by European nations, Britain, and even the U.S. in the next chapter .
 China once again enjoyed a high degree of social stability, economic prosperity, and international trade . The new Qing emperors reinvigorated the Confucian ruling class .
 By the mid-1700s, the British East India Company dominated trade and the administration of India .
 British ships carried Indian cloth and other products to the rest of the world . The tea dumped in Boston Harbor in 1778 came from India .
 The East India Company was very interested in opening up Chinese markets to trade . But China was self-sufficient and uninterested in anything the British had to offer .
 Chinese teas, jade, silks and porcelain were in high demand in the West . The only payment China would accept was silver .
 For centuries the silver of the New World had been making its way into the Chinese economy . It became the money supply of the world’s largest economy .
 The East India Company’s supply of silver was limited . The company was forced to rely heavily on opium to pay for their silver .
 Qing had outlawed opium imports in 1729, but the East India Company controlled virtually unlimited supply . The Qing had banned opium imports from China, but it was controlled by the Company .
 At the beginning of the 19th century an annual average of 4,500 trunks of opium were reaching smugglers on the South China coast . At the start of the century, an average of . 4,000 opium trunks were . reaching smugglers .
 China rapidly shifted from being a magnet for silver with a huge trade surplus to a net importer . China's treasuries were rapidly dwindling .
 Some Chinese officials wanted to legalize opium so the empire could tax it, but Confucian moralists won the policy debate . Some officials wanted it legalized to help the empire tax it .
 Lin Zexu was sent to Canton in 1839 to stamp out the opium trade . Lin was one of China’s most distinguished officials .
 Lin blockaded the European trading district, raided and searched the foreigners’ warehouses, confiscated 20,000 chests containing 1200 tons of opium . Commissioner Lin Zexu, dubbed “Lin of dumped it all into the ocean’s ocean of opium, dumped it .
 The East India Company complained about its losses in London, and Queen Victoria sent a fleet including four steampowered battleships . Queen Victoria included four battleships in the fleet .
 Lightly-armored Chinese war junks, designed to fight river pirates, were severely outgunned . Lightly armed Chinese war ships were severely outnumbered by pirates .
 Qing cannon allowed the invaders to pummel Chinese defenses from a safe distance . The limited range of Qing cannon compared to British artillery allowed the invasion .
 The Treaty of Nanking opened five Chinese ports to European traders, gave the British the island of Hong Kong, and required China to establish diplomatic relations with Great Britain as an equal power . The treaty was called the "Unequal Treaty" by the Chinese .
 China’s embarrassing defeat by the British was followed by another defeat in the Second Opium War that resulted in another unequal treaty . The treaty gave access to French and Russian merchants .
 90 ports of call were available to more than 300,000 European and American traders, diplomats, and missionaries . By the 1890s, 90 ports were available for more than 30,000 people .
 British warships were able to easily destroy Chinese junks built for coastal defense . Armored, steam-powered British warships could easily destroy the junks .
 The weakness of the Qing empire against foreign aggression was exacerbated by the ongoing opium crisis and by crumbling infrastructure and famine in the countryside . The Qing empire was weakened by the opium crisis .
 A series of peasant revolts swept through south China in the 1850s and 1860s, most notably the Taiping Rebellion which killed 30 million people over a fifteen-year period .
 Hong Xiuquan, a young man who had become unhinged after failing the grueling civil service exam four times, led the rebellion . The leader of the rebellion was Hong Xuiquan who had failed the civil service exams four times .
 Hong had a vision and declared he was the little brother of Christ who had been sent to China to rid the land of the Manchu foreigners and their Confucianist culture . Hong declared he had been left behind by the Chinese to rid them of the land .
 When Hong captured Nanjing and made it the capital of the Taiping, he first killed all the Manchu men and then marched the women out of the city and burned them to death .
 Hong’s brutality and his strange interpretation of Christianity may have alienated some Europeans, but his ban on opium use antagonized more . Hong's brutal treatment of opium was the subject of much of the world's most famous novel .
 Europe and Britain threw their support behind the Qing dynasty they had just defeated in the Opium Wars . The Qing dynasty was defeated by the British Empire in China .
 Hong and his allies were unable to avoid the temptation to quarrel and plot against each other, which weakened their leadership . Hong's allies failed to avoid being able to resist the temptation of quarreling and plotting .
 Two Taiping attempts to take Shanghai in 1860 and 1862 were repelled with British and French assistance . Two attempts were made by Taiping in 1860s and 1862s .
 In 1864, the Qing and their European allies retook Nanjing and ended the regime . The resistance continued until 1871, when the last Taiping army was wiped out by government forces .
 The Japanese home islands have been united under the same imperial dynasty since the 5th century CE . The current emperor comes from the longest line of any monarch in the world .
 As an independent island nation, the Japanese were able to selectively accept or reject ideas and innovations from China, the powerful empire to the west . The Japanese chose not to accept ideas from China's powerful empire .
 Native Japanese Shinto religion, for instance, embraces the teachings of Buddha . Often they would modify and incorporate aspects of Chinese culture, like writing and Buddhism .
 Beginning in the late 1100s, the emperor ruled indirectly, ceding power to Shoguns, who commanded an army of lesser nobles known as samurai . The emperor ceded power to the Shogun, who command a samurai army, in the 1100s .
 The Shoguns held back invasions by Mongol armies in the 1200s and maintained a large degree of separation for the empire from outside religions and cultures .
 Self-isolation ended in the mid-19th century, when the U.S. decided to try and open trade with Japan . China was largely shut out of Europeandominated China .
 American Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay in July 1853 with a squadron of four warships . Perry threatened to open fire on the capital if the Japanese refused to negotiate . Perry was the first American to sail into Tokyo in 1853 .
 A “Treaty of Amity and Commerce” was offered to the Japanese by American diplomats as a less-invasive alternative to the aggressive colonialism of Britain and France in China following the Opium War . Three years later, a “treaty was signed,
 Modernization and the embrace of new technology went hand in hand with reorganization of the national government in what became known as the Meiji Restoration . Modernization was the result of reorganization and modernization of Japan's government .
 The 15th Tokugawa shogun resigned in November 1867 . Direct control of government was restored to the Emperor Meiji .
 The samurai class (which numbered nearly 2 million) was slowly disbanded and a nationwide universal military draft was instituted in 1873 . Nearly 2 million of the samurai class were slowly disbanded .
 The industrialization of Japan accelerated, building the strong nation we will see taking its place on the world stage in the next chapter . The industrialized nation will take its place in the world's next chapter, says President Obama .
 Satirical drawing in the magazine Punch shows the victory of “small” Japan over “large” China .
 In China, other rebellions such as the Nian Rebellion and Panthay Rebellion continued to challenge the Qing regime .
 In 1895, China lost control of its tribute state Korea to Japan in the first Sino-Japanese War . China lost its control of the tribute state in 1895, when it was defeated by Japan .
 The humiliating defeat for the Qing empire showed their efforts to modernize China’s military had failed . The defeat was a catalyst for a series of political actions led by revolutionaries like Sun Yat-sen .
 "Delighted did we feel that the kings of your honorable nation so clearly understood the great principles of propriety, and were so deeply grateful for the heavenly goodness (of our emperor)"
 Some foreign merchants have seduced our Chinese people by introducing opium by stealth . They have caused every province of the land to overflow with that poison . The Chinese people have been seduced by opium by means of stealth .
 Every native of the Inner Land who sells opium, as also all who smoke it, are alike adjudged to death . All who smoke opium are alike judged to death in China .
 Your honorable nation takes away the products of our central land, and not only do you thereby obtain food and support for yourselves, but also re-sell these products to other countries . You reap a threefold profit, says President Obama .
 We cannot bear to slay or exterminate without previous warning, and it is for this reason that we now clearly make known to you the fixed laws of our land . Still we cannot bear . to slay, exterminate or kill without prior warning, we say . We are now clearly making
 Let then your highness punish those of your subjects who may be criminal, do not endeavor to screen or conceal them, and thus you will secure peace and quietness to your possessions .
 Let your highness immediately, upon the receipt of this communication, inform us promptly of the state of matters, and of the measure you are pursuing utterly to put a stop to the opium evil .
 "These laborers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce," he says .
 The work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman . Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labor, the work has lost all individuality .
 He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him . "Only the simple and monotonious knack is required," he says .
 Cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race . The cost of production is limited to the workman's subsistence .
 The price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production . But the price of labour and production are equal to the cost of making it, the economist says .
 In proportion, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases . The wage increases in proportion to the repulsion of the job .
 Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist . Modern industry has transformed the little workshops of the patriarch into the factories of industrial capitalism .
 Masses of laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers . "Masses of workers" are organized "like soldiers," says the author .
 As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants . The industrial army is now the world's largest military force .
 Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself .
 The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty and hateful it is. The more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is, says the author of the book .
 The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, the more modern industry becomes developed, it will superseded by that of women . The labour of men superseded in modern industry, the writer argues .
 Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class . Differences of sex and age and age no longer have any social validity, says Simon Tisdall .
 All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex . All are tools of labour more or more expensive than sex .

 The 19th century and the turn of the 20th century are often described as a period when the power of many land-based empires diminished . nationalism became the most important organizing principle for societies around the world .
 Europe and America pursued overseas empires and expanded into Africa and East Asia, until a wave of “decolonization” after World War Two .
 Consider the decline of the empires we’ve already become familiar with in earlier chapters, in Asia, Europe, and the Muslim world . Consider the collapse of empires in Asia and Europe, in this chapter .
 They were territorial empires that had used military conquest to impose political control over wide expanses of land adjacent to their ancestral homelands . The empires were used by military conquest, imposing political control .
 They existed by providing a degree of civil and economic order, in exchange for taxes on the agricultural produce of the agrarian populations they conquered . They provided order by providing order in return for taxes .
 These empires left their citizens more or less alone . They speak their own languages, practice their own religions, and observe their own cultural traditions . These empires usually left their people alone .
 The janissaries of the Ottoman Empire took captives from conquered lands . Occasionally they took captives of conquered lands, like the Janissaries .
 In the process, the Spanish defeated several land-based indigenous empires such as the Aztecs, Inca, and Maya, and replaced the native rulers with Spanish Viceroys .
 The British, French, Dutch, and others soon followed the Iberians into the Caribbean and North America . The Iberianians became the first Europeans to settle in the Caribbean .
 All the European colonies in the Americas were controlled by their respective “mother” countries . The colonies were often required to trade only with the ‘mother’ economy . All the colonies had to send resources like silver and gold and agricultural products to Europe .
 The project of economic ‘neo-imperialism’ also appeared in the 19th century, especially in the new republics of Latin America . However, the new project of . economic “neo . imperialism” also appeared . in the . 19th
 In this case, supposedly independent countries that had recently won their independence from the Spanish and Portuguese empires, were dominated by European and United States investors, still providing raw materials for the ‘Great Powers” in exchange for finished industrial goods .
 As presented later, nearly all of these new nations became indebted to European banks . They faced the humiliation of ‘gunboat diplomacy” in which U.S. and European powers took over custom houses to force payment of loans .
 Before World War One, the decline of land-based empires was nearly complete, while overseas empires flourished . The decline of overseas empires was almost complete, but the decline was not nearly complete .
 Land-based empires began a precipitous decline after the Napoleonic wars . Some sooner than others, some sooner than some .
 Members of distinct cultural, religious, and linguistic groups began to demand more autonomy within these empires, which frequently led to the establishment of independent nationstates .
 In other cases, empires that resisted change were conquered by powerful nations expanding their overseas empires .
 The Sunni Muslim Ottoman homeland was present-day Turkey, which bordered on Orthodox Christian Russia to the north, the Catholic Habsburg Empire to the west, and the Shiite Iranians who succeeded the Safavid Empire in Persia to the east . The Ottoman Empire declined slowly during the 19th
 The Russians aided the Orthodox Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians in their successful struggles for independence . The Orthodox Greeks and Serbs fought for independence from the Ottoman Empire .
 The leaders of Russia wanted to reestablish Christian rule there . The Ottoman capital, Istanbul, had been Constantinople, home of the Byzantine Empire and of Greek Orthodox Christianity .
 The Greeks were the first to successfully free themselves from Ottoman rule in the 1820s . The Greeks are the first Greeks to successfully escape their Ottoman rule .
 Imperial Russia and the British sought more economic and political influence in the Eastern Mediterranean . They found support from Imperial Russia, but also from the British and French .
 The struggle for Greek freedom fired the imagination of the artists and writers of the ‘Romantic’ movement then flourishing in Europe . Greece was the birthplace of democracy and and home of classical literature and art .
 By the mid-19th century, disputes between European powers over what would happen to Ottoman territory caused the Crimean War . France, Great Britain, the Italian Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Ottomans opposed an expanding Russian Empire .
 The Crimean War was the first major war of the Industrial Age, featuring the use of railways, telegraphs, and modern ordnance like rifles and exploding naval artillery . It was also the first use of rail and telegraph technology in the war .
 The poem describes a frontal assault by a British light cavalry unit armed only with lances and sabers against an artillery battery at the battle of Balaclava in 1855 .
 Tennyson's poem praises the bravery of the cavalrymen who charged through the so-called Valley of Death . Events like these became symbols of the logistical and tactical mismanagement of the war effort .
 The conflict revealed the weakness of the Russian Empire, which fielded large armies but lagged in both tactics and technology . The conflict also revealed the strength of the Empire .
 In the treaty following the war, Russia was forced to remove its naval fleet from the Black Sea . The treaty followed the treaty forced Russia to remove it from the sea .
 Ali's son Muhammad Sa’id granted a land concession in 1854 to French businessman Ferdinand de Lesseps to dig a canal from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea . Ali modernized Egypt in many ways, while his son, Muhammad Sa'id, granted a . land concession
 The building of the Suez Canal, completed in 1869, was initially opposed by Great Britain . Great Britain feared its control by the French would shift the balance of power in Europe . The canal was completed by 1869 .
 The canal took NASA image of the Suez Canal from space, connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Mediterranean . It took eleven years to build, using Red Sea forced Egyptian labor .
 The Suez Canal Company was an international corporation . Its shares did not sell well outside France and Egypt . The canal company was founded in 1903 .
 Benjamin Disraeli bought the shares with an unsecured £4,000,000 loan from Baron Lionel de Rothschild . Sa’id’s son Ismail put Egypt's shares up for sale in Egypt in 1875 . British Prime Minister bought shares with a £4
 Britain sent troops to protect the canal during the Egyptian civil war in 1882 . In 1888 the canal was declared a neutral zone under British protection .
 Using the canal, British steamships were able to avoid sailing around Africa and reach India in two weeks instead of two months . The canal was used by the British to avoid the journey around Africa .
 The majority of people in these territories were Orthodox Christians . Although they belonged to distinct ethnic and linguistic groups, the majority of them were Orthodox Christian .
 When the Russian Empire’s ambitions were thwarted in the Crimean War, Russians were forced to confront their military incompetence and social backwardness . The Crimean War was Russia's first attempt to take over the Crimean Peninsula .
 Serfs were included in any property transaction among the landed gentry . Serfs tied peasants and their families to the land, and although they were not slaves, serfs included in property transactions .
 Tsar Alexander II declared an end to serfdom in 1861, shortly before President Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, during the U.S. Civil War . President Lincoln issued the proclamation in 1863 .
 Both countries were among the last in their respective regions to formally end forced labor obligations . Like the newly-freed’s in the U.S., the liberty of many former Russian serfs existed only on paper .
 The slowness of political and social change led to frustration among potential reformers . Instead of reformers, they instead turned to revolutionary action, often led by anarchists . Anarchists were often involved in revolutionary action .
 Anarchism is similar to socialism in its concept of class struggle, but anarchists believe that all forms of top-down control should be eliminated . Anarchy would allow humanity to thrive in smaller consensus-based entities .
 His son, Alexander III, rejected this political reform; he, in turn, was also murdered by anarchists, in 1894 . Alexander III was also killed by anarchists; his son rejected this reform .
 Nicholas II was open to any checks on his absolute power . His son, Nicholas II, was not open to checks on any checks . Nicholas II's son Nicholas II also had no checks on him .
 Dozens of ethnic and religious groups lived in the territories of the Russian Empire . Attempts at ‘russification’ were inconclusive .
 Poles, Finns, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and Romanians, among many others, chafed under the autocratic rule of the Tsars, and desired independence . They wanted independence and better economic opportunities in Russia .
 Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe often chose a new life in the United States rather than discrimination and persecution . Jews from these countries also often chose to move to the U.S. rather than persecution .
 Later pogroms, such as one in Odessa in 1905 in which hundreds of Jews lost their lives, received international condemnation and were presented as proof of Tsarist Russia’s backwardness .
 Jews had lived in the region for centuries, but they were always considered an ‘other’ by the Tsars . The Tsars restricted their ability to own land and to exercise certain professions . Jews were also restricted from owning land and exercising certain professions in Russia .
 Attacks on Jewish communities and neighborhoods—pogroms—occurred with frightening frequency from the 1880s until the eve of World War One . Attacks against Jewish communities from 1880s to the 1920s .
 Jews from these territories often chose immigration to the United States to flee discrimination and persecution . Later pogroms, such as the one in Odessa in 1905, received international condemnation and were presented as proof of Tsarist Russia's backwardness .
 The Spanish line died out in 1700, but the Austrian House of Habsburg would reign until 1918 . The Austrian line would last until the death of the Spanish in 1700 .
 At the end of the Napoleonic period, the Habsburg Empire dominated southeastern Europe, up to the frontiers of the Ottoman and Russians . The Empire was the heart of the continent's most populous region .
 The Habsburg monarchs supported Catholics of the Ottoman region, like the Croats . While the Tsars felt a special kinship with Orthodox Christians under Turkish rule .
 Until 1815, the Habsburgs had been the Holy Roman Emperors . During the Protestant Reformation, they fought to maintain Catholicism as the official religion of their realm .
 Although united by religion, the Habsburg empire was divided by a growing sense of nationality . The Habsberg empire was united by religious and nationalistic beliefs .
 German-speaking Austrian Habsburg emperors ruled Hungarians, Czechs, Ukrainians, Poles, Slovaks, Romanians, Jews, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, and Albanians . They ruled Hungary, Czech, Ukrainians and Slovaks .
 By the middle of the nineteenth century, many of these peoples wanted their own nations . By the mid-nineteen century, these peoples were in need of their own countries .
 The rebellions and revolutions of 1848 came close to breaking up the Habsburg territories in a wave of nationalist and socialist fervor . The revolutions came in the wake of the 1848 revolution .
 The revolutionaries did not achieve all of their goals, but serfdom was abolished . Several regions gained a greater degree of autonomy . Emperor Ferdinand I abdicated in favor of his nephew Franz Josef .
 Unification of Italy in 1860s and and Germany in 1870 allowed the Hungarians to achieve nearcomplete independence . Hungarians became the most numerous minority within the realm .
 Sse tan Sere 8 the Austro-Hungarian Ethnicities in the Austo-Hungary Empire Empire . The Austro -Hungarian Empire Empire was one of the world's most successful empires .
 Romanians demanded more autonomy from the Hungarian administration in Budapest . Czechs asked for the same from the Austrian government in Vienna . Romanians and Czechs demanded autonomy from Hungarian authorities .
 A united Germany, achieved in 1870, brought together an agricultural east with an industrialized west, creating an entirely new “Great Power” in Europe to rival Great Britain and France . The united Germany was achieved in 1881 .
 The new nation called itself the German Empire (Deutsches Reich) Its ambition to take a place at the table of imperial powers upset the post-Napoleonic European balance of power . It became a cause of the two world wars .
 Bismarck came to the conclusion that to counter Austria-Hungary, Prussia had to take the initiative and gather the German states under the Prussian king . He was not among the young Germans who had dreamed of unification .
 First, in 1864, he started a brief war with Denmark that brought together most of the northern German states as allies of Prussia . Then, he also started a war with the Danish kingdom of Denmark, which he fought against .
 A war with Austria in 1866 solidified these states in a confederation with Prussian King Wilhelm I . At the same time, the newly unified Italy took advantage of a weakened Austria to claim Italian-speaking territories .
 Napoleon Bonaparte counted on the neutrality of the other German states and on Austrian help, neither of which happened . Napoleon's nephew was president of France before declaring himself emperor in 1870 . Napoleon counted on neutrality of Germany and Austrian help from Austria .
 Prussia had one of the best-trained armies in Europe and surprised the French with their rapid advance . Prussia was one of Europe's best trained armies .
 A leaderless France could not halt the united German advance . The capital, Paris, was taken over by a socialist-inspired Commune .
 The French agreed to territorial losses as they formed a Third Republic . Otto von Bismarck painted when he was Prime Minister of Prussia .
 In early 1871, Bismarck initiated a gathering of the German princes at the French royal palace in Versailles, outside Paris, to join together as a new unified national state .
 The man in white is the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck, responsible for organizing the Empire . He was in charge of the German Empire, which was founded in Germany .
 A German empire created a new dynamic in diplomatic relations, based on French and German antagonism, forming new alliances and altering previous arrangements . A new French-German relationship with Germany led to the rise of the German empire .
 The FrancoPrussian War was the first of three major conflicts between the French and Germans over the next 75 years in which millions would die . The two countries have become strong allies, forming the primary economic and political relationship of the current European Union .
 If the French and Germans can set aside old conflicts and work together, perhaps Indians and Pakistanis, Sunnis and Shiites, and other “enemies’s” can eventually do the same .
 Britain held on to Canada and retained control of islands in the Caribbean . London’s bankers and British industry would dominate the finance and trade in the new Latin American republics .
 Unlike the Thirteen Colonies, Canada achieved its independence from Britain much more slowly, without a revolution . Canada achieved independence from the British Empire in 1867 .
 The French-speaking Quebecois and the British in Ontario could easily have been at each other’s throats . But anxiety over an invasion from the United States (which was tried unsuccessfully in 1775 and 1812) held a fragile alliance together .
 Sir John A Macdonald, first Prime Minister North America Act of 1867 of Canada . created the Dominion of Canada by combining Quebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and New Brunswick .
 MacDonald knew that like the U.S., Canada’s eastern and western coastal regions needed a transcontinental railroad to bind them together . MacDonald knew he needed a railroad to connect the two regions together .
 Railroad operates mostly just north of the border, although several lines connected to U.S. cities such as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Chicago . Railroad operates mainly north of border .
 The British had also claimed Australia, which they settled in the late 18th century with convicts .
 Most of the crimes were petty or related to debt . Some were political, such as the Irish condemned for protesting English rule . Others were petty, while others were politically motivated .
 New Zealand was settled in the early 19th century through a private company . The company followed the model established in the colonization of some of the Thirteen Colonies . New Zealand is one of the world's largest colonies .
 Native peoples lost land in much the same manner as in British North America . In both cases, the native peoples lost their land .
 In Australia, the vast continent allowed for the aborigines to retreat, until environmental and other factors brought them into increasing contact with the settlers and their descendants .
 India was the most important colony for the British, determining much of its international diplomacy until after World War Two . India was a key part of the British foreign policy .
 The Mughal Empire was entering a long period of decline after its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries . The British East India Company began its conquest of India in the 1700s .
 Company took advantage of the empire’s weakness to expand its trading activities . Company slowly took over regional principalities that split off from Mughal control . Company took over regions that split from the empire and took over .
 By the 1700s, Indian tea had become an important part of the British diet . In 1778, colonists dumped Indian tea into the Boston Harbor in protest against taxes on the product in Boston .
 By the middle of the 19th century, the Company controlled most of mainland India, Pakistan, Burma, and Bangladesh, as well as Sri Lanka . By the end of the century, it had control of most of the country .
 The Company shifted its policy away from simply trading, and began reorganizing the Indian economy, clearing forests and establishing widespread cultivation of tea, coffee, cotton, and opium for use in China . The Company cleared forests and established widespread cultivation .
 The Crown took over direct control of the colony in 1858 after an uprising called the Sepoy Mutiny . India was a producer of agricultural products and raw materials for Britain’s growing industrial economy .
 This closed economic system was attractive to both older and newer European empires . It set off a scramble for colonies in Africa in the late-19th century, setting off an imperial scramble .
 The British administration of India also provided a model for other European imperialists . The British government of India was the model for imperialists in Europe .
 The tiny island kingdom could not direct all of the affairs of their Indian possession . Instead, trained locals needed to aid in governance .
 This process began under the East India Company with the formation of native army and police forces . It soon included educated local administrators who spoke English and understood imperial laws and edicts .
 The model proved so effective in India that Indian immigrants often followed the British to their new colonies in Africa . Indians operated the railways and postal service, and Indian carpenters and bricklayers constructed government offices and private homes .
 Indian shopkeepers played an enormous role in the local economies of these new colonies well into the 20th century . Shopkeepers played a vital role in local economies in the new colonies of India .
 Indians even migrated to Great Britain’s territories in the Caribbean as indentured servants . In Guyana, in northern South America, over 40% of the population is of “India-Indian” descent .
 The story of Mahatma Gandhi, who later helped lead India to independence, is an example of a native trained to manage the Empire . Gandhi was trained by a native in India to manage India's Empire .
 Gandhi went to London to study law . Gandhi was educated in a British school in India . He studied law in London and later moved to India .
 On graduating he went to South Africa to serve the British Empire as a lawyer for twenty-five years . He then began a new career advocating for Indian independence . He served in South Africa for 25 years before moving to India .
 Ho Chi Minh applied for admission to the French academy in Marseilles that trained imperial administrators . He would fight with and then against United States forces for the independence of Vietnam .
 If the school had accepted him, history might have been quite different . The school accepted him as a student at the age of 16 .

 Some of the slaveowners among the Founders of the United States thought that slavery would not be a permanent institution in the new country . Slavery, Expansion, and Civil War are key issues in America's history .
 At the constitutional convention in 1787, they agreed to abolish the slave trade in the U.S. starting in 1808 . The slave trade was abolished in the United States .

 The leaders of national liberation often came out of these experiences reasoning that since they were already experienced at running their own nations as administrators for the empires, it was time for the imperialists to leave .
 The war was full of inspirational examples of Europeans and Asians who fought side by side against the fascist occupiers in their conquered nations .
 The process was accelerated by the strain of war on the European imperialists. The process of war was accelerated in the 1930s and 1940s . The result of the conflict in the Middle East was accelerated .
 France and the Netherlands had been conquered and themselves occupied as imperial subjects by the Germans, while the British were greatly weakened . The British had been greatly weakened.
 British leaders hoped and expected to expand their empire, which they now renamed a commonwealth . The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had no intention of giving back Iran’s Winston Churchill waving the Victory sign .
 The UK was having trouble feeding and housing its own population and leaned on U.S. aid like a crutch . This may seem a to the crowd in Whitehall on the day he strange attitude .
 The timing of national liberation was complicated by the growing conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . It was both a competition to dominate territory and control alliances .
 This conflict was known as the ‘Cold War,’ since the two countries never directly attacked one another . This conflict is known as “The Cold War’s Cold War .
 Instead they fought a series of proxy wars that occurred within the context of decolonization . Instead of fighting for independence, they fought for power in the form of proxy war .
 Each superpower competed to recruit more new nations to their side, pouring military and economic aid into the new developing countries . Each superpower invested heavily in developing nations .
 In the Philippines, the U.S. government handed over power to a local Filipino government within a year of ending the war with Japan . The Philippines, for example, the United States handed power to local Filipino governments .
 The Americans fully appreciated the sacrifices made by the Filipinos under Japanese occupation and the contributions they had made to their own liberation . The Americans . appreciated the contributions made to the Filipino .
 Propaganda poster depicting the Philippine of the Philippines on July 4, ene 1946 . President Harry Truman recognized the independence from the Philippines .
 American and Filipino governments worked out arrangements allowing the United States to retain dozens of military bases and for American businesses to have preferential access to the raw materials and markets of the newly independent nation .
 Peaceful political pressure from organized movements also led to liberation . Sometimes, peaceful political pressure led to the death of many people .
 Indian independence is the first and prime example of how nonviolent protest, boycotts, and moral suasion could result in freedom . Indian independence, examined below, was the first example of nonviolent protest to achieve freedom .
 European imperialists were unwilling to let go of their colonies despite the desires of the colonized . However, there are also many cases in which independence could only be achieved through a more violent guerrilla struggle .
 Indian infantrymen of the 7th Rajput Regiment about to go on patrol, 1944 . They were the first Indian soldiers to join the British Army .
 When Britain called Indians to arms a second time, the Muslim League supported the British recruitment . The Muslim League helped the British recruit the British forces .
 However, the Indian National Congress demanded independence before it would agree to help Britain again .
 When the Congress began a ‘Quit India’ campaign in August 1942, the British imprisoned tens of thousands of leaders for the war’s duration until June 1945 .
 Mohandas Gandhi was among those jailed; he was released in May 1944 due to health concerns . Gandhi was released from prison on health concerns in 1944 .
 British war strategy led to a major famine in Bengal in 1943 (modern-day Bangladesh, at the mouth of the Ganges River) About 8 million people died of starvation .
 About a half million Indian children on a Calcutta street published in Hindu refugees foiled . The children were killed and dying in the wake of a rising tide of violence .
 The British decided to adopt a “scorched-earth” policy in southern Bengal, burning thousands of boats and destroying rice crops so they would not fall into the hands of the Japanese, who they assumed would soon extend their invasion . At the same time, the British decided
 Poor harvests and wartime inflation in late 1942-early 1943 sent internal rural refugees into Calcutta, the Bengali capital, exacerbating the crisis .
 The British War Cabinet stalled in sending needed grain to the starving Bengalis . Perhaps as policy, perhaps because of the strain on wartime shipping . The War Cabinet was unable to send needed grain .
 Very little sympathy was shown for the plight of the Bengalese by the leaders of Great Britain . Great Britain did not show any sympathy for their plight .
 Churchill was not only aware of Gandhi, he was aware of the importance to India to the British war effort . Churchill was also aware of India's importance to the war effort in India .
 The British government borrowed billions of pounds from India to finance the war . In addition to 2. million soldiers, the British government had 2.2 million soldiers .
 India was no longer merely a site of famines, it was becoming a source of essential supplies . And India was not only a site for famines but it was also a major source of supplies . India was becoming an essential supply source for essential supplies in the 1930s .
 Indian independence was complicated by internal divisions, some exacerbated by the British during many decades of imperial rule . Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi were assassinated in 1946 .
 The British had encouraged division between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim populations . Hindu troops were sent to police Muslims, and vice versa .
 Gandhi sought to eliminate the Hindu caste system which deprived the poorest Indians of hope . Gandhi wanted to eliminate caste system that deprived the poor of hope, he said .
 Gandhi wished for an independent, united India after the end of British rule . Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League lobbied for the establishment of two states in India .
 Jinnah proposed the creation of a Hindu India and an Islamic “Pure Land” called Pakistan . Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan . He proposed a Hindu and Islamic India and Pakistan .
 Jinnah’s position was embraced by Hindu nationalists who wanted to be rid of the Muslim minority . Jinnah was a leader of the Hindu Nationalist Party .
 As independence was being negotiated after the war, escalating religious violence suggested that British withdrawal might result in a bloody civil war .
 The new Muslim nation at the time included both the present territory of Pakistan in the west and the eastern region now called Bangladesh . The new country was formed in the 1920s .
 After independence in August 1947, the partition created a central Hindu nation with two borders into Muslim Pakistan India to the east and west . After independence, Pakistan India became a Muslim nation .
 Millions died during the chaos of the migration and the refugee crises that followed . Millions of people fled their homes to join the new nations that Ceylon, and Union of Burma .
 Gandhi was assassinated shortly after he achieved his dream of independence . Gandhi himself was assassinated by one such extremist shortly after achieving independence .
 In 1947, a local Hindu prince convinced the British that the majority-Muslim region should stay with India . The majority of the Muslim region was ruled by the British in 1947 .
 The Government of Pakistan and many local Kashmiris continue to protest this, causing internal and external conflicts . Kashmiris are still protesting this, leading to internal conflicts .
 Kashmir dispute is a legacy of imperialism that may still endanger regional or even global peace . Since both India and Pakistan are now nuclear nations, the Kashmir dispute may still be a legacy .
 India was not the only region of the world from which Britain walked away soon after World War Two . Israel Israel was also the region from which the British walked away from .
 After World War I, Britain had been given a “mandate” to administer Palestine along with the oil-rich regions of Arabia and Iraq . After World WWI, Britain was given a "mandate" to administer the region .
 Between the wars the British continued to allow Zionists, advocates of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, to purchase land and move into the region . Between the war and the end of the Second World War the British allowed Zionists to buy land .
 Migration of Zionist Jews to the region had begun in the late nineteenth century . Migration of Zionists to Israel began in the mid-nineteenth century .
 Tel Aviv is one of the prime examples of the Bauhaus architectural style popular in Germany in the 1920s . This “second wave’s” of Zionist settlers included dedicated socialists who created cooperative farms called kibbutzim . Tel Aviv was one of Israel's
 Palestinian Arabs had lived in the region for centuries . However, accelerating Zionist immigration increased tensions with the Palestinian Arabs .
 Competition for land and water resulted in violent riots between Arabs and Zionists in 1921, and a longer Arab revolt in Palestine from 1936 to 1939 . The Arab revolt lasted between 1936 and 1939, with Arab revolt lasting until the end of the decade .
 The British considered a petition to allow 100,000 refugee survivors of the Nazi camps to resettle in Palestine, but hesitated due to opposition from Palestinian Arabs and the nearby Arab states . The petition was rejected .
 Zionist settlers had already formed a mutual defense force, the Haganah, in the 1920s . Zionist settlers and Israeli settlers formed mutual defense forces in Israel .
 After the war, the Haganah turned to sabotage against the British occupation and organizing illicit arms shipments . After the conflict, the organization organized illicit weapons shipments to the British .
 More radical terrorist organizations also formed, including the Irgun, which in 1946 bombed the British headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people . The Irgun was the first group to attack the British in 1946 .
 The Irgun also led a terror attack on the Palestinian town of Deir Hassin in 1948, in which over a hundred perished, including women and children . Over a hundred people perished in the attack .
 The Deir Hassin massacre has served as a rallying cry and a justification for terror attacks against Israelis by different Palestinian-related terrorist groups ever since . Israeli government: The massacre has since been used to justify attacks on Israelis .
 In 1947, the British relinquished their “mandate” over Palestine to the new United Nations . The U.N. tried to develop a new map for a Jewish homeland while taking into account the presence of Arab Palestinians .
 The Zionists received more land than could be justified by their numbers at the time, as well as some of the more valuable agricultural and water resources . Zionists were able to get more land .
 As the British withdrew in May 1948, Israel declared its independence based on the United Nations borders, which the local Arabs and the neighboring Arab countries had rejected . The Arab nations had rejected the borders .
 Israel’s new neighbors immediately declared war, but the new nation had powerful allies . Israel was willing to fight for its survival . Israel's new neighbors declared war but Israel had allies .
 The Israelis claimed they needed to have a wider defensive perimeter and that the Arab Palestinians had abandoned many of their towns anyway . Many thought the Arabs would win a decisive victory .
 A series of wars in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982 continued the conflict . The conflict began in the early 1950s .
 Israel expanding as Palestine shrinks, in an image produced by Palestinian activists . The image was taken by activists in Gaza and Palestine .
 Arab world considers Israel an arbitrary creation of western powers . The Arab world refuses to recognize Israel as a legitimate state .
 Peace processes with individual Arab nations have brought agreements and diplomatic recognition from Egypt and Jordan . Egypt returned Sinai Peninsula, taken in the 1967 war, to Israel in 1979 . Jordan relinquished its claim to the Palestinian West Bank of the Jordan River in 1994 .
 The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Sudan will recognize Israel in 2020 . They want to qualify for U.S. military and economic aid from the U.K.
 Reluctance to abandon colonies was especially a problem in Africa, where there were British settlers rather than administrators . The British colonialists were reluctant to abandon their colonies .
 British settlers occupied all the best farmland in Kenya, Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta, 1966 . By the early twentieth century, 30,000 a. million Kenyans were without .
 The settlers were people like Isek Dinesen, who wrote of her experiences in Kenya in her 1937 book Out of Africa . Most were less respectful and interested in the natives than she .
 Blundel despised the local Kikuyu tribes and believed the “Kukes” as he called them had only “come out of the trees” in the last 50 years, and probably as a result of contact .
 The attitude of British farmers in Kenya was much like the relationship two centuries earlier between English colonists in North America and the Native Americans . The relationship between British farmers and Native Americans is similar to that of two centuries ago .
 In Kenya, a resistance movement called Mau Mau began in 1952 when natives restricted to reservations in their own country revolted . Mau Mau was a movement that fought for reservations in the country .
 After World War II, 1.25 million Kikuyu had 2,000 square miles of marginal farmland to feed themselves . 380,000 British settlers had 12,000 sq miles of fertile hills in the fertile hills of the Central and Rift Valleys .
 The Mau Mau uprising protested this injustice and the British colonial government responded . Mau Mau is the name of the Mau Mau people who protested against injustice in colonial Britain .
 The uprising lasted until 1963, partly because white settlers could not easily abandon their property and go back to Britain . The uprising was largely due to the fact that white settlers were not able to leave their property .
 Power in Kenya eventually shifted from the British colonial government to a native government . Initially made up of many members of the Kenyan African National Union that had led the resistance .
 Jomo Kenyatta was Kenya’s first indigenous Prime Minister from 19638 to 1964 . He was President of Kenya and led the KANU party until his death in 1978 .
 Kenyatta, like other leaders such as Gandhi and Ho Chi Minh, had travelled internationally . Kenyata, like others, travelled internationally.
 Kenyatta was imprisoned from 1954 to 1961 for allegedly leading the rebellion . He became leader of the party and nation when released from prison .
 Kenyatta initially tried to heal the nation by downplaying the atrocity of the recent war . He welcomed the multinational corporations that dominated the Kenyan economy . The government has been criticized for its response to the war .
 Kenyatta was often accused of being a socialist, but he was also hated by the British settlers for being married to a white woman . He was often married to white women in Kenya .
 Kenyatta was regarded by many Africans as a strong Pan-Africanist . He was hailed as the Hero of the Kikuyu and hailed as a hero of the country .
 After the war the French fully expected to regain their colonial possessions in Africa and Asia and resume where they had left off . Although France had been conquered and occupied by Germany, after the war it was hoped to regain its colonial possessions .
 In Algeria, revolutionaries had been organizing to resist French imperialism since before the war . In Algeria they were fighting for independence against French imperialism .

 FLN applied guerrilla ‘hit and run’ tactics as well as terrorism and torture of both French pieds noirs and Africans suspected of supporting the regime . The FLN used guerrilla “hit-and-run” tactics .
 By 1956 there were more than 400,000 French troops in Algeria . The French were equally brutal, and by 1956 there had been more than 300,000 .
 The French military lost 25,000 troops and about 3,000 European civilians were killed in the conflict . The French government lost about 25 per cent of its troops in the war .

 Ho Chi Minh worked as a kitchen helper on a steamship from Saigon to Marseille in 1911 . As a young man, he had worked on a ship that took him to Saigon from Paris to France in 1911.
 He visited the United States several times in his travels and later claimed to have met Black nationalist Marcus Garvey . He claimed to be able to travel to the U.S. and claim to meet Garvey in America .
 Ho began to write articles that were noticed in Moscow and he was invited to visit the Soviet Union . Ho began writing articles and was invited by Moscow to write about Soviet affairs . Ho's articles were noticed and he visited Moscow in the USSR .
 When Chiang Kai-shek cracked down on communists in China, Ho returned to Moscow and then moved on to Thailand . Ho moved to Thailand when he was forced to leave the country .
 Ho was arrested in Hong Kong in 1931 but escaped and returned to Russia . Ho was captured in 1931, but escaped from Hong Kong and returned .
 Ho returned to China in 1988 as an advisor to the Chinese Communist army . Ho is now a senior member of the Communist Party of China's military .
 In 1941 he returned to Vietnam to lead the independence movement there . He returned to the country in 1941 to fight for independence .
 Ho wrote a declaration of independence for Vietnam based on the United States Declaration from 1776 . Ho wrote the declaration at the end of World War II . Ho's declaration was based on that of the U.S. Declaration .
 Ho repeatedly petitioned President Harry S Truman to recognize Vietnam, citing the Atlantic Charter, but Truman never responded . Ho repeatedly asked President Truman to acknowledge Vietnam .
 British and Chinese troops occupied the country in support of France . Meanwhile, British and China troops occupy the country . French and Chinese forces occupied the area .
 Vietnamese rioted and killed a hundred or so French citizens, and in retaliation French troops armed Japanese prisoners of war and massacred over 6,000 Vietnamese . In retaliation, French troops killed over 600,000 French citizens .
 This is the same pattern of asymmetrical force used by empires against their subjects throughout the colonial period . This was the same patterns used by empire against its subjects throughout their colonial period.
 The story of Vietnam is only half over; we will return to it in the next chapter when we discuss the Cold War . However, the story of the Vietnam War is not over; it is only about half over .
 Kenya, Algeria, and Vietnam were not the only places where the imperial powers and their international allies responded violently to movements of national liberation among the colonized .
 French killed 80,000 in Madagascar in 1947 when the people of that island supported independence . For example, the French killed more than 100,000 people in 1947 .
 The Indonesian War of Independence raged from the former Dutch East Indies declaration of independence in 1945 to The Netherlands’ recognition of their claims in 1949 . The Dutch declared independence in 1949 and The Netherlands recognized their claims .

 Growing fears of international communism pushed the U.S. government into supporting some of these actions . Growing fears prompted the government to support some of the actions .
 The U.S. helped Korean militias massacre about 60,000 members of a peasant insurgency . Although the Americans had peacefully let go of the Philippines, the United States helped Korea .
 The Korean Peninsula was divided at the end of World War Two, like Germany, into Soviet and United States occupation zones .
 Rivals backed communist and non-communist leaders in North and South Korea . Unsurprisingly, the two rivals backed each other .
 The resulting conflict, the Korean War, will be examined in more detail in the next chapter on the Cold War . The Korean War is the result of the resulting conflict .
 The newly-founded countries in Africa and Asia faced the challenges of establishing borders, forming new governments, building economic self-reliance, controlling natural resources .
 In previous chapters, we have seen how the new nations in Latin America had confronted similar issues since the early nineteenth century . The new Latin American nations are confronted with similar issues .
 Other older but less-industrialized countries, like Iran, also addressed questions of development and national sovereignty . Iran is one of the few countries in the Middle East .
 One of the major challenges faced by the new nations was the problem of borders . The new nations were born of immigrants .
 The administrative boundaries drawn by the European imperial powers did not always follow any logic that served the colonized peoples . The administrative borders drawn by imperial powers were not always followed any logic .
 Sub-Saharan Africa’s division by the European powers had also haphazardly thrown together peoples who wanted separate nations . Sub-Sahara Africa's division by European powers also thrown together .
 Violent conflicts based on tribal loyalties have caused civil wars and political instability . Violent conflicts are often based on tribes' loyalty to each other . Violence has led to civil wars, political instability and civil wars .
 The Igbo people tried to form a separate nation in Nigeria in 1965, the three-year civil war that followed killed thousands before Biafra was defeated . Thousands of people died in the war between the Igbo and the Nigerian government .
 French journalist Gilles Caron photographs the starving children of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War . The disputed region is petroleum-rich (Nigeria leads Africa in oil production)
 Nigerian government. resentful that their oil wealth . seems to benefit the rest of the country more than it serves them . Nigeria's oil wealth seems to be better served by the rest .
 Although no tribe advocates establishing their own independent state in Kenya, conflicting tribal loyalties often spill over into political competition .
 Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta tended to favor his Kikuyu people, who were a plurality but not a majority, during his long presidency .
 It is one thing to write a constitution, and quite another to actually follow it . But it is one more important to follow it, and it's one more difficult to do so, says David Cameron .
 Like the older republics in Latin America, many new nations suffered through periods of authoritarian rule . Many new nations have suffered from authoritarian rule, including Mexico .
 Often, the military would step in and overthrow a democratically-elected government in times of perceived or actual economic or political chaos . The military has overthrown many governments in the past .
 The colonial powers had trained militaries as well as educating local administrators . Army officers often felt that they were in a better position to rule their countries than incompetent politicians .
 Similar arguments had been made by fascists and authoritarians in interwar Europe . The mistakes of the imperialists were often repeated in their former colonies .
 The Cold War complicated this situation, as fear of communist-led “wars of national liberation” often caused the U.S. and other Western “democracies” to support repressive military dictatorships . Fear of ‘war’s ‘w
 India successfully embraced democracy and remains today the largest democracy by population . India is today the world's largest democracy .
 Sikhs advocating for more power in Hindu India murdered Indira Gandhi in 1984 . Ethnic Tamil separatists assassinated her son Rajiv in 1991 . Sikhs and ethnic Tamil separatists also assassinated her husband Rajiv Gandhi .
 Pakistan has been ruled by their military more often than not since independence . On the other hand, Pakistan has a history of being ruled by the military . Pakistan has ruled by its own military since independence from 1947 .
 Pakistan did not benefit from an initial long premiership by its founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah . Jinnah died barely a year after independence of tuberculosis and lung cancer . Unlike in Nehru’s India, Pakistan didn’t benefit from the initial premiership .
 The Pakistani military has intervened into national government in the past . Internal and international crises led to repeated interventions by the Pakistani military .
 Even today the military plays an independent, often secretive role in Pakistan, especially in foreign policy . But even today, the military still plays a key role in the country's politics .
 All of the new nations were faced with the question of how to develop their economies . The new nations faced the challenge of developing their own economies .
 Some governments were inspired by apparent rapid industrial growth in the Soviet Union under Stalin’s Five-Year Plans . Others embraced the role of providing natural resources to the mature industrial economies of the West .
 Independent economic self-reliance was often difficult to achieve when industries and public utilities remained foreign-owned . Public utilities and industries often remain foreign owned by foreign owners .
 Some new governments nationalized these businesses, so that the nation owned and operated them in the name of the people rather than for the profits of foreign shareholders . Some governments nationalize these businesses so that they are owned by the people .
 In India, Nehru’s government nationalized the railroads, electric utilities, and communication systems . The government also nationalized railroads and electric utilities in India .
 Many new African and Asian countries did the same. Seeing the results of India’s actions, many new African nations joined the same .
 Critics of nationalized industries argued that like the collectivized agriculture and industry of the Soviet Union, these businesses faced no competition . Critics argued that the nationalization of industries was a model of Soviet-era collectivism .
 The foreign businesses that had been pushed out supported this view, and a reaction to nationalization, privatization, began in the 1980s . The foreign firms were pushed out of the country .
 In India the push for privatization was led by Rajiv Gandhi, the grandson of the leader who had led nationalization efforts .
 In privatization, government-run industries were sold back to the private sector . Foreign investors often included, once again, foreign investors in the process .
 Newly-privatized industries often initially embraced cost-cutting efficiencies and more competent management . Repairing broken-down electrical grids and rail lines is a key part of the privatization of power .
 Some leaders once again seek more benefits for the entire nation . However, as profits were once again exported abroad or held by a tiny local elite, there has been a push back against privatization .
 In recent decades, a leader in the political push for privatization has been the International Monetary Fund . The IMF was established in 1944 at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire .
 There were two architects of the meeting and the global financial plan that came from it . The meeting was the first meeting of the world's two largest economies .
 John Maynard Keynes was the British economist who pioneered the ‘demandside’ economic theory that people like U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had adopted to confront the Great Depression . Keynes pioneered the 'demandside' economic theory .
 Keynes’ claim was that by spending money, the federal government could jump-start the economy, Harry Dexter White and John Maynard cheats jobs, and put the Keynes at Bretton Woods, 1944. money in people’s pockets that would enable them to buy consumer products
 Keynes' plan was temporarily derailed by war production and rationing . Many economists think deficit spending and government borrowing was the key to ending the Depression . Keynes was right, but it's unclear to many economists that he was right .
 Keynes was chief advisor to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain at the time of the Bretton Woods Conference . Keynes was the chief advisor at the times of the conference .
 The American, Harry Dexter White, worked closely with Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. The American was the Treasury Secretary of the 1920s and 1930s .
 White opposed the ICU and instead proposed an International Stabilization Fund that would help debtor nations maintain their balance of trade . White opposed an ICU, instead proposed a fund to help countries maintain balance trade balance .
 This grew into the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which became the World Bank . The World Bank was founded in the 1930s and is now the world's largest bank .
 The ICU and the “bancor” were rejected by the U.S. to protect the leading position of the dollar in the world economy . Another reason the United States rejected the ICU was to protect its leading position in the global economy . The U.N
 The U.S. had the strongest economy in the world at the end of World War II . They also dictated the trade provisions agreed to at the conference .
 The major provisions of the agreement were a foreign exchange system with the United States Dollar as its base currency . The agreement also includes a pledge by members to convert their currency to gold for trade-related demands .
 This would prevent debtor nations from escaping their obligations to creditors by simply inflating their currencies . It would prevent debt-stricken countries from escaping obligations by inflating currencies to avoid creditors .
 All members had to pitch in to the new bank’s assets, although the United States put up most of the money .
 Bretton Woods also drafted a set of trade-related recommendations . International Trade Organization was proposed, with a goal of reducing tariffs . An International Trade Organisation was proposed .
 The United States Senate did not ratify the ITO’s charter . The U.S. Senate was not interested in ceding its authority over tariffs to an international organization .
 The less aggressive General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was adopted in its place . It was replaced with a less aggressive version of the agreement .
 IMF was designed to oversee the international monetary and financial systems . The IMF is designed to monitor member nations and monitor member countries .
 The United States undermined this mission when it went off the gold standard in197l. The U.S. undermined it when it undermined its mission to set up the world's gold standard . The world's first gold standard was set up by the United States in the 1970s .
 Nixon feared that foreign holders of dollars would demand conversion to gold, which would wipe out the U.S. gold reserves . Inflationary government spending on both the war in Viet Nam and the War on Poverty begun by Lyndon Johnson .
 The next largest national gold reserve, roughly 3. metric tons, belongs to Germany . Losing their original reasons for existence, the IMF and World Bank were forced to adapt .
 IMF began using its ability to loan interest-free development money to debtor nations as a way to intervene in and direct the economic policies of the borrowers . The IMF is now using the funds to direct the policies of borrowers .
 IMF's stated aim was to avoid or mitigate financial crises, using the “conditionality” of their loans . IMF: "Conditionality’s" loans are to avoid financial crises using the IMF's loans to mitigate crises . IMF says it will continue to work to avoid
 IMF now analyses nations’ economic policies and offers ‘advice’ which must be taken in order to receive IMF loans . The IMF is now analyzing countries’ policies and advising them to take the advice they need .
 IMF and the World Bank require Structural Adjustment Programs . The IMF and World Bank requires changes to the economy . The changes are called Structural Adaptation Programs .
 They typically include deregulation, privatization, and removal of trade barriers . Deregration and privatization are key to removing barriers to trade trade .
 All of these measures have been criticized by debtor nations as being more beneficial for the lenders in developed industrialized nations rather than for borrowers in the developing world .
 Other structural adjustments can include reducing trade deficits through currency devaluation . Austerity programs to decrease budget deficits, eliminating social welfare programs, cutting public services, focusing output on resource extraction .
 This bundle of structural adjustment programs is known as the Washington Consensus . It is associated with neoliberalism or market fundamentalism, which we will discuss in a later chapter . This current bundle of adjustment programs are known as Washington's "Washington Consensus"
 IMF policy is designed to liberalize trade, deregulate and privatize industries, and protect property rights above all other concerns . Even in its more modest formulation, IMF policy has been criticized for being too restrictive .
 The Green Revolution began in the 1960s in a research station on the edge of the Mexican desert . Agricultural yields have improved dramatically in the past few decades .
 Norman Borlaug developed a disease-resistant strain or dwarf wheat that increased yields of the grain worldwide . The scientist most associated with these advances is an agronomist who developed the dwarf wheat strain .
 Borlaug’s education included a stint in the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression .
 He later remembered that seeing the effect of hunger on people in America ‘left scars’ on him and motivated him to try to solve the problems of supplying food to a growing population .
 Borlaug earned a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of M. in 1942 .
 The Cooperative Wheat Research Program is a joint venture of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture . After a couple of years with DuPont, he joined the cooperative Wheat Research Production Program .
 Borlaug found that local Mexican farmers resisted planting wheat because a fungus called stem rust reduced their yields so much they couldn’t make a living .
 A related problem with wheat farming in Mexico was that the plants grew too tall when heavily fertilized and then “lodged’s” or fell over prior to harvest . The problem is that when fertilized heavily, the plants grow too tall and then "lod
 Borlaug and his team bred a new strain of dwarf wheat that would not grow too tall when fertilized and that also resisted rust . The new dwarf wheat is not only resistant to rust, but also resists rust . Borraug says the dwarf wheat will be used in the future
 The process took ten years and over 6,000 cross-breeding experiments between different types of wheat . It took 10 years to complete . The process was carried out between different wheat types .
 The new wheat had the additional advantage of being able to be planted twice per year . The wheat was planted twice a year and can be planted in two years .
 It took Borlaug a while to convince local farmers to try his new hybrid . They could see his fields and they were finally convinced .
 In the 1960s, as the program was becoming successful in Mexico, it was exported to India, which was facing famine . The program is now being used in India, where it was exporting to the country .
 American farmers shipped a fifth of their wheat production to India in 1966 and 1967 . The U.S. farmers shipped the majority of their crop to India from 1966-1967 .
 Wheat yields increased from 12. million tons in 1965 to 20. million ton in 1970 . Wheat yields rose from 12 million tons to 20 million tons per year in 1965 .
 By 1974 India was self-sufficient in all cereal grains and the USAID (US Agency for International Development) began calling Borlaug's work a Green Revolution .
 Since the 1960s India’s food production has increased faster than population growth . Food production has grown faster than the population growth rate since then .
 India’s improved crop yields have made it a net exported of wheat . India is now a net export net exporter of wheat, driven by Borlaug's improved wheat .
 India began exporting wheat regularly in the 1970s and since 1980 has exported wheat every year except three years except three . Since 1980, the country has exported every year since then except three.

 We'll look at how these people consolidated their power in the new Russia when we discuss Globalization in the next chapter of this chapter .
 At its most basic, globalization refers to business activities and the actions of governments beginning to be conducted on a worldwide scale . globalization is defined as business and government activities that are conducted worldwide .
 As we’ve seen, this has been happening throughout the modern period we've been covering, if not before . As we've seen, it’s not the first time this has happened in modern history .
 The voyages of Zheng He, the European colonial project in the Americas, the Atlantic Slave Trade, and the activities of the British East India Company in India and China were all conducted at a worldwide scale, and all had commercial elements .
 Conflicts such as the Seven Years War, the War of 1812, and World Wars I and II have also involved multiple continents . Conflicts like the Seven years War and War of the 1812 have also been involved in multiple continents.
 Twentieth-century economic colonialism involving oil was not limited to the Persian Gulf . It was not only that oil was in the Gulf, but it was also in the Middle East .
 Mexico was a heavy supplier of oil to the United States in the 1920s . As we have seen, before Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia became leading producers, Mexico was heavy supplier .
 In 1988, Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas invoked the new, 1917 Mexican Constitution to nationalize all oil production in Mexico . The 1917 Constitution was invoked by President Carden as part of the new constitution .
 The constitution, written during the Mexican Revolution, stated that the nation owned all the subsoil assets of Mexico . Cardenas formed the government-owned oil company PEMEX to extract and refine Mexican petroleum .
 Franklin Roosevelt’s administration acknowledged the right of the Mexican people to control their own resources . Although the corporations (particularly Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil) objected loudly, the administration was busy implementing the New Deal .
 The advent of World War II encouraged the Allied nations to put anti-fascist solidarity before the losses of a couple of U.S. corporations .
 In 1941 a reform government gained power which quickly passed the Hydrocarbons Law of 1943 which allowed the government to claim 50% of the profits of the oil industry . The law was quickly passed by the government in 1943 . In 1941 the government gained control of the country's oil industry and
 The outbreak of World War II increased demand for oil to such an extent that the government was able to grant several new concessions in spite of the tax . The 50% tax was introduced in 1941 .
 The postwar explosion of automobile ownership in the U.S. continued to drive demand and push oil prices higher . Venezuelan production increased in the post-war era .
 Oil was a mixed blessing for Venezuela, providing high levels of revenue for the government . But it also prevented Venezuelan industry from diversifying . Venezuela's oil wealth has been a source of instability in the country .
 Venezuela used its oil revenue to pay for a wide range of social welfare programs for its people . In recent decades, Venezuela used it oil revenue for a social welfare program . Venezuela's oil revenue has been used to fund social programs .
 The USS. criticized these policies as socialist, but they are rarely done without widespread popular support in Venezuela . Venezuela's policies have widespread support in the country, but the US has criticized them .
 Hugo Chavez, who was president from 1998 to his death in 2018, gave free heating oil to hundreds of thousands of poor people in the U.S. and Europe . Hugo Chavez criticized the United States government vehemently but also continued the Venezuelan policy of giving free heating .
 After increasing during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s and then peaking during Russia’s invasion of Afghanistan in the early 1980s, oil prices languished in the late 80s, exacerbating the Soviet Union's economic problems . Oil prices peaked in the 1980s during Russia
 In the early 1990s after the Soviet breakup, Russia began exporting millions of barrels daily into the world market . Millions of barrels of oil were exported daily in the 1990s .
 The dissolution of the U.S.R. and the Warsaw Pact accelerated the globalization of commerce . The collapse of the United States and the Soviet Union paved the way for global commerce .
 Globalization in new phase is characterized by increased foreign investment by transnational corporations, privatization of state enterprises, free movement of capital across national borders, and reduction of tariffs that impede the movement of products .
 A wave of deregulation accompanied deregulation accompanied these changes, as nations competed to attract businesses that were suddenly free to locate themselves anywhere resources, labor, and environmental costs were lowest .
 The free movement of capital across national borders was heralded by western pundits as the final victory of the free market over socialism and communist totalitarianism . This is the case for the first time since the Second World War .
 Boris Yeltsin handed over the Presidential Emblem to Vladimir Putin in Russia . The former President was suddenly in position to buy up state-owned assets the government was selling .
 Vladimir Putin’s administration began in 1999 when Putin became Prime Minister while Yeltsin was still president . These opportunities were especially lucrative during Putin's administration, which began when he was PM .
 Putin's friends and allies did extremely well in the sell-off of Soviet state industries . Putin’s friends and . allies did . extremely well . in the sale-off . of state industries, Putin's allies did well in selling off state industries.
 With the spike in oil prices in the early 2000s these men made vast fortunes . They became some of the billionaire oligarchs we now see running the Russian economy for their own benefit .
 The change to capitalism in Russia did much less than it might have to benefit the general population because the oligarchs captured so much of the profit . The change in capitalism did little to help the Russian people, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The man who captured the most profit seems to have been Vladimir Putin himself . Putin captured most profit from the sale of his assets .
 Putin’s net worth in 2018 was estimated around $200 billion, or about twice the wealth of Jeff Bezos and four times that of Bill Gates, the two men who then topped the Forbes list of the world's richest people . Putin's net worth is estimated around twice that of
 One of the important forces driving globalization has been the removal of protectionist trade policies around the world . Trade policies have been removed from protectionist policies in recent years .
 GATT reduced average tariff levels between member nations from 22% in 1947 to just 5% in 1999 . Over time, average tariffs were reduced to 5% between member countries .
 The World Trade Organization that followed GATT is a more permanent agreement that covers trade in services and intellectual property as well as physical products . GATT was created by GATT in 1903 .
 Critics argue the WTO favors rich nations over poor nations . Critics argue it favors rich countries over poor countries . The WTO’s charter calls on it to “ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible”
 Global corporations that can deploy teams of lawyers (or even station them permanently in Geneva) to argue in their interest seem to have a disproportionate influence on WTO decisions . Corporations that can use lawyers to argue for their interests appear to have disproportionate influence .
 Most of these rulings have benefitted the transnational corporations, often at the expense of workers, consumers, and the environment . Most of the rulings have been done at the behest of transnational companies, writes John Defterios .
 Transnational corporations are uniquely suited to take advantage of this new world economy . Transnational corporation is uniquely suited for taking advantage of the world economy. Transnational companies will be able to compete in the global marketplace.
 The next five on the list are Saudi Aramco, Volkswagen, BP, Amazon, and Toyota . The next 5 are Saudi Arabia Aramco and Volkswagen .
 Placement on this list is based on revenues, which is similar to the GDP used to measure the size of national economies . Placement is based based on revenue, similar to that of the GDP .
 Free trade and “laisseissez faire” capitalism are typically believed to be a conservative value . Some people have been surprised to see the recent Republican administration opposing agreements like NAFTA and TPP .
 Globalist trade policies have often been called “neoliberal,” but this is another confusing term . The globalist trade policy is often called ‘neoliberal’ and this is a confusing term for the globalist .
 The elements that make this ideology ‘Neo’ are in many ways the opposite of liberalism, says Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: "Neo" is the antithesis of liberalism .
 Since the Enlightenment in social and political thinking that preceded the American Revolution, “liberal” has referred to a focus on expanding the rights and liberties of regular people, often against the power of governments .
 Today the liberties being protected by neoliberalism are often those of corporations . corporations have gained so much power over the lives of regular people that they are a more immediate threat than governments .
 NAFTA was an example of neoliberal policy that increased the liberty of corporations at the expense of people . NAFTA was a model of neoliberal policies that increased corporations' liberty, people's liberty .
 Perot went on to explain that although in the long run and from a global perspective, globalization makes economic sense, it was not necessarily good for America . Perot: "I'm not sure if globalization is good for the U.S. but it's bad for America's economy
 He said,’when jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to . six dollars per hour, he said . Then it’s leveled again. He said .
 Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported the North American Free Trade Agreement . The agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994 . Perot was defeated in the 1994 election .
 Mexico has become a large consumer of U.S. corn which receives extensive subsidies from the United States government . Mexico has also become a major consumer of United States corn . The United States has also received extensive subsidies for corn production .
 Cheap American corn has impacted the ability of Mexican farmers to compete . It has also impacted the biodiversity of maize, which you'll remember was originally developed in Mexico . Cheap U.S. corn has negatively impacted the diversity of maize .
 Indigenous varieties are threatened by the monoculture of U.S.-developed hybrids . Since corn is wind-pollenated, the indigenous varieties are in actual danger of being lost .
 A pest or disease that wiped out Monsanto’s GMO corn would be bad for the company, but it would become a global disaster if scientists had no other varieties they could use to produce a new, resistant hybrid .
 Experts and pundits all agreed that NAFTA was not to blame, and for the most part, the press ignored or misrepresented the Mexican financial crisis . The Tequila Crisis was nicknamed the Tequila crisis, which it nicknamed .
 Mexican factories called maquialadoras were located just south of the border and made products for the United States market .
 In the five years after NAFTA’s 1994 implementation, maquila employment nearly doubled . Maquila employment in Mexico nearly doubled in five years .
 Factories in border towns adjacent to the United States manufacture goods using supplies shipped to them duty-free . They then ship them back to the U.S. using the supplies they have been shipped in .
 By 2004, maquiladoras accounted for 54% of Mexico’s exports to the U.S., and United States exports had grown to 90% of the total exports to Mexico .
 The advantages for U.S. manufacturers were lower wages than the United States (in 2015 the Mexican hourly wage averaged $0.55) and fewer environmental and worker safety regulations .
 As low as the pay is, after the Mexican recession of the 1990s these jobs sometimes pay better than other available work for poor Mexicans . After the recession of 1990s, after . Mexico's recession, these jobs often pay better .
 The gains in Mexican employment have been matched by losses in the U.S. As Perot had predicted, until wages for factory workers in Mexico rise substantially, workers in the United States will not be able to compete .
 There are still over 3,000 maquiladoras along the US-Mexican border . Despite the U.S. recession in the early 2000s and competition from other even lower-wage areas like Asia, there are still more than a million maquils .
 TPP was established in 2016 to create a common market for countries bordering the Pacific . It was established by the Asian Economic Development Agency in 2007 .
 It sought to eliminate tariff and regulatory barriers to trade between most of the nations on the Pacific rim . The Pacific rim sought to create a common market between Asia and the west coasts of North and South America .
 TPP would establish Investor-state dispute system that would allow global corporations to sue countries for practices they deem to be discriminatory . TPP would also establish an Investor-State dispute system .
 Critics argue this raises the status of corporations to make them equal or even superior to sovereign nations . Critics say it would favor their interests over the rights of citizens passing laws to safeguard workers' rights, the environment, or other local concerns .
 This is another way neoliberal policies subvert the democratic institutions created by the original liberalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Neoliberal policies are another way to subvert democratic institutions, says Julian Zelizer .
 NAFTA already includes an investor-state court system for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico . Since most of the companies that would use this system are American-based, it is not seen as an issue for Americans .
 TPP would be a much bigger source of lawsuits from transnational corporations not originally based in America . The U.S. has higher minimum wages, worker safety standards, and environmental regulations, would probably be a target .
 The support shown by “centrists” of both political parties in the U.S. suggests a growing sense among regular people that both parties are under the control of their political donors . The opposition of populists on the left and right wings of both parties suggests that they are
 An important element of the shift away from a U.S.-centered globalization is the growing economic power of Asia . Asia's economic power is a key factor in the shift from the United States to Asia's .
 Japan’s economy was jump-started after WWII by United States aid . U.S. aid included a $2 billion direct investment and letting Japan off the hook for war reparations . Japan's economy was jumped-started by the United States .
 The Japanese economy focused on low-wage industries producing products for export to America . Japanese goods were also given preferential access to U.S. consumer markets .
 The United States no longer considered Japan a threat, but rather as a potential ally against communist China . The U.S. no longer considers Japan as a threat but as potential ally in China .
 Other Asian nations like Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan followed in Japan’s footsteps in the 1960s and 70s . The U.S. helped slow the spread of communism during the Cold War .
 Deng devaluation of the nation’s currency allowed Chinese savings and foreign exchange surpluses to be invested in securities like U.S. government bonds . China had a plentiful supply of cheap labor, and high savings rates .
 This made China the world’s bank, as nations like the U.S. fell deeper into debt . China is now the world's bank, while the United States is in debt .
 A rising standard of living in China has created a new middle class and a huge consumer market . China's rising standards of living have created a growing middle class .
 In 2002, ninety percent of the Chinese population lived in poverty, with seven percent listed as middle class, two percent upper-middle class, and one percent considered affluent by world standards .
 By 2012, the number of poor in China has been reduced to twenty-nine percent . The number of people in China is now at least 29 percent .
 Two thirds of the poor (nearly a billion people) have improved standards of living, in one of the most momentous shifts in world history . Nearly a billion of them have improved their living standards in the past decade .
 Fifty-four percent of Chinese in 2012 were considered middle class . That figure is expected to rise to upper-middle class status by 2022 . Another twenty-two percent is moving from poverty into the middle class, leaving only 16 percent of people in poverty .
 China is becoming a dominant force in the world economy once again . The increased spending power of the Chinese people will soon drive the global market . China's spending power will soon be a major factor in the global economy .
 Chinese demand is expected to outpace the rest of the world for the foreseeable future . Chinese demand for items like automobiles expected to continue to grow .
 Foxconn began as a contract manufacturer of low-tech items like computer cases . It has now become a nearly $5 billion manufacturer of the highest tech items like Apple iPhones and computers .
 Lenovo, which began as a Hong Kong PC clone company in 1984, has been the world’s largest personal computer maker since 2018 .
 Lenovo acquired IBM’s PC division in 2005, and the famous IBM ThinkPad became a Chinese product . Lenovo acquired the famous ThinkPad from IBM in 2005 .
 Lenovo was the world’s largest cell-phone maker until 2016 when it was overtaken by Apple and Samsung . Lenovo does about $45 billion in annual revenue and was the largest cell phone maker .
 As Chinese purchasing power increases, world industry will be challenged with producing consumer goods without exhausting finite resources or destroying the environment . World industry is challenged with making consumer goods with less energy .
 Chinese cities have been known for their pollution, especially for their poor air quality . China's air quality is notoriously poor and poor .
 An increasingly affluent population may become less willing to tolerate environmental destruction, which might be a positive change . It's possible that an affluent population will be less likely to tolerate destruction .
 The European Union grew out of a 1957 trade agreement that expanded on GATT to form the European Economic Community . France, Belgium, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were the members of the community .
 In 19938, the European Union was formed including the original EEC members as well as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom .
 16 member nations adopted a single currency, the Euro, in 1999 . Sweden and the UK retained the Krone and the Pound Sterling . The Euro was adopted by 16 countries in 1999, although Sweden and UK retained Krone .
 The English financial district called the City of London has always been a center of European banking and finance . The British were desperate to protect Growth of the European Economic Community/European Union .
 In the early 2000s several Eastern European nations joined, bringing membership up to 28 nations . The U.S. is one of the world's largest economies .
 Eurozone established emergency loan procedures that allowed richer members to bail out the economies of poorer members in exchange for economic reforms . Most of these new members adopted the Euro as well, and after the global financial crisis of 2007-8, the Eurozone was established emergency loans to poorer members .
 Borrowers often viewed reforms as a takeover of their economies and harsh austerity programs . Borrower often viewed these reforms as taking over their economies . The reforms were often seen as harsh austerity measures .
 In June 2016 the United Kingdom held a referendum and in a shocking nationalist vote the majority decided to leave the European Union . The referendum was held in June 2016 and the majority voted to leave .
 The Republic of Ireland will remain an EU member, which will complicate the situation on the border between Ireland and British Northern Ireland . Northern Ireland will be part of the EU, but the Republic will remain part of Ireland .
 EU nations seem disinclined to allow Britain to retain the favored trade status it currently enjoys . The economic impact on Britain is difficult to calculate, but EU nations appear to be wary of the move .
 Many British people and politicians wished to reverse the decision to leave the EU . But the EU was unwilling to pretend the decision never happened . And although many British people wanted to reverse it, the EU did not want to .
 During 2020, an eleven-month transition period was agreed upon, to allow negotiators to establish post-Brexit policies . The transition period is expected to begin in 2020 .
 At the end of 2020, an agreement seems to have been reached that will allow the UK and the EU to continue trading without tariffs in 2021 . The UK and EU will be able to continue to trade without tariffs without tariffs starting in 2021.
 Global culture has been permanently changed by communications technology . In addition to the increase in international trade, global culture has also been changed by technology .
 Computer networks and cell phones continued a process begun with the printing press, the telegraph, radio, and television . Cell phones are the latest in a long line of technological innovations .
 Each of these technologies has been used to spread ideas to wider audiences, often against the wishes of those in power . Each technology has spread ideas across the world, often in defiance of government wishes .
 Smart phones and social networks have been used to spread news of events like Tiananmen Square protests, the Arab Spring and the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 .
 In spite of efforts of some nations like China and Saudi Arabia to censor media and limit internet access, it is increasingly difficult to firewall societies from the global media culture . The world's media culture is becoming more and more permeable .
 One of the first computer networks was the semi-automatic business research environment launched by IBM in 1960 . IBM initially connected two mainframe systems and grew into an airline reservation system . IBM launched the network in 1960, connecting two mainframes .
 ARPANET, begun in 1969, was a network of networks dedicated to official communications . It joined government facilities and research universities on a system dedicated to the official communications system .
 Commercial and political communications, however, were strictly forbidden . Commercial, political communications were also forbidden .
 Ted Nelson developed the basic ideas that became hypertext and the web between 1965 and 1972 . Nelson was a computer scientist named Ted Nelson who developed the idea of hypertext .
 Nelson’s version of hypertext was based on the idea that there would be a “master” record of any document on the network . Nelson's idea was that there should be a master’ record of all documents in the network.
 Nelson called transclusions in his 1980 book, Literary Machines, in which he called them transclusions . Exact copies of that document would point back to Nelson's original .
 Ideally, rather than just referring to the original, they would actually call up the original document wherever possible, eliminating the proliferation of copies .
 This ideal was never really achieved, because even though storage was expensive, bandwidth was even scarcer . Storage was expensive and bandwidth was scarcer, even though it was even more expensive .
 The existence of bi-directional links would have allowed the owner of a document to know where and when it was used, and to have received compensation for its use . This is unfortunate, because the owner would have been able to receive compensation for their use .
 Twoway linkage was much more difficult to implement than a oneway hyperlink that launched the user to a new place on the web . Twoway linking was more difficult than a linking hyperlink .
 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak compared the two in a speech about Nelson in the 1990s . He said one-way linking was a cool hack, while two-way links required computer science . Woznniak: "One way linking was cool hack"
 AOL free trial CDs became ubiquitous . CEO Steve Case claimed that at one point in the 90s half the CDs produced worldwide had a AOL logo . AOL CEO said at one time in the 1990s half a million CDs had a logo .
 The commercial nature of subscriptions like AOL stood in sharp contrast, for a while, to the early internet . AOL was the first internet subscription service to offer a subscription service .
 Somebody jotted on the front page of the paper, “Vague but exciting” Tim was given time to work out the details on a NeXT computer in his lab .
 Andreessen graduated, moved to California and met Jim Clark, who had recently left Silicon Graphics . Andreessen moved to Silicon Valley and met Clark at the start of his career .
 Netscape made their browser, Navigator, available for free to non-commercial users . Netscape was formed by Netscape and Netscape in 1995 .
 Netscape Navigator was destroyed by Microsoft’s decision to bundle its own browser, Internet Explorer, with Windows 95 . Internet Explorer was Microsoft's own browser .
 Microsoft made it very difficult for PC manufacturers or users to uninstall IE and use Netscape and Java . The court ruled that Microsoft had abused its monopoly powers in 2001 .
 Netscape never recovered from losing the "first browser war" and was acquired by AOL in 1999 .
 Windows app provided a WSIWYG design interface and output usable HTML code . It was a Windows app that provided a design interface . The app was created for the Windows app .
 Frontpage was not replaced by anything with similar power and ease of use . Discontinued in 20038, Frontpage did not replace anything similar to Frontpage . Frontpage has been used for more than 100 years .
 In 1999, Web 2. was announced, which claimed to focus on participation by users rather than people simply viewing content passively . Web 2 is a new generation of the web that focuses on participation rather than passively viewing content .
 One example of this participatory nature of the new web is the proliferation of social media . Social media is an example of how participatory social media is becoming more and more .
 The actual number of sites in active use is probably closer to 200,000, it is estimated .
 People could create a profile page, post images and multimedia, and see what their friends were up to . People could use the site to see what they are up to, including photos and multimedia .
 It was much less structured than what we’re used to today, allowing users a lot of flexibility to personalize their pages . We’ve been using the site for more than a decade .
 Myspace was overtaken by a service, Facebook, that provided even more ease of use and uniformity . Facebook was Facebook's most popular social networking site .
 Facebook is extremely easy to use, which may be why it has recently become the place for grandparents to stalk millennials . Facebook is a great place to stalk your friends and family .
 Most of the hardware and software you use is developed during your lifetime . Most of it was developed during the development of your own computer .
 The final element in the story of computing and networks involves the battle between free, open resources and commerce, which we’ve already seen in the growth of the web . The battle between commerce and free resources has already been seen in web .
 Other organizations released versions which only ran on their hardware . IBM, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, SGI — all roprietary distributions with similar unctionality .
 He wrote an operating system kernel in , C, which he planned on calling Freax . He planned to call it Freax.
 The open-source operating system rapidly gained popularity among hackers due to its free distribution and its easy configurability . The operating system is free and easy to download and install .
 A programmer could configure the Linux kernel with just the features desired, which led to an explosion of both OS distributions as well as uses in embedded systems which were becoming popular .
 Networked off-the-shelf PCs running Linux could rival the computing power of proprietary supercomputers . NASA discovered that clusters of networked networked PCs could rival supercomputing .
 Companies like Sun and SGI found the markets for their workstations and servers disappearing overnight .
 The #2 machine was the world’s fastest supercomputer from 2018 to 2016 . It uses Intel Xeon CPUs . The machine is based on Intel's Intel processors .
 The U.S. government banned the sale of processors to China in 2015 . The processors are used to process food from China .
 The official reason for the ban was national security concerns . Many suspected a desire to recover the status as the world’s fastest computer for America may have been a strong motivation as well .
 China responded by shifting to using its own Sunway CPUs, based on a new architecture and instruction set completed in 2016 . The Sunway CPU architecture is based on the new instruction set .
 As computing power enables increasingly complex artificial intelligence systems that can control financial trading systems, power grids, and scientific research, the challenges of national technology competitions become apparent .
 Social media has been implicated in helping cause the genocide in Myanmar against the minority Rohinga population . Social media is implicated in the genocide against Myanmar's minority population .
 Cambridge Analytica may have influenced the 2016 Brexit vote . Facebook data may have been manipulated by the company to influence the 2016 vote .
 Foreign hacking and social media manipulation were both alleged during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential election . It's unclear whether the intervention changed the outcome .
 Details have come to light of just how compromised social media sites like Facebook have become and how much of their users’ data they hold . In the course of investigating charges of Russian interference, Facebook has been compromised .
 Edward Snowden released information to journalists showing that intelligence agencies such as the NSA and British GCHQ are systematically invading the privacy of citizens .
 As a result of these disclosures, Snowden has been forced to live in exile in Russia . Snowden is a former NSA contractor .
 It is not clear, however, whether the practices have been discontinued .
 Social Media algorithms create ‘filter bubbles’ in which people only see information that doesn’t threaten their world-views . Even when there’s not an adversary regime like Russia spreading disinformation, Social Media .
 Social media platforms and search engines routinely direct users to information that will attract and hold their attention for the longest time possible . In an attempt to generate greater advertising revenues, social media platforms are often directed users to the wrong information .
 Users are directed to information that conforms to their ‘profile’ of beliefs and biases . However, as a result of this, users will be directed to the information they want to see . This information is based on their “profile” of beliefs .
 News and information tailored to conform to audiences’ beliefs and prejudices, or to outrage, is tailored to fit them with the world’s prejudices or outrage, or not .
 As time goes on, people on different sides of issues can find themselves living in different worlds, basing their beliefs on different data, and believing the other side is irrational and evil . People on both sides of the issues can literally find themselves .
 In the early days of the internet, communication was text-based because bandwidths were low . Communication was text based because of the lack of internet bandwidth .
 G.G and 5G cellular networks allow media to be streamed to smartphones and tablets . The advent of fiber optic network backbones in the 1990s created the opportunity to communicate using images and ultimately streaming video .
 This rapidly expanding bandwidth created an opportunity for the internet to replace broadcast television just as it had replaced the analog, landline telephone network . The internet is now replacing broadcast television as well as the landline network .
 The Federal Communications Commission has begun to eliminate net neutrality so corporations can buy “fast-lane” access to the web . On the other hand, more content is produced for the web by global corporations daily .
 The promise of the early internet was that even though corporations participated, it was basically a peerto-peer platform . The promise was that the internet would be basically a peer-to-peer system .
 Eliminating net neutrality could potentially kill that, unless hackers come up with a new disruptive technology that allows the people to stay ahead of the corporations .
 Imagine if a group with deep pockets and a political agenda could start editing what you can see on the internet . Imagine a group of deep pockets could edit the content of what you see online .
 The impact of population growth and resource scarcity has come to the attention of historians and more recently the public . One of the most basic but often overlooked aspects of human interactions with the environment .
 Society prefers to avoid thinking about the danger of having too many humans around . There are a number of reasons society prefers not to think about the dangers .
 "Historically, the growth of our own particular group has been important for our survival and therefore has been desirable. And historically, we have been able to grow our own group," she said .
 In the past, people haven't always been too concerned if the success of their particular community came at the expense of their neighbors . But now, people are concerned that their neighbors are at risk of losing them .
 In times of scarcity, attention focuses on how a shrinking or too-small pie is divided up . The scarcity of the pie is a key factor in how society deals with scarcity .
 Since the industrial revolution, Westerners have been able to live outside of the constrictions of zero sum logic . Westerners are able to afford to live without the constraints of zero sums logic . This is not the case in the U.S.
 To a great extent, this Thomas Robert Malthus, one of the first abundance and sense that the popes toconcem sane pie was growing was based on the increase in staple foods made available throughout the world by the Columbian Exchange and Green Revolution .
 Thomas Robert Malthus published a short book called An Essay on the Principle of Population . The book was published in the very beginning of the modern age .
 Malthus’s theory, published in 1798, became instantly controversial on both sides of the Atlantic . The theory was published on the basis of his theory of population overpopulation .
 Thomas Jefferson sent a copy of the book to his favorite economist and asked for an opinion . Thomas Jefferson asked for the opinion of the economist . Jefferson sent the book back to Jefferson .
 Population grows as long as there is food and water to support it, and when these resources run out, population is brought back down through famine, disease, and war . Another way of saying that is, population grows when there is not enough food or water for it to support .
 Early modern Europeans were obsessed with acquiring new territories to improve their food production abilities . By this logic it is easy to see that a society can easily outrun its ability to feed itself .
 The famines, diseases, and wars of European history gave Malthus the examples he needed of the types of crises that tended to reduce populations . The famine, disease and wars were examples of the type of crises he needed .
 If society was going to avoid these periodic disasters, he argued, then it would need to find some way of limiting birthrate to avoid starving .
 The Malthusian theory, as it is called, was intensely controversial right from the start . The theory is based on the theory of population growth .
 Malthus called for what he termed ‘moral restraint’ to help reduce the birth rate . Many Malthuians had more active contraceptive measures in mind . The birth rate was much higher than the birth control goal .
 Global deaths in conflicts since the year 1400 @ Each 00)] sents one conflict. ee Global deaths have not left these arguments behind . ee .
 Malthusian thought was used by some members of the British upper classes to argue that the conditions of the poor should not be improved . The other big controversy was that some of the upper classes argued that improving conditions should not improve .
 If poor people had higher wages and more to eat, they would have more children and more of their children would survive, they argued . This would put unnecessary stress on the social system and in the long run lead to mass starvation .
 Some critics accused the Malthusians of simply wanting to hoard more of everything for themselves . Some critics accuse them of simply trying to hoard even more .
 Some say adding more hungry mouths isn't good for the poor or the rich . But some sincerely believed that there just wasn’t enough to go around .
 Malthus thought feeding the poor would lead to an explosion in population . The assumption held by the British upper class is actually untrue, he says .
 Population scientists agree that as economic security increases, a “demographic shift’s” occurs and birth rates decline . Population scientists today agree, after studying societies all over the world, that as economies increase, birth rates drop .
 Death rates of children decline and as a result parents need to insure that someone will survive to take care of them in their old age have fewer children . Parents need to ensure that someone survives in old age, they have fewer kids .
 Educating women is the other major factor demographers have credited with reducing birthrates . Demographers have also credited women's education as a major factor in reducing birthrate rates .
 Family sizes have decreased from an average of six children per family in the early nineteenth century to 1.1 in the twentieth century . Both factors contributed to a demographic shift in the developed world .
 Many developed nations now face decreased growth or even shrinkage in their native populations . Developed nations face decreasing growth or shrinkage of their native population .
 “Save the People or Save the Planet” is still very poorly understood, according to the author of the book . The book is titled, "Save the Planet," and claims that the issue is still poorly understood .
 Gates compared two nations, Afghanistan and Thailand, which currently have populations of similar size . Gates compared the size of each country to the population of Thailand .
 In Afghanistan, 10% of children die before the age of five, population is expected to nearly double by 2050 . Population in Afghanistan expected to rise by more than 10% in 2050 .
 In Thailand, the number of children dying has decreased substantially . Thailand has seen a decrease in children dying in the past few years .
 As we have already seen, this has not been the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As well as the past, this is not the case of the eighteenth and twentyth century. This is not a case for the first time, it is a matter of history. As we
 New staple crops from the Americas, abundant land, fertilizers, and technology created a global Green Revolution that has allowed us to continually outrun Malthus for the last two centuries . We have been outrunning Malthu for the past two centuries.
 Karl Sprengel noticed in 1828 that plant growth was limited by the availability of the essential nutrient with the lowest concentration . Plant growth limited by availability of nutrient with lowest concentration, he says .
 Sprengel's contemporary, biologist Justus von Liebig, popularized it as Liebig’s Law, which became a key idea in ecology . Liebig's Law is now a key part of ecology .
 The Law states that growth is dictated not by the total resources available, but by the scarcest resource, which he called the limiting factor . Growth is dictated by the amount of resources available and the amount that is available .
 Until very recently in human history, the Earth has been so big and the total human population relatively so small, that the resources available to us have often seemed infinite . The Earth is so big that it has often seemed like infinite, but resources have often been available to humans .
 During this dramatic increase, there were periods like the early industrial revolution when worriers like Malthus and his followers expressed doubts and anxiety . During this period of industrial revolution, there was a period of anxiety, anxiety .
 Malthus had no idea that his nation was about to expand its empire into Africa and Asia . Emigration to the Americas and Australia would continue to reduce populations at home .
 He couldn't anticipate advances in technology or the demographic effects of increasing economic security we have just considered . And of course, he couldn’t anticipate advances .

 The population of Ireland boomed in the first decades of the nineteenth century, as potatoes increased the calories available to poor people and seemed to eliminate the threat of famine . Ireland's population boomed as potatoes were the main source of food for poor .
 The Irish population peaked at over 8 million in 1841, based on the potato . The population of Ireland peaked at 8 million based on potato production .
 Third of all Irish people ate no other solid food, and lived on a diet of milk and potatoes . About a third of Irish people lived on milk and potato .
 The entire nation grew just a single variety of potato, called the Irish Lumper . The potato was called the 'Irish Lumper' The Irish potato was the only variety grown in Ireland .
 As the science of ecology developed in the second half of the twentieth century, we began to distinguish between renewable and nonrenewable resources . We began to worry about the dangers of depending on monoculture food supplies .
 A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text . Malthusian anxiety has returned .
 It began with the statement, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.” It was written in a statement that the battle was over .
 In the 1970s, hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now . The 1970s was the worst year of starvation in the United States . In the 1980s, millions of Americans were starving in the U.S.
 Ehrlich’s scenarios inspired some great dystopian science fiction, but luckily they did not happen in the way they had predicted . The scenarios inspired great sci-fi fiction .
 A couple hundred million people did die of hunger in the decades after The Population Bomb was published . The population bomb was published in 1970s .
 When the United Nations reported worldwide deaths in the 1970s and 80s, it specifically omitted deaths from hunger . It's hard to tell exactly because when the U.N. reported deaths, it omitted hunger deaths .
 Ehrlich had predicted social chaos in the world . But the deaths did not reduce world population overall or result in social chaos, he says .
 The Population Bomb may have done more harm than good in the long run, by making worry over the population issue an easy target for critics . The population bomb may have made it easier for critics to target the population .
 People remained concerned about the rapid increase of the world’s human population . But people remained concerned that the rapid rise of the population was not behind it .
 In 1972 an international organization called The Club of Rome published a study titled The Limits to Growth . In 1972, an international group published The Limits To Growth .
 In 2008, the original authors of The Limits to Growth returned to their models and published a 30-year review of how accurate their predictions had been . The original authors have published a review of their predictions .
 Measurements of all the variables tracked with the predictions the computer models had made for an “overshoot and collapse” scenario . They found that measurements of all those variables were tracking with predictions the models made .
 The accuracy of the predictions the study had made for the short term does not prove their longerterm predictions were accurate, of course .
 Marion King Hubbert was an American geophysicist working for Shell Oil in 1956 . He presented a research paper to an oil industry trade group The American Petroleum Institute . He showed that for any geographical area petroleum production follows a predictable bell-shaped curve .
 Several credible sources suggest that the peak in world production happened between 2008 and 2004, right on Hubbert’s schedule . The data and especially its interpretation are very controversial .
 These new additions do not refute the logic of Hubbert’s predictions, although they do potentially push back the timing of the supply crunch that we would expect to raise prices .
 The Limits to Growth’s computer mode, industrial production and food supplies, depend heavily on the price of energy . A third is an issue for both fracking and tar sands processing .
 A reduction of the supply of oil, an increase in its cost, or increase in pollution could all have a significant negative impact on those variables . A reduction in oil supply, a decrease in the cost of oil and pollution could have a negative impact .
 During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth . In parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential growth culture . We have evolved a culture of exponential growth that has led to exponential growth in the past .
 These are not the words of some dewy-eyed environmentalist or crazy academic or sensationalist, they say . These are the words from some of the world's leading environmentalists .
 Some argue that future discoveries of more oil could postpone society’s shift to a non-fossil fuel energy economy . Some have argued that possible future discoveries could postpone the shift .
 Even the oil industry agrees that production will decline . But even the most part of the industry agrees production will continue to decline . The U.S. oil industry has a long history of declining production .
 Climate activists suggest switch from fossil fuels to other energy sources as soon as possible . Some say that for the sake of the environment, we ought to switch to other sources .
 Fossil fuels are one of the biggest contributors of atmospheric carbon that leads to global warming . The argument against burning the rest of the oil is that fossil fuels contribute to atmospheric carbon .
 Other factors such as deforestation and even agribusiness release comparable amounts of carbon . While this is true, it is true that other factors release carbon .
 Simply stopping the use of oil will not solve the whole climate change problem, but it is a key element of the change society needs to make to stabilize the global climate . Simply stopping using oil won't solve the problem, although it is key to stabilizing the climate, experts say .
 Global energy corporations have incredible ability to influence politics . Global energy companies have an incredible influence on politics, says David Cameron .
 BP issued an “Energy Outlook’s report for the year 2035 . BP was established in 1908 as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and now operating in 72 countries .
 BP announced the company’s intention to burn just as much as possible over the next two decades . BP claimed that Hubbert’�s Peak Oil scenario was actually incorrect and announced that it would burn as much of as possible .
 BP’s claim that oil production hasn’t peaked, however, depended on redefining the word oil to include tar sands and biofuels such as ethanol . BP: "Oil production hasn't peaked, but it's not peaked"
 Ethanol production depends on the energyintensive production of surplus corn and cane sugar . Government subsidies keep the prices of these commodities below their cost of production . Brazil's ethanol production depends heavily on government subsidies .
 The idea that the planet’s climate has been adversely affected by human activity is very controversial in the media, politics, and popular culture . But scientists say it is almost universally accepted by scientists . The idea of human activity affecting the planet's climate is controversial .
 Per capita carbon emissions by country . Bahr 2 Middle East 8 anno O22 25-Oct-2020 by Thomas Schule .
 The penalties for heeding their warnings are really hard to specify . Of course who they mean by “we” is unclear, and the penalties for ignoring them are hard to say .
 We often hear that “The forecasts show that it is China, India, and the other emerging economies that are increasing their carbon dioxide emissions at a speed that will cause dangerous climate change.” “China, India and other emerging countries that are . increasing their . carbon dioxide
 European Union environment minster said the proposal was a 'no-brainer' at Davos in 2007 . The EU environment minister was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos at the time .
 It is unacceptable for Europe and America to try to shift the blame when we still outproduce them on a per capita basis . While it’s important for China and India to get their carbon emissions under control, it is unacceptable to blame Europe .
 Most of the carbon now in the atmosphere was put there by us. Especially since most of it was put by us . Most of it is in the air .
 Most Americans distrusts science and scientists, because science seems to contradict their most cherished religious doctrines . And to make matters worse, most Americans share a belief system that distrusts scientists and scientists .
 Concern over climate change has been identified with a particular political orientation, with people like former Vice President Al Gore seeming to suggest that if people aren't alarmed by climate change, they’re monsters who don’t love their children .
 The claim that only liberals care about the environment is not only absurd, but it ignores the traditional meaning of the word conservative . The claim is absurd .
 The argument against recognizing climate change and doing something about it has also been carefully managed and funded by political action committees and foundations representing corporations that oppose changes in fossil fuel energy policy .
 Less than half of Americans are aware that scientists are basically unanimous on climate change . That affects their own opinions about climate change and the government policies they support to mitigate it .
 A recent study found that 91 organizations received $558,000,000 in funding from 2003 to 2010 . Most of the public statements against climate change made could be traced to 91 organizations, the study found .
 From 2008 to 2007 this money was easily traceable to sources such as ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, two corporations opposed to any changes in energy policy . Koch Industries and ExxonMobil are among those opposed to changes in policy .
 The sources of money paying for climate change denial have been more difficult to trace . Citizens United Supreme Court decision allowed corporations to hide their political spending .
 Climate deniers warn of the ‘command economies’ they claim environmentalists wish to impose . They use language designed to rile up libertarians and free market enthusiasts and mobilize them against changing the economy . Although they would be very bad for big oil companies, they would almost certainly create millions
 American think tanks have also recently begun funding publishing in foreign countries to spread their message . Think tanks also recently funded publishing by American think tankers .
 Germany is becoming a world leader in solar energy deployment, in spite of receiving only as much sunlight as Alaska . Britain is mapping its shift to a post-oil based economy with its “transition The Solar Settlement, a sustainable towns . Many Americans aa Erojecs
 Most economists agree that there are currently more jobs in the renewable energy sector than in the fossil fuel sector . That trend is going to increase, and that trend is likely to increase .
 The overall economy would be better off, if we shifted to sustainable energy sources and reduced carbon emissions . The economy would benefit from shifting energy sources to reduce carbon emissions, the author says .
 Of course, the global petroleum industry would be decimated, so they’re spending their money trying to slow the transition . Of course the global . petroleum industry . would be . decimated . of course, so . they're spending their . money .
 Of nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed climate articles published between 1991 and 2012, only 24 reject global warming . Only 24 of those articles rejected global warming in the past two decades .
 There really isn’t any doubt that the Earth’s climate is changing in ways that are going to cause serious social disruption in the future . Climate change is going to be a major social disruption for the next generation .
 Political leaders say there is still doubt about the need to address climate change . We should follow the money to discover why, we should follow it to discover .
 Our unwillingness or inability to understand the situation causes us to continue being manipulated by organizations interested in maintaining the status quo . Our choices in the future will be much more limited than they need to be, says the author .
 Since the late 18th century, many republics have separated governmental responsibilities into three branches, the legislative, executive and judicial branches . Choosing a Chief Executive and Voting Three Branches of Government: Legislative, Executive and Judicial .
 The legislative branch (usually called a congress, parliament, or assembly) writes laws and appropriates funds for governmental departments and agencies . It is called the legislative branch .
 Some legislative branches have two chambers, such as the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives . Some chambers are apportioned according to each state's population . The Senate has equal representation in both chambers .
 The executive (a president or prime minister on the national level, or governor on a state level) administers and enforces the laws passed by the executive branch . The executive also generally conducts foreign policy .

 The highest court decides whether or not particular laws are “constitutional,” following the foundational law of the country . The court decides if or not certain laws are constitutional .
 Democracies choose the chief executive through either a_ presidential, parliamentary, or presidentialparliamentary system . Democratic countries choose the president through a presidential, presidential, or parliamentary system .
 The president can veto laws passed by the legislative branch, which then usually need a super-majority to pass the law “over” the presidential veto . The president also has vetoes of legislation passed by both chambers of Congress .
 This system originated in its modern form in the United States Constitution . It originated in the U.S. Constitution .
 U.S. voters do not directly choose a presidential candidate, but instead vote for “electors” who are pledged to vote for a certain candidate . Technically, in a presidential election, United States voters vote for "electors" who pledge to support a candidate .
 The least-populated states have a minimum of three electors . Minnesota and Wisconsin each have ten electors . Iowa has seven . Minnesota has ten electors; Wisconsin has ten; Minnesota has 10 .
 Because of this system, it is mathematically possible for a candidate to win the popular vote and lose the electoral college vote . Most recently, this happened in 2000 and 2016 elections .
 Because of this “divided government,” critics point out that it is difficult to legislate, while others claim it is an important check on executive power .
 Recent examples in the U.S. include most of the Clinton presidency, the last two years of George W Bush presidency, and most of Obama administration .
 In the last two years of the Trump administration, the House of Representatives had a Democratic majority . President Trump was a Republican as were most members of the Senate . Most of the House members are Democrats .
 Another potential check on executive power in the presidential system is impeachment . The legislature can decide to remove a president from office for criminal activity . Impeachment is a process of impeachment .
 In most cases, the legislative branch has only one chamber instead of two . Most of the legislative branches have one chamber, not two .
 The system originated in Great Britain and is common in many former British colonies (i.e. colonies) It is common for many former colonies to use .
 Parliamentary systems sometimes include a monarch involved in the government, but usually as a figurehead who holds only symbolic power . Parliamentary systems include monarchs involved in government but only as symbolic figures .
 The Prime Minister is usually a member of the largest party, which means that legislation is more easily passed . Parliament has the right to vote against a prime minister, which may force a new election .
 Sometimes the president plays a key role in multi-party democracies in which he asks the head of a political party to form a government, usually in coalition with other parties . The president has a role in forming a government in the United States .
 A historical example we discussed earlier was Germany’s Weimar Republic . The Weimar republic was the country's first republic of the 1920s .
 When a parliament votes against a prime minister, the president may ask some other party to form a government instead of calling for new elections . The president may call for a new government after the vote against a PM .
 There are several ways in which elections can be organized in democracies . Voting systems in Democracies can be used to organize elections in democratic countries .
 In this system, the candidate with the most votes wins, meaning they can win with a plurality rather than a majority of votes . Winner-take-all is a system that means the candidate wins with a majority .
 It's common in most elections in the United States, especially in choosing members of Congress and in choosing presidential electors . It's a common practice in the U.S.
 Winner-take-all usually results in a two-party system, as in the U.S., since voters feel that they are “wasting’ their votes if they choose a third-party candidate .
 This often results in people voting against candidates they don’t want rather than for candidates they do . People often vote against candidates that they don't want, rather than those they want .
 They reason that the candidate they actually prefer might take votes away from the ‘lesser-of-twoevils’ candidate, resulting in a government that they really do not want . They also fear that they might be taking votes from a candidate they really prefer .
 This system is only used in legislative elections . Proportional Representation is a form of proportional representation . The system is used only for legislative elections.
 In proportional representation, voters choose a party; parties are assigned their number of seats in a legislature based on the percentage of votes that the party wins . Parties are assigned seats in the legislature by the party that wins the most votes .
 In fictional case, if Republicans won 35% of the vote, the first 85 individuals on their list would win a seat in the legislature . In the fictional case described above, if the Republicans won the election, they would win 85 of their list of candidates .
 A prime minister is chosen as part of a coalition of parties if no party has a clear majority in the legislature . Combined with a parliamentary or a_ presidential system of government, a multi-party situation frequently means that a prime minister must be chosen as a member of a coalition
 Candidates in this system must win at least a simple majority of votes . If this does not happen, the top two vote-winners compete in a second election . Candidates must win a majority of the vote .
 Ranked Choice Voting is a variation of the “fifty percent plus one” system . Instant Run-Off Voting is where voters rank their first choice, then their second choice, and third choice .
 If no candidate receives more than 50% as a first choice, the next count is limited to the top two vote-getters . Secondchoice votes cast by those whose first choice lost are added to top two voters .
 This system is currently being used in the Twin Cities in elections for city council and mayor . The system is being used for elections for mayor and city council .
 Banks earn a profit by lending money at interest . When borrowers pay back what they owe, they also pay the bank a percent above the amount lent . The bank earns a profit from interest .
 Borrowers include individuals who want to purchase homes and consumer goods, and businesses which are financing their operations or investing in their own expansion . Borrowing includes both individuals .
 Banks make investments in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments to earn higher rates of return . Also, in some countries, banks make investments to earn more interest rates .
 If there is too much money in the money supply, the value of money drops, so prices actually go up . The trick to remember is that if there is a high supply and low demand of a currency, prices will rise .
 Until the early 1970s, most national currencies were “backed” by gold . The value of these currencies was denominated in metal . In other words, its “worth’s ‘worth” was not “determined” in the 1970s
 Too much money in the money supply may mean that wages chase prices, which in turn chase wages, causing an inflationary spiral . As seen in the example of hyperinflation during the Weimar Republic in Chapter 8, too much money means people lose their savings to buy basic food items
 Defining what is “normal” inflation is the challenge faced by banking systems . Defining ‘normal’ inflation, and achieving that level is a challenge, experts say .
 The Federal Reserve System was established in the U.S. in 1913 . It was established during the period of activist government known as the Progressive Era .
 Other countries already had governmentrun central banks . The U.S. experimented with this idea in the 1820s and 1880s, but had abandoned it, relying exclusively on the private banking system .
 Morgan stepped in, lent money to banks that were on the verge of collapse, and investors’ confidence in the financial system was restored . Morgan: "Investor’s confidence in financial system restored"
 After the panic, many people began thinking that maybe having the entire United States banking system dependent on a single private citizen was a bad idea, and that the U.S. should adopt the “central bank” concept from other countries .
 The Fed lends money to banks at interest, which then lends to each other and to the rest of the economy at a higher rate of interest . The Fed has a history of lending to banks and the economy .
 The interest rate banks use to lend to each other is called the prime rate . The prime rate is the rate they use to borrow money from each other .
 The interest rate is usually three percentage points above the Fed’s interest rate to the banks . It is usually 3 percentage points higher than the banks' rate .
 Banks make profits by lending money at interest to the Fed . They also have to also pay back the Fed for their loans .
 The banks that borrow from other banks establish a higher interest rate than the prime rate for loans to businesses and personal borrowers . The rates are based on interest rates for businesses, personal loans .
 The bank’s rate may fluctuate for individual borrowers based on how much confidence a bank has that they will be paid back . The bank's rate will fluctuate depending on the amount of confidence the bank has .
 This decision is based on a ‘credit rating’ which is established by private companies like Standard and Poor’s and Moody's . This decision was based on the decision by the government .
 Banks also consider other factors, for both individuals and businesses, such as savings and other investments, before lending money .
 If a bank or other lending institution has less confidence in a borrower, they will charge a higher interest rate . If a lender is less confident in a loanee, it will charge higher interest rates .
 The Federal Reserve plays an important role in determining interest rates . The Fed’s Interest Rate and Monetary Policy are important factors in determining rates .
 It uses this power to establish a healthy rate of inflation or to help stimulate the economy . It also has the power to set a healthy inflation rate .
 If the Fed’s rate goes up, the prime rate will go up and banks, businesses, and consumers borrow less and buy less because borrowing gets too expensive . The Fed's rate is expected to go up in the coming months .
 High interest rates may also slow down the economy because businesses will invest less and consumers will not buy as much . However, high interest rates could also slow the economy as businesses will not invest less .
 If the interest rate goes down, banks, businesses, and consumers borrow more and buy more . The interest rate is expected to go down in the coming months .
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when there was a recession with over 10% inflation and high unemployment, the Fed raised interest rates and the prime rate went up to control inflation .

 In the U.S., the recovery was gradual but sustained . Jobs were added to the economy for every month from mid-2009 until the beginning of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic .
 The Fed buys bank debt, what banks borrow from the Fed or other banks, so that banks can lend money instead of using it to pay off their own debts . This means that the Fed buys the debt, which banks borrow, to help them lend money .
 Unlike other central banks, the Fed does not make investments . No “Sovereign Funds” like those of China and Japan .
 Central banks maintain “sovereign funds” by buying investments in their own countries, or in others . In the case of China and Japan and other countries, such countries, central banks maintain "sovereigned funds"
 Taxes pay for government services (military, police, prisons, education, infrastructure, Social Security, etc.) There are several different kinds of taxes .

 Customs and tariffs are still around but are a lot less important than they were in the nineteenth century as a source of revenue . Customs are still important but are less important now than in the late 1800s .
 Most, but not all, states also have taxes on personal income and corporate earnings . Most of the states have personal income taxes .
 Municipal governments in the U.S. usually collect property taxes to raise revenue . Municipal governments are usually collecting property taxes in the United States .
 Property taxes are based on the value of real estate held by an individual or corporation . Property taxes in the U.S. range from $100,000 to $150,000 per year .
 School taxes in the United States are almost always property taxes . Wealthy suburban districts can provide better public schools than poor urban and rural districts . Property taxes are also almost always a property tax .
 Advocates of this perspective argue that government projects and services help build the country’s future (infrastructure, education, affordable housing, etc. etc.) while providing jobs, especially during hard economic times . Advocates say government projects, services, such as infrastructure, education and affordable
 Those who promote this theory believe that individuals and businesses should have more money to spend any way they wish . The theory is that people should be able to spend their money on their own .
 Consumers will stimulate the market through personal spending, while businesses will reinvest and help grow the economy . Consumers will spend more on the economy through personal and business spending, the government says .
 This will create more government revenue as new workers and growing businesses pay taxes . New workers will be paying taxes, according to President Obama .
 Governments all over the world borrow money by selling bonds to finance spending on projects and services . Governments at every level borrow money to finance projects, services and infrastructure .
 Bondholders are paid interest on bonds, but, like stocks, may also resell them to other investors . Bondholders can be paid interest, but can resell bonds to others in the market . Bond holders are paid an interest rate of up to 10 per cent .
 Government bonds paid with revenue gradually over years, spreading the debt to the next generations . Government bonds are paid with . revenue gradually . over years .
 Others, particularly among Republicans, feel that the government should not burden future generations with more government debt . Others, including Republicans, say that debt should not be passed on to future generations .
 Economists and politicians debate about how much government debt is too much . Economists also debate about the best rate of inflation, the proper prime rate for an economy, and the level of taxation .
 An important consideration for investors interested in buying government bonds is the confidence in a government’s ability to pay its debt . Confidence in government debt is an important consideration in government bonds .
 As long as a government continues to pay its debt completely and on time, banks will lend more money to the government . Banks will adjust the interest rate based on their level of confidence . Just like individuals and businesses, as long as individuals pay their debts on time .
 Even countries have credit scores from rating agencies to help lenders and investors make decisions . Credit scores from credit agencies are used to help make decisions about lending decisions .
 Unlike individuals, governments never completely pay off debt, but that is less important than their ability to borrow based on how well they keep up on payments . However, unlike individuals, government debt is never completely paid off .
 Germany did not finish paying all reparations from World War One until 2010, yet this fact had little effect on its economy . Germany has consistently been among the world's top three economies for decades .
 If a nation’s economy collapses or some other disaster happens, or the debt gets too big, then investors will have less confidence . A government will be unable to sell bonds and borrow money .
 Future borrowing greatly affected because of the lack of confidence by investors and lenders . The debt payments are restructured by the lenders, or reneged upon entirely, with future borrowing much affected .
 Sometimes a government built infrastructure that did not end up stimulating economic growth . Other times, they did not foresee huge changes, like a population leaving a city for the suburbs . Sometimes, government infrastructure didn't anticipate huge changes .
 corrupt politicians and administrators robbed the funds, saddling a government with debt but leaving nothing of value . Sometimes, especially in certain developing nations, corrupt politicians rob the funds . Corruption is a problem in many developing nations .
