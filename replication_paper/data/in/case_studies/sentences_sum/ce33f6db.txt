 The Armageddon Letters compiles the messages that defined and defused the crisis . Jim DiEugenio: " Armageddon Letters" compiles messages that define and defuse crisis .
 Both the film and book explored the issue of whether or not, if President Kennedy had lived, the Vietnam War would have turned into the monumental disaster it did under President Johnson .
 The book was the oral record of a two-day conference between both scholars and actual policymakers of the era,g.g. The book is the record of the conference .
 A vote was taken on the question after reviewing briefing books with the latest declassified documents .
 Half the respondents said Kennedy would not have escalated and would have withdrawn from Vietnam . Half said they would have pulled out of Vietnam .
 Thirty per cent said he would have escalated as did Johnson, according to poll . 20 percent said it was too difficult to state an answer to the question .
 "If one understands the ways of academia, this was a real success in the field," says the author of the book .
 If such a vote had been taken prior to the 1992 publication of John Newman’s milestone book, JFK and Vietnam, the likely result would have been perhaps 10 percent for a Kennedy withdrawal and 90 percent for there being no change by Johnson in Kennedy's policy . The likely result of
 The declassified records align with the vote tally of the book . And this is all to the good because the declassified record aligns with the book's vote tally .
 The married couple has taken part in a living-breathing field inquiry . They have been married for more than 20 years .
 They have pursued declassified records, and interviewed personages all over the world . They have also interviewed people in the world to find out who they are .
 They even have promoted conferences on the subject with the people who were involved in the 1962 event . The 1962 event was the first of its kind .
 Robert McNamara, Kennedy’s Secretary of Defense, attended every one of them until his death in 2009 . McNamara believed in them so much that he attended every single one of the meetings .
 At more than one of them, there have been revelations that changed the picture we had of the crisis . The revelations have been revealed at more than two of the most recent events .
 The intelligence the CIA had on the actual missiles in Cuba has been proven to be inaccurate . For instance, the intelligence the . CIA had about the missiles in . Cuba has proven to have been inaccurate .
 The Agency could not figure out exactly how many missiles had been transported through the blockade, or how many had operable warheads during the 13 days .
 Kennedy’s cabinet tried to persuade the president to invade Cuba . This uncertainty encouraged hawks in Kennedy's cabinet to try to persuade him to do so .
 After the crisis, Nitze would say that the dangers of the Missile Crisis were exaggerated, existing mostly in McNamara’s head .
 In 1992, at a Blight/Lang conference in Havana, Nitze was proven to be completely and utterly wrong . Nitze proved to be wrong in 1992, when he was proven wrong at Blight and Lang conference .
 Anatoly Gribkov revealed that all the missiles en route to Cuba had been transported onto the island before the blockade went up . Anatoly: All the missiles were transported onto Cuba before the embargo went up.
 Gribkov’s deployment included not just mediumand long-range missiles targeting U.S. cities . The Russian commander of the Russian-held Crimea is believed to be a key ally in the region .
 These were cruise missiles with a range of about 90 miles, and ground-to-ground Luna missiles . Luna missiles were launched in the 1980s and 1990s . The U.S. launched the first Luna missiles in 1961 .
 Gen. Gribkov also stated that, in his judgment, the Russian commander on the island, Gen. Gen. Vladimir Putin's actions were justified . The Russian commander in charge of the Russian forces in the region also said that he did not believe the Russian troops should be allowed to
 Issa Pliyev, would have used them if Kennedy had listened to Nitze and launched an amphibious assault on the island . Kennedy would have listened to the Soviet Union's request to use the amphibious forces .
 If that had happened, the entire American invasion force would have likely been incinerated . The entire invasion force was likely incinerated, the author says .
 This would have undoubtedly led to an American nuclear strike against the island . The island would have been hit by a nuclear strike by the US .
 Whatever missiles survived on the island would have been launched against the U.S. The U.N. would have launched missiles, experts say .
 This strike would likely have been coupled with a Russian counterstrike, CNN says . And this strike would have been likely to have been paired with a counterstrike .
 Pliyev’s operational decision to use tactical nukes was a major decision, he says . The Russian president says he was stunned by the information .
 He ripped off his translating headset and started waving his arms in disbelief . He ripped it off his headset and waved his arms as he tried to keep up with his translation .
 As the man who would have ordered that amphibious assault, he obviously was unaware that it would have been the last order he, or anyone else, ever gave .
 Blight and Yang have worked so hard to render as much information as possible on the Missile Crisis . Their long relationship with the late Robert McNamara led them to their work .
 McNamara's learning curve on the crisis had taught him just how dangerous hawks like Nitze were in Kennedy’s ExComm. At this last appearance, McNamara said, “I’m not surprised”
 McNamara warned his young audience that they were lucky to be alive today . McNamara: "I'm not surprised that I'm alive today"
 If President Kennedy had made one wrong move, “the world would have been destroyed instantly or made unlivable in October 1962,’s Gribkov said .
 The Armageddon Letters opens with a call from the grave by McNamara . This is the warning that the book opens with, the book, The Armageddon letters, opens with .
 The book closes with a similar warning, except it’s from someone on the other side of the conflict, someone who is still alive . The book ends with the same warning, but it's from someone else who is alive .
 After Fidel Castro’s near fatal illness of 2007, he stepped down from his presidential office . Fidel Castro was forced to step down from the post in 2007 after his illness .
 Today, like McNamara, after living through the Missile Crisis, his life’s cause is to rid the world of nuclear weapons . McNamara: "Today, today, I’m looking forward to seeing the end of the nuclear weapons"
 With his son Fidelito he spends much time as a blogger against nuclear weapons . Spends much time spreading the word of Albert Einstein about the horrors that nuclear explosions could render to the atmosphere .
 Blight and Yang have done something that serves as the capstone to their work in this field . Between these two quite moving warnings, Blight has done something quite moving .
 They have assembled all the known correspondence between the three principals during the Missile Crisis . The three principals were involved in the missile crisis .
 Letters from Castro and Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev to Khruschev to both men . The letters include letters from both men and the Russian Premier . Castro, Kennedy and Kennedy wrote the letters to Khushchev .
 Interspersed with these first-person accounts, the book fills in what happened as a result of the actions in the letters . The book also details what occurred afterwards, in 1963-64 .
 The installation of the missiles was confirmed by U-2 photography . As many commentators have written, there were two reasons that Kennedy reacted as he did when the installation was confirmed .
 The Russians continually lied about what their intentions were, and also about the actual nature of the weapons . First, the Russians lied about their intentions, and then lied about the nature of their weapons, CNN says .
 The Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba was just five days after the U.S.-backed invasion failed . Three days after it failed, the Bay of Pics returned to Cuba . The invasion failed three days later .
 16 months later, Kennedy was reading reports that a large, multi-site missile installation was under construction . Hundreds of Soviet managers and workers were on the island working on them, he says .
 Part of the installation included SAM sites, that is, surface-to-air missiles . Further, that part of this installation included surface to air missiles . The installation includes SAM sites and SAM sites .
 Kennedy concluded that the purpose of these would be to protect offensive missiles, i.e., those meant to attack the U.S. Kennedy concluded .
 Kennedy had repeatedly warned the Russians and Cubans about the weapons they were using . Kennedy had warned Russia and Cuba about the dangers of such weapons . Kennedy: "These types of weapons"
 JFK did not want Cuba to become a forward staging base for an advance attack by the Soviets on America . JFK’s warning: Cuba should not be a forward base for a Soviet advance attack .
 Kennedy made a speech warning Khrushchev about this in public . Kennedy made the speech on Sept. 22, 1962, on Sept., 1962 .
 He also told his brother Robert to warn Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that offensive missiles would not be tolerated in Cuba . But he also told him to warn the ambassador .
 Khrushchev and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko did not inform Dobrynin about the nuclear installation prior to it occurring . The installation occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1960s .
 This was part of a systematic plan to conceal in advance, and then to lie about the installation once it was achieved, says the author of the book . He said: ‘This was a systematic scheme to conceal and then lie about it’
 Kennedy understood the size and scale of the gamble Khrushchev was taking . On Oct. 1962, Kennedy asked Gromyko face-to-face about the installation .
 In one stroke, the Russians would close the missile gap and assemble a first-strike force in Cuba . The Russians would also close the gap in Cuba with a first strike force .
 In Khrushchev’s very first letter to Kennedy Nov., 1960 he concludes with his desire “to settle the German issue” at the earliest date . In fact, in fact, he ends his letter with a desire to settle the issue at any point .
 As the book makes clear, the Cubans did not agree with this secrecy and lying, the book says . The book is published in New York, New York and London .
 Both Castro and Che Guevara predicted that if the secret mission was exposed Kennedy would suspect the worst . Kennedy would have suspected the worst if the mission was revealed .
 This disagreement among the communist leaders implicitly relates to the size and scale of the installation . This disagreement is implicitly related to the scale and size of the operation .
 If a mutual defense treaty had been announced and the Russians stated they were only shipping a limited amount of defensive tactical atomic weapons into Cuba, Kennedy would have had to resist the deployment .
 President Eisenhower approved the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 . Both he and President Dwight Eisenhower had approved the invasion . President Kennedy approved of the invasion in 1961, and he approved of it .
 Kennedy and Soviet specialist Llewellyn Thompson were suspicious of the Berlin motive . The presence of the nuclear triad the Russians had assembled was the reason for the Berlin attack .
 The Soviets had also given the Cubans IL-28 nuclear bombers plus submarines that carried nuclear torpedoes .
 This arsenal was simply too huge and lethal to be simply a defense against another invasion. This arsenal is simply too large and lethal. It's simply too big and lethal .
 Khrushchev refuses to acknowledge that the missiles are there for offensive purposes . The correspondence shows that through all of September and well into the October crisis, Khrushche refused to acknowledge .
 As Castro and Che Guevara predicted, this simply stiffened Kennedy’s resolve . Kennedy's resolve was stiffened by the death of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader .
 Kennedy grew angry and resentful about all the lying, especially at Gromyko's, authors write . Kennedy figured that the foreign minister had known the full size and scope of the installation .
 Kennedy felt betrayed by the Russian premier who had congratulated him on his election victory . Kennedy had discussed plans for making Cuba part of an overall plan for peaceful coexistence between the East and West .
 Kennedy then reminded Khrushchev that he had already warned him about any such deployment the month before . Kennedy then said he had warned him that he was already in danger .
 At this point, not knowing that all the missiles had already been delivered, the ExComm decided upon its strategy of the blockade . The ExComm did not know that the missiles were already delivered .
 Kennedy was quite aware that any kind of miscommunication or mistake could provide a trigger for Armageddon . Kennedy was aware of the danger of a miscommunication .
 He also ordered low-level U-2 over-flights of Cuba to determine when the missiles had become operational . The U.2 was ordered by the Cuban government to find out when missiles were operational .
 Kennedy penned a letter to Khrushchev accusing him of secretly delivering nuclear missiles into Cuba . On Oct. 1962, Kennedy wrote a letter accusing Khruschev of delivering missiles to Cuba . Kennedy: "I'm sure you can't wait to find out what happened in Cuba"
 He then alerted him as to when the blockade would go into effect and warned him not to try and circumvent it . He then warned him that he would not be able to circumvent the blockade .
 Khrushchev was finally convinced that Kennedy had fully discovered the scope of the installation . On the deliverance of this letter, Khrushvic was convinced . Kennedy was convinced that this letter had been delivered .
 He then became enraged at General Pliyev, for he found out that he had not camouflaged the construction sites .
 Pliyev replied that the sites would now be camouflaged to disguise the progress of the construction . Pliyeva: The sites will now be disguised to disguise progress of construction .
 Khrushchev now realized that the warnings to him by Castro and Che Guevara were well-founded, for he had left himself no fallback position . The Soviet Union leader now realized he had not left himself a fallback option .
 Khrushchev ordered all missiles to be fueled and readied; all pilots to stand by at their nuclear bombers . The Soviet leader ordered all pilots standing by to protect his nuclear bombers from the attack .
 A few hours later, knowing that all the missiles were on the island, he changed his mind and told the Russian ships to stop at the quarantine line . He later told the Russians to stop their ships at a quarantine line instead .
 The last ship carrying nuclear warheads into Cuba had just avoided the construction of the blockade by a few hours .
 This is a central point of misunderstanding about the crisis, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 In popular renditions of the event in the television film The Missiles of October, and the feature film Thirteen Days the moment on Oct. 31, when the Russian ships stopped at the quarantine line is depicted as a culminating victory .
 The U-2 flights could not really detect when missiles were ready to be set in silos and launched . Therefore, the U.2 flights were not able to detect when the missiles were set in the silos .
 Some members of the ExComm had determined that the setting of the missiles in the silos was the point of no return . This is an important point, for some . The ExComm has determined that this is not the end of the process .
 According to that view, America would have to send an air strike to preempt the launches . The U.S. would then have to launch a missile strike, the analyst says .
 At this point in the crisis, President Kennedy and his brother began to enact a tactic to impress upon Khrushchev just how desperate the situation was, even after the Russians ships had stopped .
 In Oct. Kennedy hinted to the Russians there were forces inside the ExComm and Pentagon that he might not be able to control much longer . In his letter of Oct.
 Khrushchev had lied to Kennedy, which had made Kennedy look foolish in their eyes . He coupled this with the fact that since Khruschev lied to him, this had made him look foolish . Kennedy had been looking foolish in the eyes of the Russians .
 An exchange of the American Jupiter missiles in Turkey for the Russian missiles in Cuba . The exchange took place between the U.S. and the Soviet Union .
 Bobby Kennedy subtly insinuated that his brother would not be able to hold off the ExComm hawks much longer . Bobby Kennedy also insinuated his brother was not able to keep off the excomm hawks . Kennedy's brother was assassinated in 1968 .
 Cubans now firing anti-aircraft missiles at American overflights . Complicating this was the fact that the Cubans were now firing missiles at the U.S.
 In return, Kennedy would make a no-invasion pledge of the island, plus withdraw American missiles from Turkey . Kennedy would also make a pledge of no invasion pledge, plus withdrawal of missiles .
 Khrushchev dictated the long letter in which he outlined a solution to the crisis . After a brief discussion with Gromyko, he called in his stenographer Nedezhda Petrovna and dictated it .
 This particular letter only included a demand for a no-invasion pledge . The letter was sent to the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday .
 Khrushchev was still saying that Kennedy was wrong about the offensive missiles in Cuba . Incredibly, even at this late date, even though this was late, he still said that Kennedy had made a mistake .
 The Soviet leader tried to compare the mediumand long-range missiles with a cannon . The missiles could fly as far as 2,400 miles and deliver an explosion eight times as powerful as Hiroshima .
 Khrushchev also revealed to Kennedy that the reason he decided to obey the blockade was because the missiles were already inside Cuba . Kennedy also revealed that he also said he would obey the embargo because of the missiles .
 In this particular letter, the demands for removal of the Jupiters were not mentioned .
 The next day, after getting an intelligence report about Kennedy’s willingness to consider a trade of the missiles, he summoned Gromyko again . Kennedy was willing to trade the missiles in exchange for the missiles .
 He has asked that an amended version of the first letter be sent, adding a request for the missile exchange as a part of the negotiations .
 Defense Minister Rodion Malinovsky spoke to the Presidium on Oct. 10 . Defense Minister Malinovski spoke to Presidium that afternoon .
 All the warheads had now been mounted on ICBM’s and ready to be launched . He said that all the warheads were now mounted on the ICBM's and ready for launch .
 Two days earlier, Russia had agreed to abide by the blockade . Recall, this was two days after it had agreed by the Russians . The blockade began two days earlier .
 The blockade had worked only as a cooling-down measure . Therefore, in reality, the blockade had been only a cooling down measure . The blockade was only a 'cooling down measure'
 Malinovsky then went on to game plan how the nuclear exchange would work . Malinovastovsky then explained how the plan would work in a nuclear exchange .
 He gave special attention to how the Soviets could target U.S. allies in Europe . The Soviets were able to target America's European allies .
 Khrushchev interrupted to ask Pliyev if he understood that no one could order the launching of the missiles in Cuba except him . Khrisschev interrupted him to ask him if he knew no one had ordered the launch of the missile launch .
 Due to a misunderstanding in orders, Castro was allowed to use the Russian installed SAM’s to effect the only fatality by enemy fire of the crisis . Castro was killed in the attack .
 Rudolf Anderson, America's best U-2 pilot, was shot down over Banes, Cuba . Anderson was the U.S. best U.2 pilot in the world . Anderson died in the crash over Cuba .
 Khrushchev feared this would send a terrible message to Kennedy that the U.S. president might read it as a sign that the Russians were behind it . It was feared that the United States president would read it a sign of an air war over Cuba .
 When news of this event was delivered to Kennedy, the hawks in the ExComm did use it to press him into an air strike against the SAM’s . There was a plan in place to do just that in case this happened .
 He moved to take out the SAM site at Banes and then begin an air war over Cuba .
 JFK turned the discussion around to formulating a reply to this new letter and how to approach the added request for the removal of the Jupiters . JFK has been in the process of responding to the request .
 Kennedy rejected an air war at the beginning of the crisis . He was rejecting one near the end . Kennedy rejected one at the start of the war .
 In fact, this second letter was essentially what Kennedy wanted to hear . Kennedy wanted it to hear, and it's not what he really wanted .
 RFK assured Dobyrnin that the Jupiters would be removed after negotiations with Turkey . RFK had assured Dobynin that he would remove them .
 Khrushchev had not negotiated the agreement with Castro’s input . But as Blight and Lang demonstrate, this was still not the end of the crisis . The crisis was not over until the end, and Khrushche had not secured the agreement .
 Fidel Castro said he was willing to launch a preemptive strike at America to prevent any invasion . Fidel had actually proposed the day before, to the Russian representative Aleksander Alekseev, that he was prepared to strike .
 Khrushchev got Castro’s request, plus the news that the Russians had permitted Castro to use their radar equipment to shoot down Anderson, he was convinced that matters were now slipping beyond his control . The Russians had been permitted to use radar equipment .
 He relayed orders that, under no circumstances, was any Russian equipment to be used to fire at any American plane flying over Cuba . The order was relayed by the Cuban president .
 Khrushchev did not trust Fidel Castro, who he considered immature and suicidal, to take part in the negotiations, or even have knowledge of them . He considered him immature, suicidal and suicidal .
 At this point, Khrushchev was intent on convincing Kennedy that the President’s tentative positive reply was amenable to him . Kennedy was trying to convince him that his tentative reply to the offer was also amenable . The proposal was also sent on Oct. 11, 1962 .
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk instructed to have U.N. announce trade for Jupiters if Russians needed public assurance for it .
 Robert Kennedy assured Dobrynin the Jupiters would be removed, and they were . Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 . Kennedy's assassination was the first to be carried out .
 He thought they could be knocked out before then without a counterattack from the island . Therefore, he thought that they could . be knocked . out before . then . without counterattack .
 With what we now know, this shows just how poor the intelligence was on the U.S. side, it shows how poor it was for the Americans .
 Kennedy felt admiration for McNamara for dealing with Pentagon hawks during the crisis . Kennedy always felt both admiration and pity for him .
 Castro felt betrayed by his Russian allies and abused by the U.S. on the island, Castro said . Castro felt betrayal by Russia and the United States . Castro said he felt abused by both sides .
 Khrushchev promised Kennedy on-site inspection to see if all the nuclear weapons had been removed, including bombers and submarines . Kennedy had promised to inspect the site, including the bombers and sub bombers .
 Castro would countenance no inspectors in Cuba no matter who they were . Castro would not have allowed inspectors to inspect Cuba . Castro's government would not allow inspectors to enter Cuba .
 Castro made this clear when U.N. Chairman U Thant arrived, Castro said . Castro made it clear to him that he was not interested in the situation . Castro said: "When United Nations Chairman U. Thant arrives, Castro made that clear"
 Castro sent an ultimatum to the UN with five demands to be met before he would even consider inspection . Castro even sent a five-point list of demands to meet before even considering inspection .
 The Russians sent one of their finest diplomats, Anastas Mikoyan, to Cuba to make sure he would not scuttle the deal . Castro was so recalcitrant that the Russians sent him to Cuba . The deal was eventually scrapped .
 Kennedy and Khrushchev finally worked out an arrangement in which the ships carrying back the weapons would be checked by helicopter at sea . The ships would then be searched by helicopter .
 He managed to convince Castro not to resist the removal of the IL-28 bombers . Castro agreed to remove the bombers from Cuba .
 Castro was surprised at the depth of resentment Castro held toward the Russians, a diplomat says . Castro's resentment toward Russia was surprising, he says .
 Castro complained to U Thant that he only heard about the final agreement in a radio broadcast from Miami . Castro complained that he was only told about the deal in radio broadcast . Castro: "I don't want to see what's going to happen in the U.S. before I
 Castro forbidden to use anti-aircraft guns against over-flights during process of Soviet withdrawal . During process of withdrawal, Castro was forbidden to fight over-flight .
 By Nov., he refused to cooperate with that particular policy any longer . By Nov. he refused cooperation any longer. He said, "By Nov. 2018, I'm not going to cooperate"
 The authors understand that it was this split between Havana and Moscow that allowed the crisis to end up with a totally unexpected turn . None of the main actors could have predicted, they say .
 Castro had become suspicious of Russian assurances that he tried for a normalization of relations with the U.S. The authors explain that Castro became suspicious of Russia's assurances . Castro was so suspicious of the assurances he tried to normalize relations with Russia .
 This initiative began about a month after the removal of the last missiles from Cuba . The initiative began a month ago .
 When Kennedy first got news about Castro’s interest in a rapprochement, he was also quite interested . Kennedy was also very interested .
 An intricate backchannel was created to avoid the communications from going public . And as several authors have described, several authors described, it was then created to create a backchannel .
 Both sides understood that, if that occurred, it could be fatal to their progress . Both sides understand that if that happened, it would be fatal for them .
 On Kennedy’s side the couriers were ABC reporter Lisa Howard, American diplomat William Attwood, and French journalist Jean Daniel .
 In just 11 months, Kennedy and Castro were talking about sending Attwood into Mexico in order to fly to Cuba to begin preliminary discussions for dÃ©tente . Attwood sent Attwood to Mexico to begin talks with Cuba . Kennedy, Castro and Cuban leaders were talking in just 11
 Kennedy said that he was in agreement with Castro and Che Guevara’s ideas about the Batista regime which preceded the Cuban revolution . Kennedy said he agreed with Castro's idea of the revolution .
 Kennedy went on to say that he understood the terrible exploitation, colonization and humiliation the history of Cuba represented to its citizens . Kennedy: "I understand the horrible exploitation and humiliation Cuba has suffered"
 He also understood that America had played a significant role in all this, he said . He said: 'I understand that America has played a major role in this country's history'
 The problem was that Cuba, because of its Soviet ties, had become part of the Cold War . This had led to the Missile Crisis . The problem now is that Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union is at risk .
 When this message was personally delivered to Castro through Daniel, Fidel was overjoyed . Fidel Castro was personally delighted to receive the message .
 He told him Kennedy would now go down as the greatest president since Lincoln . Kennedy would go down in history as the most successful president since Abraham Lincoln, he said .
 Castro got the news that Kennedy had been shot in Dallas on the third day of his presidency . Castro was Castro's first president in office .
 This was the end of the last and best hope for normalization of relations between Castro’s regime and the U.S. Castro's regime was the last hope of normalizing relations with the United States .
 Some observers suspect that the CIA was monitoring the backchannel may have led to Kennedy’s death .
 Blight and Yang note the loss of hope and lost hope in the world's first great war .
 Both Kennedy and Khrushchev realized how close the world had come to nuclear war . Kennedy realized that the world was about to go to war with the Soviets .
 Leaders attempted to attain closer relations between the two countries . The leaders attempted to achieve closer relations .
 A test ban treaty was worked out to limit development of more nuclear missiles . The treaty was also worked out in order to prevent further nuclear missile tests .
 President Obama said a dÃ©tente with Russia had to be achieved or we would run the risk of another nuclear crisis . Russia is the closest ally in the Middle East .
 As long as Kennedy was alive, this goal was in sight and Khrushchev was safe . The goal was still in sight, as long as JFK was alive .
 After Kennedy was killed, Khrushchev wept, for he understood that the Kennedy-Khrushchev plan for peaceful coexistence was dead, too . After Kennedy's death, he wept for understanding that the plan for peace was dead .
 In November 1963, through special diplomat William Walton, the surviving Kennedys sent a message to Moscow telling Khrushchev that their plans for peace would now be put on hold . The surviving members of the family sent the message in November 1963 .
 The suspicion was that President Kennedy had been killed by a large rightwing conspiracy . Lyndon Johnson was much too close to big business interests to pursue the ideal of reversing the arms race and seeking a meaningful peace .
 From that office, he mounted a run for the presidency in 1968 after Johnson, deeply scarred by Vietnam War, announced that he would not seek reelection .
 If RFK had won if he had not been assassinated, too the Kennedy-Khrushchev vision might have resumed . RFK was assassinated in 1968 .
 The problem from the Soviet side was that once JFK was dead, Khrushchev was vulnerable to the likes of Leonid Brezhnev, who had looked upon his venture in Cuba with nothing but scorn . The problem was that after JFK's death, once the Soviet leader was dead
 The charges that caused Khrushchev's demise were drawn up by Dmitri Polyansky, a member of the Presidium . Polyansky was an ally of Brezhnev’s and became his deputy after his overthrow . The charges were made up by Polyansky .
 Some of the Brezhnev-Polyansky charges specifically named Khrushchev’s ‘hare-brained scheme’ in Cuba which had brought the world to the brink of catastrophe . The charges were made against the Soviet-Russian regime .
 Jim DiEugenio is a researcher and writer on the assassination of President John F Kennedy and other mysteries of that era . He is also a member of the Kennedy assassination team .
 Those documents routinely got retracted or just buried each new administration . Those documents were routinely retracted or buried with each administration .
 Dimona was a French product and their antisemitism at that time, rivaled the Nazis . Dimona is now a popular brand of clothing worn in the U.S.
 De Gaulle’s vociferous antisemitic remarks, his resignation and the election of Georges Pompidou did not inspire much hope in Israel . The French prime minister's resignation from the French government in 1958 was a major embarrassment .
 Israelis counted on Pompidou and his closeness to the Rothschild family to lift the weapons embargo . However he kept it all in place .
 Dimona was a subconscious expression, if you will, of French hostility to Israel, in that, it inspired envy and hate among most of it’s Arab neighbors . Dimona is an expression of France's hostility toward Israel, and it was an expression in that way .
 To this very day, Dimona continues to create endless political quandaries for Israel . Dimona remains a source of endless political problems for the country .
 A wonderfully written concise telling of the events and letters during that frightening time. Duke Duke . Duke December 1, 2012 at 23:08 .
 Lots of insights into the workings of the Soviet Union’s leader mind in this biography .
 They did use the Taubman book. James DiEugenio says .
 Many Americans feel a sadness looking back on that period in U.S. History . Hillary Clinton: "I'm sorry for what happened to me and my family" Hillary Clinton says she is saddened by the events of that period .
 Perhaps we would not now be controlled by the Federal Reserve Bank and Israel would not have nuclear weapons . Israel would have no nuclear weapons and the U.S. wouldn't have been controlled by Federal Reserve .
 JFK demonstrated fantastic ‘statesmanship’ over the Cuban Crisis . Whatever his faults, JFK demonstrated ‘statemanship” over Cuban crisis . JFK demonstrated great statesmanship .
 Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to basically strip the Bank of its power to loan money to the U.S. Federal Government at interest .
 For over 2 years Israel had refused requests to come clean over its nuclear program . Things came to a head with a personal letter dated May 18, 1963 to Israeli leader Ben Gurion warning that unless American inspectors were allowed into Dimona Israel would find itself totally isolated .
 Many Americans believe the assassination of JFK was a “Coup d’Ã©tat” Hillary, read my rebuttal below by elmerfudzie, the comment got bumped down again .

 "Really disappointed the readers are more excited by snarking with r and b than the amazing breadth of your ability to condense so much material into a coherent solid monograph," says the author .
 I recall a classmate refusing to duck under the desk, and instead calmly walked outside and standing in the school playing field during the drill . Cheers to anyone ready for real discourse on the topic at hand .
 It's now clear that the whole crisis atmosphere was exacerbated by a persistent cold war mentality in top brass circles . To the school’s credit it did not make an issue of it or discipline her .
 The article insinuates that had the older Kennedy brother survived WWII, we all wouldn’t be here today . The article seems to insinuate that had . had . the older . Kennedy brother survive WWII, it would have been a disaster .
 JFK was not a pivotal figure in resolving this episode, in fact his presidency may have instigated it . JFK's presidency may not have resolved this issue, but it may have led to this crisis .
