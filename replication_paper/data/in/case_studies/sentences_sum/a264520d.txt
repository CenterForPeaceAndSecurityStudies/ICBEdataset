 American U-2, piloted by Major Rudolph Anderson, Jr., was detected over eastern part of Cuba . SAM site at Los Angeles, near Banes, in Oriente province, fired one or several antiaircraft missiles .
 Several conflicting interpretations have been advanced to explain the strange incident of the downing of the U-2 . The U.2 was shot down by a U.S. Navy jetliner in the early 1990s .
 According to Seymour Hersh, Cuban army unit attacked and overran a Soviet-manned SAM base at Los Angeles, near Banes, in the Oriente province, killing many Soviets and seizing control .
 Hersh based his article on information partly drawn from an interview with Daniel Ellsberg, who was himself citing classified material from a post-crisis study .
 The speculation was based on an intercepted transmission from the Soviet base at Los Angeles indicating heavy fighting and casualties . The Soviets were believed to have been involved in heavy fighting in Los Angeles .
 Adrián Montoro, former director of Radio Havana Cuba, and Juan Antonio Rodríguez Menier, a senior Cuban intelligence officer who defected in 1987, confirmed Ellsberg's information .
 The news that a U-2 had been shot down in Cuba reached the ExComm (Executive Committee of the National Security Council) Most members thought that war was just around the corner . The ExComm thought that a war was imminent .
 If a U-2 were shot down, the SAM battery responsible would be knocked off, the U.2 would be immediately knocked off . In fact, they had decided earlier that if a U.-2 was shot down they would knock off the battery .
 Carlos Franqui, a journalist who at the time was close to Castro, wrote that Castro himself told him that he had given the order to shoot down the plane . He said Castro wanted to see if there was to be war or not .
 Khrushchev gave his own version of the event in his Memoirs, which confirmed Franqui’s story . Some years later, in his memoirs, Khrushchevsky wrote about the incident in which he gave his account .
 Castro’s second attempt to push the U.S. and the Soviet Union into a nuclear Armageddon failed . Fortunately, cool heads prevailed . Cool heads prevailed.
 Castro wrote to Khrushchev that an American invasion of Cuba was imminent . He asked that the Soviet Union should launch a preemptive nuclear attack against the U.S.
 Castro emphatically denied that he had ever asked Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack against the U.S. A few days later, splitting semantic hairs, split semantic hairs . But Khrushchchev was adamant .
 The missiles had been installed to deter a U.S. invasion of the island . The missiles were installed in the hope of deterring a United States invasion .
 The problem with that assertion is that Khrushchev didn’t want to protect Castro, he says . The problem is that, in the first place, he didn't want Castro to be protected, he adds .
 Castro had become a liability, not an asset, President Obama says . Castro wanted to get rid of him because Castro was a liability not asset, he says .
 The presence of Soviet medium-range strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba was never confirmed . Secondarily, the presence of the USSR's nuclear missiles was never officially confirmed .
 Khrushchev claims that the main reason for sending strategic missiles to Cuba was because Castro feared an American invasion . In his memoirs he claims that Castro feared a U.S. invasion of Cuba .
 Khrushchev planned to install missiles in Cuba to protect Castro . But it is very difficult to believe that Khrushche planned to do so . The missiles were installed in Cuba in order to protect the Cuban leader .
 Nikta Khrushchev would never had placed nuclear warheads near the hands of trigger-happy Castro Castro . In the first place, because Nikta . Khrush . would never have placed nuclear . warheads . near the . hands of the trigger happy Castro . Castro .
 Khrushchev himself had tried to overthrow the Cuban leader by force in April 1962, when he allegedly got the idea, in April .
 Castro discovered the plot, neutralized it, and expelled from Cuba Soviet Ambassador Sergei Kudryatvsev and his embassy thugs . The plot was in coordination with some members of the pro-Soviet Cuban Communist party, according to Castro .
 Other sources claim Castro detained Kudryavtsev and placed him under military custody until he was embarked on a Moscow-bound Soviet plane . Other sources, however, claim that actually Castro detained him and put him in military custody .
 The presence of Soviet medium-range strategic missiles and their nuclear warheads on Cuban soil has never been proved . Moreover, despite a mountain of books claiming the contrary, the presence of the missiles and nuclear warheads is never proved . Despite a mountain .
 CIA photo interpreters showed president Kennedy U-2 photos confirming the presence of SS-4 Sandal Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba . According to current Cuban missile crisis mythology, in the morning of October 16, 1962, U.2 photos confirmed the existence of the missiles .
 This was the ultimate, incontrovertible proof that the Soviets had secretly deployed strategic missile bases in Cuba . The Cuban missile bases were the ultimate proof of the Soviet presence in Cuba, author says .
 Photos show long wooden crates covered by tarps, which the CIA believed contained missiles . What the photos show is is long crates covered with tarps . The CIA believed the crates contained the missiles, but they are not missiles .
 The photos also show some concrete bunkers, which the CIA believed contained nuclear warheads for the missiles . The CIA believed the bunkers contained the nuclear warheads .
 Photos show Soviet ships sailing out of Cuba with long wooden crates covered with tarps on their decks . The CIA believed the crates contained missiles . There are also photos of Soviet ships with wooden crates .
 The presence of Soviet strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962, much less their nuclear warheads, has never been proved . As I mentioned above, the presence of . Soviet strategic . nuclear missiles was never proved .
 Robert McNamara asked if the U.S. knew whether the nuclear warheads for the missiles were in Cuba too . In a session with newsmen in the Pentagon on the night of October 22, less than an hour after Kennedy’s speech, McNamara said .
 One of the undying myths about the U.S.’s inability to tame Castro for so many years is the existence of the secret Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact . Some people liked to call it “agreement,” or “understanding,�
 With the world at the brink of nuclear war, he struck a deal with the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, in which he promised that the United States would never invade Cuba . The deal ensured that the communists could maintain their outpost 90 miles away from American shores in perpetuity
 Contrary to popular belief, the famous Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact never existed . The pact was signed by the Soviet Union in 1961, but never happened .
 The problem with the existence of such a document, or even with such an “agreement” or “understanding,” is that in any compromise both parties agree to do something . The problem is that the problem with such a deal is that both sides agree to
 Khrushchev agreed to remove the nuclear missiles from Cuba in exchange for the American promise not to invade Cuba . According to the prevalent myth, the deal was made in return for a U.S. promise to not invade Cuba in Cuba .
 Available evidence shows that no Soviet nuclear missiles were ever on the island . No one is going to believe that President Kennedy was so naïve as to exchange something for nothing .
 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger hunted through State Department files looking for written agreement he was sure President Kennedy had signed with Khrushchev . Kissinger was concerned over the submarine base the Soviets were building in Cienfuegos, a port on the Southern coast of Cuba .
 He discovered, to his utter amazement, that there was none, either oral or in writing . He was amazed to discover that there were no oral or written records .
 If the agreement ever existed, it has the dubious honor of being one of the few international agreements to have been applied a priori, long before it was signed . The U.S. government’s harassment of anti-Castro Cubans in the United States began a year
 The non-existing Kennedy-Khrushchev pact is nothing but a concoction to justify the unjustifiable . Kennedy and Khrushchev's pact was nothing more than a pact to defend the unjustified .
 Despite rhetoric on the contrary, American presidents have proved unwilling to get rid of Fidel Castro . It is not because a non-existent pact forbids them to do so, but because of some hidden motives unknown to the public .
 Recent evidence points to the killing of Che Guevara, Salvador Allende, the assassination of Hugo Chávez and perhaps even the downing of the Cuban airliner in 1973 were CIA-Castro joint operations . The killing of Salvador Allende and the assassination of Hugo
 I could keep deconstructing one by one most assertions about Castro Hornberger wrote in his article, but that would made this one too long . Hornberger's article was published in the New York Times this week .
 President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act in July 1947 . The act effectively officialized the already-existing national security state . All key positions of these organizations, as well as State Department, have been under the control of CFR members .
 The national security state has been the tool these people have used to advance their spurious goals under a cover of patriotism, says Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: National security state is a tool they've used in advance of advancing spurious goals . He says it's a tool to advance spurious goals
 As I mentioned above, the available evidence indicates that the Cuban missile crisis was a hoax . The available evidence suggests that this is not true .
 There were never nuclear warheads in Cuba, among other reasons, because never before or after the crisis had the Soviets deployed nuclear warheads beyond their borders .
 Dozens of books and hundreds of articles have been written, mostly by secret agents of the national security state, trying to scare us about how close we were to the brink of nuclear annihilation during the Cuban missile crisis . Nonetheless, dozens of books are written, most by secret state agents .
 President Kennedy ordered the removal of the fuses and warheads from the Jupiter missiles in Turkey . But, if this is true, how can we explain that, at the most critical moment during the crisis, he says .
 Some people at the highest levels of the U.S. government knew of the danger, including Castro's efforts . For these and other reasons it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, except for Castro’s efforts, there was no great danger of a nuclear confrontation .
 The bottom line is that the national security state is not a cause, but a symptom, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: The security state should not be a cause for national security problems .
 It is just the efficient tool some powerful people have been using to advance their evil plans of world domination and slavery, a plan they euphemistically call the New World Order . The plan is called the 'New World Order'
 Fidel Castro is the same people who put him in power in Cuba in 1959 . They have kept him there untouched for more than half a century . Fidel Castro's secret agent has been in power since 1959 .
 These are the same people who are trying harder to keep Castroism alive and well in Cuba even after the death of Castro . Castroism is still alive in Cuba .
