 McCone told Kennedy and Eisenhower that at least four kinds of Soviet short-range missiles remained in Cuba . Hundreds of surface-to-surface missiles remained, including hundreds of surface to-air missiles .
 A number of these were so-called dual-use missiles, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear warheads . The missiles were capable of carrying conventional and nuke warheads .
 Although they posed no direct threat to the continental United States, they could not reach any American cities . They were able to strike the United States naval base at Guantánamo and United States ships close to the coast of Cuba .
 If Kennedy at some point ordered an invasion of the island, the U.S. troops might well be 1.0 percent .
 The continued presence of these military forces allowed critics to accuse the White House of turning a blind eye to the establishment of a Soviet base on America’s doorstep . The White House has been accused of turning the blind eye on the establishment .
 This article examines how the Kennedy administration assessed the risk posed by the Soviet short-range missiles in Cuba and the associated combat troops . It also examines the post-crisis settlement period in Cuba .
 The issue had a strong domestic political subtext that played out long after the famous fortnight of late October ended . The issue was the subject of much of October's biggest political controversy .
 Missiles in Cuba had been a topic of discussion well before the events of October 1962 . The intelligence for 1959 reporting claims by refugees that Soviet missiles were present in Cuba was reportedly four inches thick .
 Many studies assume a ªnal resolution to the crisis that did not actually exist either in October 1962 or afterward . Many of the studies assume that a resolution didn't exist either either in 1962 or after .
 Khrushchev’s dramatic retreat on 28 October alleviated the sense of imminent peril but left many critical issues unresolved . The dramatic retreat left many questions unanswered .
 The “November crisis” that ensued played out differently from the scenario envisaged by Khrushchev . The crisis played out in a different way than the planned crisis envisaged in Khrushchi's vision .
 Rather than negotiating from a position of strength to compel the U.S. to accept Soviet demands on a number of key issues, Khrushchev tried desperately to salvage something from his aborted venture in the Caribbean .
 Fidel Castro refused to allow international weapons inspectors into Cuba to verify that the MRBMs and bombers had left and were not being reintroduced . Much to Washington’s frustration, Fidel Castro remained in power .
 Thousands of Soviet combat troops and technicians remained in Cuba, as did much of the sophisticated weaponry they had brought with them . Many of the weapons they brought in with them were still in Cuba .
 The United States Joint Chiefs of Staff continued to prepare to invade Cuba if the diplomatic settlement fell apart . The U.S. Joint chiefs of Staff continue to prepare for the invasion .
 The lifting of the U.S. naval blockade of Cuba on 20 November was not the end of the crisis . Even the lifting of a naval blockade on Cuba did not end the crisis.
 Much of this ‘unªnished business,” as Kennedy called it in February 1963, was never fully resolved . Much of the “un’s” business, as Kennedy said in 1963, has never been fully resolved.
 Cuba remained a preoccupation within the United States intelligence community and among U.S. policymakers, politicians, and journalists well into 1963 . Cuba remained an important issue in the U.N. intelligence community .
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 1963 that “the Cuban crisis is in no sense over” Rusk said . Rusk was the secretary of state of state at the time .
 In short, the Cuban missile crisis did not simply evaporate on 28 October . It did not just evaporate, but it did not evaporate .
 McCone’s warning to Kennedy and Eisenhower in mid-November implied that the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba would continue to dog the Kennedy administration for months .
 Several thousand Soviet troops armed with sophisticated weaponry remained in Cuba . Rumors persist that the Soviet Union was still hiding MRBMs on the island .
 Their weaponry included several kinds of short-range missiles . Some of the missiles were notable primarily for their nuclear capability .
 The most contentious of these were the so-called Luna missiles (known as Frogs in 6.5) Luna missiles . Luna missiles were known as the 'Luna' missiles .
 The Kennedy administration’s handling of the Cuban missile crisis settlement reveals much about its policies toward Cuba and the Soviet Union . It also reveals its assessment of security risks .
 Analysis of Cuban missile crisis sheds new light on Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba . Soviet tactical nuclear weapons were a known risk for some of the acute phase of the crisis and an acceptable risk during the settlement period .
 The analysis provided here has the further beneªt of elucidating how policy was made in the Kennedy administration . The analysis provides a further insight into how policy decisions were made .
 Scholars have long disagreed about the inºuence of domestic politics before and during the Cuban missile crisis . Scholars have argued that domestic politics was behind the crisis .
 Kennedy’s Cuba policy was made solely on the basis of what was best for the United States, without any regard to domestic politics . Some have argued that a ªrebreak of sorts existed between international policy and domestic politics. Kennedy's Cuba policy may have been the result of
 Revisionists have contended domestic politics offered a negative or cynical motivation for decisions . Kennedy favored unnecessary confrontation over diplomacy, they say .
 The bulk of these studies have focused on the 13 days of peak crisis . This week's focus is to focus on the thirteen days of the crisis .
 The evidence from this period indicates that domestic political considerations were a fundamental factor in Kennedy’s decision-making . The evidence suggests he took a slightly harder line in the post-crisis negotiations with the Soviet Union .
 Evidence suggests Kennedy was willing to accept a degree of permanent military risk in Cuba . Evidence also suggests that Kennedy was more willing than some of his advisers and many Congressional critics .
 Operation Anadyr added tactical nuclear missiles and other sophisticated weapons to the Soviet forces stationed in Cuba in the fall of 1962 . The second phase of the Soviet military buildup in Cuba was the codename for the military buildup .
 The disclosure that tactical nuclear arms were present in Cuba has been described as “probably the single most important revelation about the crisis since the new sources began to emerge” after the end of 9/11 . The disclosure has been called the “single most important” revelation about
 Much of the existing literature reºects uncertainty about when the Kennedy administration learned about these forces, what it knew, and what it decided to do about them . The Kennedy administration has been criticized for its handling of the situation .
 The prevailing view has been that the tactical nuclear missiles were, for the Kennedy administration, an unknown risk of the crisis . U.S. policymakers were seriously considering invasion plans of Cuba ignorant of the risk that they would be confronted with a nuclear battleªeld.
 Newly available materials suggest that this prevailing view requires some elaboration and revision . Newly available material suggests that this view must be revised .
 The controversy about tactical nuclear missiles in Cuba was sparked at an important international history conference in Havana in January 1992 . It marked the thirtieth anniversary of the crisis .
 The conference brought together a number of former ofªcials from the U.S. and the former Soviet Union and leading Cuban scholars .
 General Anatoli Gribkov was one of the Soviet military ofªcers responsible for coordinating Soviet deployments in Cuba in 1962 . He seemed to claim that Khrushchev had predelegated authority to the local Soviet commander in Cuba, General Issa Pliev, to use the dozens
 Peter Jennings broke the news to millions of viewers that “battleªeld missiles armed with nuclear warheads . . were deployed in coastal areas” of Cuba during the missile crisis .
 Robert McNamara, secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, stated that the Kennedy administration did not know that tactical nuclear weapons were in Cuba . Gribkov: The Kennedy administration didn't know that the weapons were there .
 He speculated that the Executive Committee of the National Security Council might have given different advice to the president . He said the president might have made different decisions .
 Some old and much new evidence suggests that the 1992 revelations about Soviet tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba should not have stirred as much surprise as they did . The 1992 revelations should have been expected to have surprised many .
 Smith’s comments were quoted in Blight, Allyn, and Welch, Cuba on the Brink, 261. Smith: “Cuba is on the brink of collapse.” Smith: Cuba should be allowed to remain in Cuba .
 Arthur M Schlesinger, Jr., Jr., “Bush’s Thousand Days,” The Washington Post, 29 April 2006, A17. “
 Schlesinger was unaware that his characterization here was outdated and did not take account of the important clariªcations and corrections that had followed Gribkov’s initial statement .
 Evidence now available does not show that U.S. ofªcials knew that nuclear warheads were already present in Cuba . But it does make clear that they explicitly assumed that such warheads had been sent there .
 The administration discussed the Luna missiles in late 1962 and early 1963, both privately and publicly . In any case, the striking thing emerges is the extent to which the administration discussed them .
 In the months after the peak of the crisis, policymakers and military leaders debated whether it was an acceptable risk for those weapons and Soviet troops to stay in Cuba . The United States was insisting that some other types of dual-use weapons be removed .
 Intelligence ofªcials consistently warned that they could not provide deªnitive proof that nuclear warheads were present in Cuba . The Cuban government has said it has never been able to find proof of nuclear warheads .
 Intelligence analysts urged policymakers to assume that nuclear warheads were present in Cuba . In the absence of hard evidence, many took to heart .
 The presence of Frog missiles and Soviet combat troops was tolerated by the Kennedy administration . The Kennedy administration did not want to pay the price of formalizing its no-invasion pledge .
 The presence of tactical nuclear missiles in Cuba was a known risk during the peak of the crisis . It was regarded as an acceptable risk in the post-crisis settlement period . In short, the presence of nuclear missiles was known risk .
 Khrushchev authorized Operation Anadyr on 24 May 1962, it led to a marked acceleration of the buildup of Soviet military forces in Cuba and 24. May 1962 .
 In addition to MRBMs, Anadyr also included at least three types of short-range missiles . The surface-to-surface missiles were the most contentious of the missiles .
 Depending on the model, they were capable of delivering a nuclear warhead with a yield of two to twenty kilotons over a distance of up to 40 kilometers . The missiles were able to deliver a nuclear weapon with a . yield of . two to 20 kilograms over a . distance of
 With launchers mounted on a tracked amphibious tank chassis, the Frogs were highly mobile nuclear artillery . Their solid-propellant rocket motors made them particularly suited to long-term, remote deployments .
 Lunas were considered unremarkable as conventional weapons because they were inaccurate, but when armed with a two-kiloton nuclear warhead they became potent battleªeld weapons . Lunas are now considered potent battle-tested weapons .
 During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transferred different types of Lunas to a number of friends and allies . The Lunas were transferred to Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, North Korea, Syria, South Yemen, and several countries in Eastern Europe .
 The Lunas’ nuclear capability attracted the attention of U.S. analysts and policymakers from the start . In the Cuban case in 1962, the Lunas' nuclear capabilities attracted the . attention of United States analysts and . policymakers .
 U.S. intelligence and military ofªcials detected the Lunas, they singled them out for special mention in reports . They described them as analogous to the United States Army’s Honest Johns .
 Available evidence suggests that the Soviet Union secretly sent 36 Luna rockets to Cuba . Twelve of the rockets were slated to be equipped with “special” warheads . The rockets were intended to be armed with special warheads .
 One study has identified the Luna deployment as consisting of twelve nuclear Frog-5 and 24 conventional Frog-3s . The Luna deployment is thought to be consisting of 12 nuclear Frogs-5s .
 Those designations differ from the ones used by U.S. military intelligence specialists in 1962–1963 . The designations were used by United States military intelligence experts .
 The nuclear warheads for the Lunas arrived in Cuba in October on the Indigirka . They arrived on the island in October .
 Detecting and identifying the Luna missiles proved a challenge for U.S. intelligence . Detecting the missiles proved to be a big problem for the U.K.
 As of late 1962, U.S. defense and intelligence analysts had spotted four variants of Frogs, which they numbered one through four after identifying them visually by the shape of the nose cone .
 U.S. analysts based their assessments on photographs of transporters and launchers . Transporters, launchers were easiest to photograph and identify by virtue of their physical size .
 Soviet forces parked the Frogs in the open, but when low-level U.S. surveillance . began on 23 October, Soviet troops began hiding and camouºaging the weapons .
 Missiles were generally covered or stored in hangars, large tents, or caves and therefore hard to identify from U.S. surveillance . Missiles are generally stored in . hangars or large tents .
 The warheads were even more difªcult to identify directly because they were small . They were easily hidden in bunkers, buildings, or caves, and tightly guarded by Soviet soldiers .
 Intelligence analysts had to rely on circumstantial evidence such as the construction of dome-shaped bunkers and unusual security arrangements . Intelligence analysts are relying on the evidence of bunkers being built .
 Soviet short-range, surface-to-surface missiles were also present in Cuba . Cruise missiles were the first to be detected by U.S. surveillance .
 In the mid-1960s, an updated version with a longer range, designated the Frog-7 by NATO, became the standard standard . The updated version may have been shipped to Cuba to replace the obsolete models . It is believed to have been used in Cuba .
 Since the 1960s, a number of other countries have acquired long-range Frog-5s and Frog-7s, including North Korea . North Korea has also acquired long range Frogs-5, 7s, since the 1970s .
 Warhead yields are the capabilities given the respective weapons based on technical characteristics . The warhead yield is based on the capabilities of each weapon based on its technical characteristics.
 The probability is that the warhead yield will be less than the maximum indicated . The probability of the nuclear strike is that it will not be able to deliver a nuclear bomb .
 FROG 1 and 2 have both a nuclear and high explosive capability, while the FROG 3 has only a nuclear capability . The FROG 2 and 1 have both high explosive and nuclear capabilities .
 The FROG 4 is possibly designed solely for use with high explosive, but could use the FROG 3 warhead . It could also be designed to be used with high-explosion .
 Their combat role in Cuba was primarily for protecting beachheads and targeting the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay .
 U.S. intelligence analysts never identified the FKRs, apparently counting them as Sopka missiles . United States intelligence analysts didn't identify them as F.KRs .
 Khrushchev approved the Soviet Defense Ministry’s proposal to add 80 nuclear warheads for the FKRs in September 1962 . The proposal was approved in the 7 September 1962 revision to the Anadyr plan .
 By far the most numerous of the short-range missiles were the sophisticated surface-to-air missiles . The missiles were known to Soviet commanders as V-75 Volkhovs and to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as SA-2 Guidelines .
 These missiles had a lateral range of 40 to 50 kilometers and an effective vertical range of more than 24 kilometers . The missiles were launched in the 1980s and 1990s .
 The technology behind the V-75 systems was state-of-theart, in some respects more advanced than the Hawk missiles that the U.S. had recently begun supplying to Israel . The technology was developed in the 1980s and 1990s .
 The V-75 missiles conceivably could also be armed with nuclear warheads . U.S. analysts considered such a scenario unlikely, but Soviet air defense forces were never known to have deployed nuclear-tipped V-70s .
 The Soviet Union also had air-to-air missiles and anti-ship missiles in Cuba . The Soviets also had anti-air and air to air missiles in the country .
 Soviet military commanders sent as many as sixteen Komar-class guided-missile patrol boats to Cuba . Komar was one of Russia's most successful military vessels .
 Instead of torpedoes they carried two short-range cruise missiles with conventional warheads . These vessels were similar to motor torpedo boats, but instead of torpedo boats . Instead of torpedoing, they carried cruise missiles .
 The boats were small and fast, but their limited range restricted them to inshore operations . They were best used against ships and amphibious attacks, best used in amphibious operations .
 Of these, 42 were advanced MiG-21 aircraft, a supersonic aircraft that could be used for both interception and ground attack .
 During a press conference on 13 September 1962, the president was asked about the threat posed by the military buildup in Cuba . His answer set forth a dichotomy that framed the issue throughout the crisis and after .
 He said that “defensive weapons” such as those that existed in Cuba at the time 37.5 years ago, such as ‘defensive . weapons,” like those that exist in Cuba, could be used in the future .
 International Institute for Strategic Studies, 1972), 46; and CIA/DIA, “Cuba 1962,” 13 February 1964; . CIA-DIA: “The Cuban Revolution,’s first major conflict in Cuba, occurred in 1962 . CIA: ‘
 Kennedy characterized the increasingly strident calls for invasion of the island as irresponsible ‘loose talk’ that only encouraged Castro’s claims of American aggressive intentions . Under pressure from Congress, Kennedy described the calls as irresponsible .
 On 29 August, two weeks before Kennedy’s press conference, a U-2 reconnaissance plane provided the ªrst conclusive evidence that Soviet shortrange missiles were already deployed in Cuba .
 Two statements were prepared in connection with the Punta del Este conference in 1962 . The possibility was acknowledged in two statements prepared in January and February 1962 .
 Neither statement was used publicly, but a January version was released to a number of reporters in Washington . The January version of the January version has not been used publicly .
 The earliest physical evidence that the Soviet Union was sending SAMs to Cuba came from photography of Soviet ships in early August . SAMs were captured by Soviet ships .
 The photographs did not show actual SA-2 missiles, but they did reveal the types of construction and transport equipment associated with Soviet deployments of SAMs .
 McCone argued that the SAMs might be there to provide cover for something more important, perhaps MRBMs . McCone: "SAMs might provide cover ... for something else."
 Senator Keating claimed publicly that he had obtained reliable evidence of the presence of Soviet MRBMs in Cuba . Keating said he had been able to obtain reliable evidence .
 The existing armaments in Cuba are defensive in nature and therefore posed no serious threat to other countries in the region, experts say . Nevertheless, the consensus of ofªcial opinion through September and early October remained .
 Tipping point would be deployment of surface-to-surface missiles or nuclear warheads, says Bundy . The tipping point, agreed McGeorge Bundy and other senior advisers at a meeting on 4 September .
 The NIE deemed it unlikely that the Soviet Union would be so provocative as to cross the threshold from a defensive to an offensive buildup . The judgment proved famously off the mark .
 Unconmed reports of the presence of surface-to-surface cruise missiles had been circulating in the intelligence community since early August . Uncon’rmed reports were circulating in early August, intelligence officials say .
 The ªrst photographic conªrmation came from U.2 surveillance on 19 August and 5 September . The U.S. Air Force photo was the first to be taken by a U.N. aircraft .
 NPIC analysts identify a missile complex at the port of Banes on the eastern end of the island . They could not immediately determine the types of missiles . The complex is located in Banes .
 The president, McNamara, and Rusk were informed of this .nding on 6 September .
 Attempts to identify missiles still were unsuccessful . Over the next two weeks, attempts to identify the missiles still failed .
 The key ªgures in this exchange did not specify whether they were referring to long range or tactical surface-to-surface missiles .
 A consensus emerged within the intelligence community that the missiles observed at several coastal sites were cruise missiles with a range of 50 to 65 kilometers . The missiles were probably derived from the AS-1 Kennel-type air-tosurface anti-shipping missile armed with a 1,
 As of February 1963, they had pinpointed four operational sites, each with eight to ten missiles, at Siguanea, Santa Cruz del Norte, Banes, and Campo Florida . Each of the sites had an operational site with eight or ten missiles .
 The remaining missiles remained in crates at several locations throughout Cuba . The missiles were placed in crates in crates throughout the country .
 U.S. analysts estimated that the Soviet Union planned to deploy the remaining coastal defense missiles at up to another ªfteen sites . The Soviet Union also planned to use up to 15 sites .
 U.S. intelligence counted the total number of cruise missiles in Cuba fairly accurately but failed to recognize that the missiles were of two different types . With the beneªt of hindsight (and, more importantly, information from former Soviet sources) it now appears that United States intelligence counted
 The weapons photographed at the four operational sites were the Sopka missiles, it appears . The other missiles, initially observed in crates, were the FKRs, the U.S. says .
 It is now known that 80 nuclear warheads were in Cuba at the time . U.S. analysts never fully realized that nuclear-capable cruise missiles were there . The failure to identify the types of missiles accurately was partly to blame .
 Under Secretary of State George Ball was the ªrst to disclose outside the administration the news that surface-to-surface cruise missiles were present in Cuba . Ball told a congressional committee on 3 October that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected three to four coastal defense missile sites and
 In January 1965, U.S. intelligence analysts first recognized surface-to-surface cruise missiles were present in Cuba . The missiles were discovered in January 1965 .
 During a military parade in Havana on 2 January 1965, the Cubans paraded three cruise missiles . The missiles were slightly different from the usual Kennel variant .
 The parade announcer identiªed them as new “land-to-land missiles,” but U.S. intelligence struggled to identify them positively .
 See “Current Intelligence Digest,” 2 January 1965, Country, Cuba, Intelligence Vol. 2, 1965, on Cuba .
 His statement was regarded as routine at the time, but after the crisis it became controversial . It became controversial in the bitter political struggle to untangle what the administration knew .
 The discovery of MRBMs in Cuba escalated tensions markedly and injected a new sense of urgency into the debate over the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons .
 Khrushchev adopted the formulation “the weapons you call offensive” when addressing the issue . Throughout the ensuing crisis and its aftermath, Soviet ofªcials persistently denied that the MRBMs were offensive weapons .
 Soviet doctrine used the terms “tactical” and “strategic” differently from the way they were used by Western governments . Soviet military doctrine used “military doctrine’s” different from the terms used by the West .
 The Soviet Union emphasized the role of the weapons, whereas Western military planners stressed technical capabilities such as range and explosive yield . The Soviet U.S. emphasized the importance of weapons, while Western strategists stressed range and yield .
 The discovery of MRBMs in Cuba crossed the threshold from defensive to offensive as Kennedy had deªned them in his statement on 13 September . Regardless, as far as Washington was concerned, the discovery of the MRB Ms. in Cuba crosses the threshold of offensive .
 MRBMs had a range of nearly 1,800 kilometers and could reach Washington, DC, and about half of the continental U.S. within minutes of launch .
 The construction of bases for intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of 4,000 kilometers indicated that those missiles were on their way . None actually arrived, although none actually arrived .
 In early February 1963, this earlier brieªng was revived by members of the Mahon committee, particularly Representative Liscomb, when they suspected serious discrepancies between Ball’s testimony and McCone's . Ball's testimony was re-examined in February 1963 .
 Up to that point, no ofªcial mention had been made of the Lunas . The Lunas are a weapon notable primarily as a tactical nuclear weapon .
 A CIA document distributed to senior policymakers on 19 October warned that refugee reports indicated that Luna rockets were in Cuba . NPIC analysts scouring the high-altitude photography initially could not find any evidence to back up that claim .
 U.S. analysts could view greater detail of smaller patches of territory . The first waves of low-level surveillance began on 23 October .
 A .ight on 25 October photographed a Luna launcher at a large camp at Remedios, a site in central Cuba being prepped to receive IRBMs . A Luna launcher is being used to launch missiles into Cuba .
 The original plans for possible military action against Cuba did not envisage the use of nuclear weapons . The original plan for possible war against Cuba was not envisaged using nuclear arms .
 U.S. troops could confront tactical nuclear weapons if the president ordered an invasion, author says .
 Members of the Berlin Ambassadorial Group were given a brieªng on 29 October that covered the Frog missiles .
 These weapons would be used only in retaliation for the employment of nuclear weapons against U.S. forces . The weapons would only be used in retaliation .
 Joint Chiefs and McNamara authorized only part of Dennison’s request, allowing him to equip the invasion force with nuclear-capable delivery systems such as Honest John missiles and eight-inch howitzers . The Joint Chiefs agreed to modify his plans accordingly, but the Joint
 They did not authorize him to include nuclear warheads without explicit JCS approval . JCS did not approve of the use of nuclear warheads .
 Honest John rockets were deployed to Florida without their nuclear warheads . Nike-Hercules nuclear surface-to-air missiles were also sent to Florida . Honest John missiles were deployed without warheads .
 Some sources indicate that Pershing missiles were sent to Key West with nuclear warheads . Hard evidence to support this claim remains elusive .
 No documentary evidence has come to light explaining the thinking behind the decision to withhold authority to use nuclear weapons . The U.S. has not been able to find out why the decision was made .
 Available documents from the period record the decision without the rationale . Available documents show the decision was made without a rationale .
 If a record of this meeting ever existed, it probably was destroyed in August 1974 . The meeting was likely to have been held in 1974 .
 The prevailing rules of engagement for air defense for Florida stated explicitly that nuclear weapons would not be used . The rules were issued by the air defense of Florida .
 CINCLANT planners tried to reduce reaction times and increase the numbers of troops in order to reduce the vulnerability of the invading force to Soviet tactical nuclear weapons . To compensate for the increased reaction times, planners tried .
 By 10 November, U.S. surveillance had counted 33 MRBM transporters on eight ships heading back to the Soviet Union . The Kennedy administration decided to take Soviet leaders at their word that they had deployed a total of 42 MRBMs in Cuba and that all the missiles had
 The focus shifted to other Soviet weapons based in Cuba and whether the administration should push for the status quo ante or accept some of the military buildup . The focus of the debate shifted to whether the U.S. military buildup should be pushed back .
 The early shipments leaving Cuba did not include V-75s, cruise missiles, Lunas, or Il-28s . Early shipments left Cuba in the early 1950s did not have cruise missiles .
 The letters between Kennedy and Khrushchev during the crisis had often been vague and not always consistent about the types of weapons covered . The letters were often vague and sometimes inconsistent about the type of weapon covered .
 In the letters to Khrushchev, Kennedy returned to the “offensive/defensive” dichotomy . Kennedy repeatedly demanded that the Soviet Union remove its ‘offensive” weapons from Cuba .
 Khrushchev, for his part, repeatedly disputed that label even for the long-range missiles and bombers . He said that even for his long range missiles, bombers, he didn't want to use that label .
 Desch, ‘‘That Deep Mud in Cuba,’” 333; and JCS, “Chronology of JCS Decisions Concerning the Cuban Crisis,” 65. Desch . Desch: ‘That deep mud in Cuba�
 U.S. intelligence analysts had photographic conªrmation of only 33 MRBMs in Cuba . Soviet and Cuban ofªcials said that 42 MRBMMs had been in Cuba and that all of them had been removed .
 Soviet forces in Cuba continued uncrating Il-28 bombers, constructing barracks for combat regiments, continuing work on cruise missile sites . Afterward, Soviet forces showed signs they were still planning to establish submarine bases in Cuba .

 President Kennedy ultimately settled for less than what he had set out in his 23 October proclamation . President Kennedy had to settle for a lower amount of money .
 U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Adlai Stevenson handed to Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan a list of weapons to be removed . Stevenson handed the list to Soviet deputy premier Mikoyans .
 The JCS had played an inºuential role in devising the list, which reºected the Chiefs’ maximal approach .
 Revising the list forced U.S. policymakers to think carefully about what they considered a real threat and what they could tolerate if needed .
 Kennedy and his aides sensed that if they pushed too hard, they might push Khrushchev beyond the breaking point, alienate their allies, and reignite the crisis . Kennedy's aides sensed if they push too hard might push them beyond breaking point and alienate allies .
 They worried that if they were too cautious, they would end up with an unnecessary threat in the Caribbean and all the military and political consequences it would entail . But they also worried they would be too cautious . They also worried if they ended up with a unnecessary threat .
 They have not yet reached a consensus about the weapons that fell into each category . But they had not yet agreed on the weapons categories .
 No one in Washington questioned that MRBMs and IRBMs fell squarely within the “offensive” category . But views about other kinds of weapons were more divergent .
 The Il-28s, for example, were the subject of extensive internal debate . They were subject to extensive internal debates .
 The president was reluctant to let the settlement get “hung up” on the bombers . McNamara had to be convinced by several of his senior advisers that the IL-28s are part of the deal .
 What was deliberately omitted from the revised list was as signiªcant as what was included . What was omitted was as much of what was omitted as what had been .
 Short-range surface-to-surface missiles fell within a gray area in threat assessments . The short-range missiles were found to be within a "gray area" of threat assessments, officials say .
 The weapons could not reach United States territory but could be used against U.S. forces at Guantánamo or United States forces that might be ordered to invade .
 The primary concern was that if the Soviet Union continued to strengthen its garrison in Cuba with SAMs, Lunas, and other ground weaponry, the deployments would provide cover for the rapid reintroduction of strategic weapons . The Soviet Union was concerned that the deployment of SAMs and Lunas would
 Fears also abounded that warheads could be delivered even more quickly by submarine or by air . Fears were also raised that warheads may be delivered more quickly .
 Some ofªcials were concerned that allowing any nuclear-capable forces to stay in Cuba would set a bad precedent and create political problems .
 The White House statement of 4 September implicitly accepted that short-range missile systems were all defensive weapons systems . SAMs, Komar torpedo boats, and MiGs were all identified as a defensive weapons system .
 Under Secretary of State Alexis Johnson and Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze raised the issue of whether the Lunas/Frogs should be included on the list .
 United States ofªcials debated whether the Soviet Union could reintroduce nuclear warheads into Cuba quickly and secretly . U.S. debated whether it could be used to bring in nuclear warheads in Cuba .
 One possibility they considered was that Soviet submarines might deliver the warheads . One possibility was that they might be delivered by submarines .
 Soviet airline Aeroºot began regular weekly civilian service from Moscow to Havana via Murmansk on 7 January 1963 .
 President Kennedy was closely following the issue of remaining ground forces and accepted the logic . President Kennedy did not participate directly in that exchange, but evidence strongly suggests that he was following closely .
 The Soviet Union would have little incentive to remove the remaining troops unless the U.S. offered a formal UN-supervised guarantee that it would not invade Cuba . The United States would have to provide a formal guarantee to the Soviet Union .
 CIA official: Short-range missiles would not be deªned as offensive . NATO allies pressed him on whether the missiles would be offensive . The missiles could be used in the U.S. military, he says .
 Cleveland’s handwritten note on draft draft: He conveyed the message by telephone . According to the note, he conveyed the draft order by phone . The draft is a free agent for the Cleveland Cavaliers .
 My feeling would be that we would be better off to have those units in and not have the guarantee . My feeling is that we should not have a guarantee .
 McNamara pointed out that “they have patrol craft missiles, the missiles on the Komars.” McNamara said . McNamara also said that the U.S. has “policits craft missiles” on Komars .
 The main concern was not about the military implications of those missiles, but about the lack of public understanding that the missiles were not strategic threats . Interestingly, the main concern is that the public is not aware of the risks .
 The administration faced tensions between diplomatic expediency, military imperatives and domestic politics . Having made that decision, the administration had to defend it on several fronts .
 The JCS remained uncomfortable about the prospect that Soviet troops and their Lunas would remain in Cuba . The Soviet Union troops and Lunas remained in Cuba in the 1950s .
 The Joint Chiefs did not deny that such short-range weapons were primarily defensive forces . The Chiefs were 83 years old .
 The ofªcial memorandum of this conversation recorded that “the Russians won’t take out their ground forces’s ground forces until we give a no-invasion assurance.”
 The JCS continued to plan for this contingency . The U.S. military buildup that accompanied these plans reached a maximum state of readiness on 15 November .
 The JCS also had to provide for the defense of the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo . The base is located in Guantanamo Bay .
 Short-range missiles hidden in the mountains near Guantánamo and pointed at the base had attracted the Joint Chiefs’ attention . The Joint Chiefs' attention was focused on the missiles .
 They raised the issue when they met with the president from November 1962 to February 1963, arguing that the weapons were a threat to Guantánamo and posed a risk that the Cubans could export them to Communist subversives .
 The JCS persistently called for the resumption of lowlevel surveillance . To gather more information about the weapons that were still in Cuba, the JCS called for lowlevel . surveillance to be resumed .
 No good options were available if another U-2 were shot down over Cuba . The U.2 was shot down in Cuba in the early 1990s .
 The request to resume low-level surveillance was denied . The request was therefore denied by the US government .
 Underlying all this discussion was the inevitable uncertainty about the presence of nuclear warheads . Underlying the discussion was uncertainty about whether nuclear warheads are there .
 The Soviet Union had offered assurances that all nuclear warheads had been removed well before they actually were . Soviet Union offered assurances well before it actually was removed .
 Khrushchev assured the British ambassador to the Soviet Union that all nuclear warheads were gone from Cuba . The Soviet leader assured Sir Frank Roberts that the warheads had been removed .
 The tactical nuclear warheads did not actually leave Cuba until the following month . They were left behind by the U.S. in Cuba .
 Soviet commander in Cuba, Army-General Issa Pliev, did not receive orders to return all of the warheads until 20 November . In fact, the Soviet commander of Cuba in Cuba did not get orders to hand over the warheads .
 The decision not to leave any tactical warheads in Cuba was a policy reversal . The decision to leave no tactical warheads was a decision to make a policy change .
 The available evidence from Russian archives suggests that the plan had originally been to hand over the Luna rockets to the Cubans . Russian archives suggest that the original plan was to hand the rockets over to the Cuban government .
 Such a move would have been in keeping with the recent policy of supplying Warsaw Pact countries with tactical weapon carriers and launchers . Such a step would have kept the policy in keeping .
 The Soviet Union was providing launchers and missiles to the East European countries . It was keeping the warheads under tight Soviet control .
 In times of heightened alert, special Soviet commando units delivered warheads to missiles and supervise their deployment and use . Commando units would deliver warheads to the missiles .
 The Soviet Defense Ministry had apparently been operating under the assumption that the Lunas and other battleªeld weapons would be handed over to the Cubans . The Lunas were among the weapons seized from the Soviet government .
 In early November, Soviet Defense Minister Rodion Malinovksii informed General Pliev in Havana that the Lunas and coastal defense missiles with conventional payloads would likely remain in Cuba . No decision on the nuclear warheads for these weapons had been made .
 The factor that apparently changed Khrushchev's mind was Castro’s seemingly erratic behavior in late October through mid-November, he said . Castro's erratic behavior was apparently to blame for the change .
 Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to reason with Castro and encourage him to relax his hard line on the settlement of the crisis . Khrushchevitch had dispatched the Soviet Union leader to Havana .
 Khrushchev’s unilateral decision to withdraw the missiles had infuriated the Cuban leader . The decision was made to withdraw missiles from the Soviet Union in 1962 .
 Fursenko and Naftali, Khrushchev’s Cold War, co-wrote ‘One Hell of a Gamble’; ‘Krushchev's Cold War’, ‘Naftali’ and ‘Fursenko & Naft
 Mikoyan had tried to reassure the Cuban leader that Moscow would provide the means for Cuba to defend itself but would not embark on nuclear war with the United States .
 Cubans remain hopeful that island’s defense still included a nuclear dimension . Unaware of this order, Cubans remained hopeful that the island still had nuclear weapons .

 Those transporters were apparently loaded onto the Kislovodsk and shipped to the USSR on 5 January . The transporter was apparently loaded into the plane .
 After this shipment, U.S. intelligence continued to observe Luna transporters and launchers at Soviet encampments in Cuba .
 The diplomatic settlement of the crisis played out against a backdrop of intense partisanship in domestic politics .
 Several Republicans had anticipated using the Cuba issue to attack the Democrats and the administration in the lead-up to the 1962 midterm election .
 The Cuba issue seems to have had little impact on how people actually voted . Republican hawks felt they had been cheated at the eleventh hour .
 As a result, they resumed their attacks in November 1962 and kept up the campaign for the next several months .
 The administration was under pressure from congressional critics, the press, and Cuban émigrés agitating for a U.S. invasion of Cuba to oust Castro . The administration had been under fire from members of Congress .
 From November 1962 through February 1963, Cuba was one of the thorniest issues confronting the administration . Cuba was a thorny issue for the administration from 1962 to 1963 .
 Cuban émigré groups in Miami spread rumors that the Soviet Union had sent at least 80 long-range missiles to Cuba . Khrushchev had claimed 42 missiles, not the 42 he claimed and the administration had accepted .
 The notion that Soviet ofªcials were unlikely to lie about the number of missiles they had sent and the number they had removed was not at all convincing . The administration had trumpeted for its own purposes .
 U.S. had no strong evidence of either the presence or absence of nuclear warheads in Cuba, Higgins said . The presence of such missiles is taken to indicate that the warheads that give them their punch, she said .

 At the time, the report was overshadowed by Kennedy’s press conference announcing the Soviet agreement to withdraw the Il-28s and lifting of the United States naval quarantine .
 Even after the deal of 20 November, Kennedy continued to face domestic political criticism, which built through January and early February 1963 . Kennedy faced domestic criticism of the deal, which began in November .
 Kennedy regained the initiative by authorizing a publicity campaign that included the disclosure of an unprecedented amount of detailed intelligence . Amid partisan attacks and internal disagreements that threatened to spill out into the open .
 This campaign was ultimately successful in silencing the critics and rescuing the generally favorable impression of Kennedy’s leadership that many people retained after the missile crisis . This campaign ultimately silenced critics .
 The president’s own performance during the crisis resonated well with the American public . President Obama's performance in the crisis was well-received by the U.S. public .
 A Gallup poll in the wake of the crisis showed Kennedy’s approval rating at 74 percent . A Gallup Poll in the aftermath of the incident showed Kennedy's approval rating .
 The surprise outbreak of the crisis was widely seen as the result of a devastating intelligence failure . But the surprise outbreak was widely thought to have been the result .
 Many commentators questioned the competence of U.S. intelligence agencies and of the Kennedy administration . After the Bay of Pigs, the CIA was accused of being incompetent in the wake of the attack .
 Additional reports of arms shipments to Cuba and round-the-clock work at Cuban military sites are unsettling . Additional reports about new and unidentiªed arms shipments were unsettling .
 Administration could not answer simple questions as to how many Soviet troops had been in Cuba at the height of the crisis and how many remained .
 The number of Soviet troops in Cuba peaked at around 17,000 during the crisis . The controversy became politically charged .
 Polls indicated that Cuba was Kennedy’s most vulnerable point on foreign policy . Republicans had hoped to exploit that in the run-up to the November 1962 midterm elections .
 Estimates retroactively judged that some 22,000 Soviet troops had been in Cuba during the crisis . Post-crisis estimates retroactively said that 22,00 Soviet troops were in Cuba .

 The Kennedy administration generally stuck to a tight ofªcial script, which was notably candid about the forces remaining on the island . Kennedy administration was generally candid .
 Critics have accused the administration of being too soft on Cuba . The administration has been accused of being soft on the island nation .
 Keating and others accused the administration of negligence in reducing aerial surveillance in September and early October . They alleged that the White House had deliberately created its own “October surprise” to steal the 6 November election .
 Soviet combat troops in Cuba were revealed to be more tightly organized, more numerous, and better armed than had previously been recognized . The Soviet forces were more organized and more numerous than had been previously recognized .
 Four Cuban missile bases were stationed near former strategic missile bases . One was near the site of an important Il-28 and 115 . The other was near a former missile base .

 The Stennis Committee identified this late identiªcation of the Soviet ground combat forces as an intelligence intelligence intelligence . The committee later concluded that this was an intelligence operation .
 The signiªcance of this last item was not lost on intelligence analysts . Intelligence analysts say it was not a surprise that the U.S. government has not been able to find out what happened .
 Analysts concluded that the original mission of these forces was to provide local ground defense against either a U.S. invasion or Cuban sabotage .
 Even as the MRBM and IRBM sites were being bulldozed, the construction of barracks suggested that Soviet leaders had no intention of withdrawing those troops . On a number of occasions through January and February, United States ofªcials testified before congressional committees .
 They drew analogies between Lunas/Frogs and Honest John missiles . They referred to the Soviet armaments as “advanced-type tactical rocket launchers, anti-personnel weapons .
 This assessment continued through the 1960s based on such evidence as the arrival in Cuba of some wives of Soviet personnel . This assessment was based on the arrival of wives of some Soviet personnel in Cuba .
 Committee members focused on the possible presence of long-range strategic missiles in Cuba and the arming of MiG-21s with nuclear weapons . Committee members focus on the possibility of a less likely but more sensational scenario .
 McCone had been warning since September that the Soviet Union might be installing MRBMs in Cuba . Word had leaked out that McCone, a Republican, was warning .
 Congressional Republicans jumped on apparent inconsistencies between what McCone was saying and what other members of the administration with more dovish reputations .
 Kennedy and the ExComm decided to end the speculation once and for all . Kennedy: "We are happy to put the speculation to an end" Kennedy: 'I am happy to see the end'
 President Kennedy endorsed McNamara’s proposal for greater transparency by laying out in a public brieªng what had been withdrawn from Cuba and what was still there .
 By highlighting the MiG-21s and the armored battalions with their Luna missiles, the brieªng could blur in the public mind the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons .
 McNamara staged an elaborate, nationally televised special on Cuba from the State Department’s auditorium . Despite this risk, McNamara went ahead with the plan on 6 February .

 Even the so-called defensive forces remaining could be a menace by enabling the Soviet Union to bring in offensive weapons furtively .
 Each legislator stressed, however, that he was not advocating direct military action .
 Keating’s pre-crisis charges that the White House had adopted a ‘look-the-other-way’ policy’ regarding the Soviet military buildup in Cuba . The administration faced two political challenges .
 The ªrst was to explain the apparent inconsistencies between the public statements of McNamara and McCone . McNamara was the president of the White House from 1968 to 1998 .
 One of the key points of contention was the signiªcance of the remaining Soviet ground forces . The Soviet withdrawal of ground forces was a key point of contention .

 To assuage Keating, McCone agreed to meet with the senator so that Keating would have the opportunity to convey the information he claimed to have . McCone: "I'm sorry for what I've done, but I'm not sure what happened"
 When they met, Keating insisted that more missiles and troops remained in Cuba than the administration had acknowledged . Keating said more missiles, troops remain in Cuba .
 Keating also told McCone that nuclear warheads for Lunas were being hidden in caves, a charge that government experts rebutted by pointing out that such an arrangement would be ‘unduly hazardous and inconvenient”
 Despite Congressman Selden’s efforts to keep the Cuba debate alive, Congress generally moved on to other issues . Despite efforts to hold hearings on the Cuba issue, Congress has largely moved on .
 U.S. intelligence had conªrmed through radio intercepts that a shipment containing a small amount of radioactive isotopes had arrived in Cuba in mid-January .
 U.S. intelligence ofªcials did not know for sure that the Soviet Union had delivered nuclear warheads, but never argued that they had not delivered them .
 U.S. policymakers did know, as of 26 October, that in addition to the MRBMs, the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear-capable battleªeld rockets in Cuba .
 The controversy in recent years over whether the Lunas were a known risk of the Cuban missile crisis implies in part that the U.S. intelligence community failed to detect the tactical nuclear missiles .
 The CIA underestimated by about half the number of Soviet troops in Cuba . The agency detected only 33 of the 42 MRBMs in Cuba, the agency says .
 The much-contested “photo gap” in the fall of 1962 was more a political failure than an intelligence failure . The limits on photographic surveillance that might have detected the long-range missiles sooner might have been detected sooner . Moreover, the photo gap was more of a political
 Intelligence reporting on the tactical nuclear weapons proved relatively accurate within the known and acknowledged technical limits of the time .
 U.S. intelligence ofªcials openly acknowledged that they could not prove one way or the other whether nuclear warheads were present in Cuba .
 "This admission did not signal a failure of diligence or imagination," the government said . "The existing technical capabilities did not permit certainty on this matter," the official said .
 Faced with that uncertainty, policymakers, analysts, and military planners assumed that nuclear warheads were in Cuba . The Cuban government was forced to assume that the warheads were there .
 Policymakers accepted, internalized, and applied this principle to more than just the MRBMs . Policymakers have applied it to other parts of the U.S. government .
 We were intrigued by the fact that we never found a nose cone in Cuba . Never found an identiªable nuclear weapon in Cuba.
 We have to assume that they were there, but they are not too difªcult to conceal, maybe . Maybe six feet long, maybe ªve or six foot long .
 It is possible that the quarantine intercepted the later shipments of this total effort, and that this might have included the nose cones, but we just don’t know . The nose cones may have included nose cones .
 Rusk told the same committee that he could not say whether nuclear warheads were still in Cuba . The following week, Rusk said he couldn't say for sure whether warheads were in the country . We never found them .
 McNamara provided even more detail and partly contradicted Rusk’s statements in his 6 February 1963 televised televised brieªng.
 "We traced the shipment of those vehicles on ships on ships back into the home waters of the So149. I believe we observed it in certain vehicles and we observed the movement of . those vehicles out of Cuba, and we traced those vehicles onto ships . The So149 was launched in

 Few other ofªcials during or after the crisis were willing to say whether warheads had been in Cuba . Almost no one was willing to discuss the sources and methods of intelligence gathering in such terms .
 The intelligence basis for McNamara’s statement (assuming it is accurate) remains unclear . McNamara's intelligence basis is unclear .
 CIA had an accurate understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the Lunas . Unlike with coastal defense missiles, U.S. analysts never accurately identiªed them .
 U.S. knew that the Lunas, MiG-21s, and V-75s they had seen in Cuba were capable of delivering nuclear warheads . United States ofªcials knew that . they had . seen that the . Lunas and MiGs they had
 Analysts and policymakers all believed it was highly unlikely that the MiG-21s and SA-2s would be used for nuclear delivery . But analysts and policymakers said it was unlikely they would use them for a nuclear weapon .
 The Frogs in Cuba could be armed with nuclear warheads, the U.S. ofªcials never did . Given numerous opportunities to contest the claim, the United States of cials never did .
 Senior ofªcials described Lunas as akin to the U.S. Army’s Honest John, a missile known primarily as a tactical nuclear weapon .
 The available evidence shows that in only one instance did the U.S. ofªcial categorically state that the Lunas in Cuba were not armed with nuclear warheads, and his assessment was "awed"
 A memorandum dated 29 October 1962 addressed to George Ball and signed by U Alexis Johnson but drafted by Raymond Garthoff discussed the coastal defense missiles, the Lunas, and the Komar torpedo boats . The Lunas were discussed in the memo .
 The U.S. should drop the use of the three weapons systems from Cuba . The United States should also drop the demand for these weapons systems to be removed from Cuba.
 Lunas were so inaccurate that they had little utility as conventional weapons in combat . Lunas are so accurate that they were used as weapons in the U.S. military .
 Because they followed an unguided ballistic trajectory and lacked in-ºight targeting capabilities, they could not be relied on to hit a speciªc target . Because they were not equipped with precision precision, they would not be able to hit speci‪c targets .
 Missile accuracy is measured in terms of Circular Error Probable . A circle centered on a target is centered on the target in which 50 percent of the missiles are expected to land .
 With the relatively small blast zone of a conventional high explosive warhead, measured in tens of meters at most, this inaccuracy rendered Lunas of little value as conventional weapons . Lunas have a relatively low blast zone, measuring only tens of metres at most .
 They proved to be so effective when used with non-nuclear warheads in later conºicts . Indeed, they proved so when used in later missions, they were .
 If equipped with nuclear warheads, they would pose a severe hazard to any invasion force . But if equipped with nukes, they could pose a serious threat to any invading force .
 For a description of the effects of a Luna rocket armed with a nuclear warhead, see Fursenko and Naftali, “One Hell of a Gamble,” p.2 .
 The extent of what has been called the “nuclear romanticism” of Soviet military planning was not fully documented until decades later . Soviet military ofªcers had made no secret of their increasing emphasis on nuclear forces in their war planning .
 The Lunas introduced a battleªeld nuclear capability to ground forces, thereby . thereby .lling a gap between long-range strategic missiles and traditional battle . artillery forces . Like the United States Army’s Honest John rockets, with which the Lunas were so often compared
 President Kennedy, Marine Commandant David Shoup, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George Anderson secretly recorded by Kennedy’s White House recording system in October 1962 . Their strengths could be most effective against concentrations of troops on the move .
 If nuclear weapons start down there, I’d say we’re at nuclear couldn’t afford to let them do that, he says .
 "Everybody sort of ªgures that, in extremis, that everybody would use nuclear weapons," he says . "But my guess is, well, everybody sort of . sort of ... that everybody . would use nukes," he adds .

 Operation Anadyr began in May 1962 and was completed on 30 September 1962 . United States intelligence at the time did not know that the Lunas delivered to the Warsaw Pact were deployed with Soviet forces in the German Democratic Republic .
 During the Cuban missile crisis, tactical nuclear missiles in East Germany apparently were placed on alert . East Germany was in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis .
 See Uhl, “Storming On to Paris,” 61, for more on nuclear warhead delivery systems .
 The risk of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis is inherently difªcult to measure . Conclusion: The risk is inherently difficult to measure. The risk was the risk of a nuclear war .
 Controversy about presence of tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba in October 1962 convinced some that a crisis already widely regarded as the most perilous moment of the Cold War was even more dangerous than imagined .
 When President Kennedy and his advisers were contemplating military action against Cuba, they did so without knowing that Soviet tactical nuclear weapons were present in Cuba .
 The direct threat posed by tactical nuclear missiles was far less than that posed by the MRBMs and IRBMs, which could strike targets in the continental United States . Unlike the tactical weapons, they could strike U.S. continental targets .
 The real risk was that any use of tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba could have led to uncontrollable escalation culminating in global thermonuclear war . Any use of Cuban nuclear weapons could've led to global war, says author .
 Soviet tactical nuclear weapons were not on hairtrigger alert during the missile crisis . General Gribkov’s initial remarks were met with hyperbolic claims that followed .
 Soviet command-and-control procedures had broken down or had been altered by leaders in Moscow . Nor could they have been put on alert at any subsequent stage unless they had been changed .
 No hard evidence has come to light indicating whether the tactical nuclear missiles had a deterrent effect on President Kennedy . President Kennedy was killed by a nuclear missile strike .
 The available evidence suggests that the detection of Luna deployments in Cuba did not fundamentally change the advice the president received from the president .
 Kennedy told some of his senior advisers at a December 1962 defense budget discussion that “what they had in Cuba alone would have been a substantial deterrent to me” A remarkable confession for a Cold War president to make even in private .
 Kennedy was neither oblivious nor cavalier when it came to the risks of tactical nuclear weapons . Kennedy did not subscribe to the view expressed by Dwight Eisenhower almost a decade earlier . Eisenhower had said that the bomb should be regarded as just another weapon .

 The record suggests that after 28 October his policy was driven by his effort to deºate the pressure from the political right and his more hawkish advisers, who insisted that he take a harder line, while pushing ahead with his own desire to forge an accommodation with Khrushchev .
 Jimmy Carter's successor, Jimmy Carter, paid such a price in the early years of his presidency . Jimmy Carter died in 1977 at age of 65 . He was assassinated by President Richard Nixon in 1979 .
 After the early 1960s, the remaining Soviet troops had disappeared from public view . The remaining Soviet forces disappeared from view .
 About 2,600 Soviet combat troops were found in Cuba in 1979 . They reappeared in October 1979 when news broke that the CIA had "discovered" in Cuba .
 This disclosure by Senator Frank Church created a political .restorm for the Carter administration . Church was a Democrat involved in a tough reelection .
 Bundy wrote that after the “offensive weapons” were removed, the ongoing presence of Soviet troops in Cuba ceased to be a priority for the administration and the intelligence community . Bundy: After the "offensive weapons" were removed from Cuba, the continued presence of the Soviet troops ceased to
 The Kennedy and Johnson administrations had known about the remaining Soviet ground forces, debated the nature of the risk, and decided that a few thousand Soviet troops in Cuba posed no meaningful threat to the United States or other countries in the region .
 Bundy also pointed out that the focus of the Kennedy administration’s deliberations was naturally on “offensive” weapons . Bundy: The focus of Kennedy's deliberations on ‘offensive’ weapons was naturally . Bundy also said the focus was on "offensive" weapons .
