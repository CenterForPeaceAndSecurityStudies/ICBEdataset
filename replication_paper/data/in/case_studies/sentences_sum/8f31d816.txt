 Study in Non-Linguistic Symbolic Interaction uses Goffman’s distinction between expressions 'given' and ‘given off’ to advance the study of how nuclear bombs and military maneuvers create meaning .
 The analysis reveals that actions do indeed sometimes speak louder than words . The analysis shows that actions sometimes speak more often than words.
 World opinion is often a semi-visible thirdparty, such as world opinion . Who is being spoken to is often an anonymous thirdparty .
 The analysis identifies a novel process of ‘staging the other’ - when one side tries to create a situation which will force the other side to act in a way which will create a negative impression on world opinion .
 In so far as the staging is not perceived by the audience and the target does indeed make themselves look bad, then staging is a particularly powerful form of impression management . Staging is a powerful way to manage impression management, says Simon Cowell .
 On October 30th 1961, the USSR, led by Nikita Khrushchev, detonated the largest and most powerful nuclear bomb in history over an uninhabited region within the Arctic Circle .
 We are not going to explode it, because even if we did so at the most remote site, we might knock out all our windows . But we are not . going to . explode it . Even if we . did so, even if . we did . do so at . the
 We are therefore going to hold off for the time being and not set off, not set the bomb off . We will therefore go into a state of mourning for the first time .
 May God grant, as they used to say, that we are never called upon to explode these bombs over anybody’s territory .
 The explosion was a communicative dramatization of power . It succeeded in creating an impression of awe and fear around the globe . The explosion created an impression .
 The present manuscript examines posturing with nuclear weapons as a form of communication . It examines the use of nuclear weapons to communicate .
 Linell has argued that there is a ‘written language bias,’ that communication, even spoken communication, is studied from a written point of view .
 People do things with words, but, people also communicate by doing things . People communicate with words but also communicate with other things .
 Much of this literature remains at the inter-personal level . However, like the work on non-verbal communication, much of this work is still at the personal level .
 ‘The language bias,’ beyond symbolic interactionist research, is the work by Schelling . One notable exception to ‘the language bias’ is Schelling’s work on the language bias .
 Schelling has observed that although nuclear weapons have not been used in violence since 1945, they have been very communicative in international relations . Schelling says nuclear weapons are communicative and useful in international diplomacy .
 Schelling argues that arms control is not maintained by signatures, but, maintained by actions and self-interests . Equally, in the context of a limited war fought by superpowers, Schelling argued .
 A good reason for not bombing the enemy's civilians is to prevent them from bombing one’s own civilians . For example, a good reason should be to prevent the enemy from bombing your own civilians, says John Defterios .
 The present article utilizes a symbolic interactionist approach to advance our understanding of non-linguistic communication at the inter-group level . It is the result of an interactionist-interactionist approach using symbolic interactionism .
 The analysis underscores the importance of non-linguistic communication and introduces the concept of ‘staging the other,’ which occurs when one party tries to create a situation which will force the action of the other party in relation to world opinion .
 George Herbert Mead proposed that communication, or symbolic activity, begins with the response of a second organism . Mead: Communication begins with an organism responding to a second response .
 The second organism learns to ‘read’ observed actions as indexing future actions . If the actions of the first organism are of consequence for the second organism, the second organisms learn to 'read' observed actions . The first organism learned to read the observed actions and index them to
 The first involves verbal symbols or their substitutes which he uses admittedly and solely to convey the information that he and others are known to attach to these symbols . The first is a verbal symbol or their substitute .
 Second involves a wide range of action that others can treat as symptomatic of the actor . The expectation is that the action was performed for reasons other than the information conveyed in this way .
 A guest exclaims “your cooking is wonderful” is ‘giving’ an expression . A guest exclaimed ‘your cooking’s wonderful’ is a way of expressing your cooking .
 The host is likely to pay more attention to the eagerness and gusto with which the guest eats . But, knowing that words are cheap, the host will likely pay more .
 The scenario is complicated by the fact that the guest is likely to be aware of the communicative significance of their eating behavior, and thus may ‘give off’ expressions of eagerness and gusto .
 This definition includes both intentional and unintentional communication . The definition of intentional communication is both unintentional and intentional communication .
 While it is somewhat unfashionable to consider intended meaning, I suggest that despite being risky, it does have analytic value . Despite being risky it does has analytic value, consider it as a useful tool for analysis .
 It acknowledges the plurality of the social world and allows us to conceptualize misunderstandings . Specifically it acknowledges plurality of social world .
 An unintended impression is meaning created in the mind of the other which the source did not intend . Unintended impression is . meaning created by the source of an unintended impression .
 Unintended impressions relate to the actors’ “blindspot” and thus the “surplus” meaning or “excess, meaning that any expression creates in its audience . Unintintended impression relates to the actor’s ‘blindspot
 The second concept, staging the other, is a novel contribution that expands the notion of impression management . The first concept is staged, staged, and the second concept is the idea of staging, staging .
 Traditional view of impression management as occurring within a dyadic relationship is giving way to a triadic model . The concept of ‘staging the other’ contributes to this development .
 Staging the other entails using actions or utterances to create a constraining situation for the other that forces them to act in such a way as to . create a negative impression on a third party . The other is trying to create the other's negative impression .
 Impression management concepts were developed to study inter-personal interactions . The following analysis uses them to analyze an inter-group interaction . The analysis uses the concepts to analyze a group interaction .
 In inter-group interaction, there are many layers of impression management . These levels are not equivalent; in face-to-face interaction individuals can be conceptualized as individually responsible for the impressions they seek to create .
 They comprise departments with disparate interests and histories, and within the departments, there are individuals, again with differential histories and interests . The departments are diverse and diverse, and individuals, with different interests .
 Inter-national impression management has many layers of impression management, it is nonetheless impression management . Nevertheless, as the following analysis aims to demonstrate, the analysis shows that impression management is not only impression management but impression management. It is still impression management in the world .
 First, the channels of linguistic communication between the White House and the Kremlin were very slow, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "The channels of language communication between Russia and the United States are very slow"
 During the Crisis messages were sent via ambassadors and could take a day or more . During the crisis messages could take days or more to send .
 The discussions are mainly between the members of ExComm, but they also include the President’s discussions with ExComm and other relevant people . They also include Intelligence Officials, Ambassadors, past Presidents, members of Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
 Anatoly Dobrynin’s report to Khrushchev of his meeting with Robert Kennedy is used because it provides the best available account of this critical meeting . The report is used to provide the best known account of the meeting .
 Khrushchev’s Memoirs are used in the analysis to provide some limited and speculative insight into Soviet thinking during the Crisis . Second, the analysis provides some limited but speculative insight on Soviet thinking in the 1950s .
 Analysis is a case study, and as such issues of sampling, frequency and representativeness are of limited importance . This material is included in an attempt to study the communication .
 The focus is on what actually occurred in this particular instance of nuclear brinkmanship . The focus should be on the fact that this was a nuclear incident .
 The analytic procedure entailed using the concepts and assumptions outlined above as interpretative tools to make visible impression management dynamics within the Crisis. The analytic process entailed .
 The validity of the analysis, however, cannot be determined on the basis of . methodological procedure . Rather it must be determined by the results of the . analysis in relation to alternative interpretations, rather than the results .
 The main finding was that ExComm were trying to force the Soviets to make moves which would create a negative impression in world opinion, emerged out of the analysis .
 All the data is public and accordingly it is fully open to refutation or re-interpretation . The validity of the analysis rests, in part, on the fact that all the data are public .
 President Kennedy and his advisors were surprised to learn, in mid-October 1962, that Soviet nuclear missiles were being installed in Cuba .
 ExComm knew that the USA had nuclear superiority, and, of course, missiles in Cuba did something to redress this imbalance . The U.S. knew that it had a nuclear superiority in Cuba .
 The USSR had alternatives they were developing, such as inter-continental missiles and nuclear submarines . However, it was seen to be very risky and the USSR had alternative missiles and submarines .
 Khrushchev demonstrated a sense of caution over Laos, Berlin, he’s been cautious . It's just as if we suddenly began to put a major number of MRBMs [Medium Range Ballistic Missiles] in Turkey .
 Kennedy urges advisors to ‘read’ the Soviet’s intentions, and future actions, from their military maneuver . Kennedy urges his advisors to 'read' the Soviet intentions from their maneuver .
 Kennedy imagines a reversal of positions, asking, under what conditions the USA would do something similar . Kennedy, attempting to understand the Soviet point of view, imagines the U.S. would do similar .
 The U.S. put MRBMs in Turkey, Italy and the UK when they believed they were weak . It turns out that the USA did do something similar; they did . The USA did .
 Khrushchev may feel that it’s important for us to learn about living under medium-range missiles . He may feel he has to balance that political, psychological flank .
 The maneuver, Rusk suggests, may be an attempt to make the fewer Soviet missiles make a bigger impression upon the U.S. populace . Rusk says the move may be a move to make fewer missiles appear more appealing to the public .
 West Berlin was controlled by the Allies, and the Soviet administration was concerned that it was spreading capitalist influence . The Soviet government was concerned about the influence of West Berlin .
 If they could provoke us into taking the first overt action, then the world would be confused and they would have what they would consider to be justification for making a move . If they were provoked, they would be able to provoke us to take action .
 Military representatives in ExComm viewed the Crisis as an opportunity for a military solution that would remove Fidel Castro from power . ExComm members viewed the crisis as a potential military solution to the Cuban crisis .
 According to this interpenetration, the missiles, rather than being defensive or even offensive, were actually meant to ‘invite’ an invasion . The missiles were meant to 'invite' an invasion, according to the intercommissioner .
 Wheeler argued that the USSR was not interested in a costly and logistically complex conflict in the Caribbean . Wheeler: The USSR did not want to engage in a logistically complicated conflict .
 The maneuver was a projection of Soviet strength towards Latin America in an attempt to support movements towards socialism . Rather, the maneuver was intended to support socialist movements in Latin America .
 The missiles were meant to be communicative, and they were not even addressing the USA, but rather third parties in Latin America . Thus the missiles were not addressed to the USA .
 President Kennedy’s response was to issue a public condemnation, demand that the missiles be removed, and order a naval blockade of Cuba . Khrushchev's letters to President Kennedy were published by the State Department .
 They were calculated to use utterance backed up with action to create an impression of resolve . They were used to create a impression of a resolve, they said .
 President Kennedy received a private letter from Chairman Khrushchev on the 26th of October . President Kennedy received a private letter of support from the Soviet Union .
 Khrushchev offered Kennedy a deal with the Soviet Union . Kennedy was the prime minister of Soviet Union's first term .
 He offered to withdraw the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a guarantee that the USA would not interfere in the sovereignty of Cuba . The deal was agreed in Cuba, Cuba's sovereignty .
 Before ExComm had a chance to fully consider the offer, a second letter arrived . However, before ExComm was fully considered, the offer was rescinded .
 A second letter from Khrushchev was released to the media containing a more hardline message . On the morning of 27th October, known as ‘Black Saturday’ , known as 'Black Saturday', was released .
 Khrushchev requested that the USA remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey . In addition to requesting a guarantee not to interfere with Cuba, the U.S. also requested a guarantee that the US would not interfere in Cuba .
 I understand your concern for the security of the U.S. You want to relieve your country from danger and this is understandable, says President Obama . I understand this, says CNN.com .
 Your rockets are stationed in Britain and in Italy and pointed at us, says Soviet Union . But how can we, the Soviet Union and our government, assess your actions? We ask .
 It lies at a distance of 90 miles across the sea from the shores of the United States .
 Goffman: Khrushchev’s letters were, in Goffman's sense, expressions given . Both of Khrushches' letters were given, Goffman says . Goffman said: ‘Both letters were expressions given. Both letters are expressions given'
 The first was sent privately but the second was released to the mass media . However, while the first was private, the second sent private messages to the media .
 Khrushchev accepted Kennedy’s concern with the security of the USA, and on the same principle, argues that Cuba and indeed any country must be allowed to have the same concern . The second letter begins with a letter of support for Cuba .
 It does not simply label the USA as being unfair, rather, it stages Kennedy . Kennedy stages Kennedy's appeal to collectively held norms, rather than simply say it is unfair .
 Kennedy's actions will determine whether, in the eyes of the world, the USA has double standards . It creates a situation within which Kennedy’s own actions will decide whether the U.S. has doubled standards .
 The explicit meaning of each of Khrushchev’s letters is quite clear . Escalation of the letters is also clear .
 The unintended impression made is quite different from the explicit meaning of the letters . However, because the two letters offer different deals, the messages are quite different . The two letters are different and offer different meanings .
 ExComm get more meaning out of the letters than is contained in either letter . What is communicating is the discrepancy between the letters . ExComm use the letters to communicate more meaning than the letters themselves .
 Schelling argues that freedom is a weakness in bargaining because it makes concession possible . Schelling says freedom is the weakness of bargaining, and it makes concessions possible .
 In contrast, demonstrable lack of freedom is strength in bargaining, because it forces the other to make concessions . "In contrast, a lack of free is strength," he says .
 The question is whether Khrushchev still has any freedom to maneuver . ExComm is asking whether the former Soviet Union leader can still maneuver in his own country .
 While ExComm were discussing the two letters, they received news that a U-2 surveillance plane had been shot down over Cuba resulting in the death of the pilot .
 During the course of the discussion it was confirmed that the shooting was done by a Russian SAM site . The shooting was carried out by an unidentified Russian SAM .
 This fact leads to the suggestion that the shooting was ‘not any accident’ , but a deliberate communication from the Kremlin designed to add emphasis to Khrushchev’s second hardline letter . The fact that the shootings was “not any accidental” suggests that the
 There is no evidence that the Soviet SAM site was ordered to shoot down the U-2 spy plane . The plane was shot down by Soviet forces in the early 1950s .
 The State Department had been asked to look into the implications of removing the Jupiter missiles from Turkey . The Jupiter missiles were removed from Turkey in 2010 .
 The missiles had serious upkeep costs and added little strategic advantage given the advent of Polaris missiles which could be launched from submarines . Polaris missiles were launched by submarines .
 The problem is that appearing weak might not only undermine the reputation of the USA, but it might embolden Khrushchev . The U.S. should not be seen as weak, it may embolden the Soviet Union, writes David Cameron .
 ExComm consider courses of action that would communicate strength, resolve and restraint . ExComm: "Cease of action would communicate a strength and resolve"
 SAM site which was accused of shooting down the U-2 plane is destroyed . One popular option is to destroy the SAM site . The SAM site is believed to have been used to shoot down the plane . SAM site was used in the shooting of the U.2 .
 U-2 boy going down. You just ask yourself what made the greatest impression on you today, whether it was his letter last night, or whether it's his letter this morning .
 Vice President Johnson: That's exactly right; that’s what did it. The U-2 boy was the U.2 boy . Vice president Johnson: "That's exactly what happened. That's what happened"
 Shooting, Johnson argues, speaks louder than words . "That’s when everybody started to change, and that is what is going to make an impression upon him," he says .
 In these decisions, the communicative function of the actions rises above their practical significance, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 That the response is swift is as important as the nature of the response itself . The act of responding is as communicative as the way it responds to a crisis .
 Goffman says impression management aims to control the conduct of others . Goffman: People engage in impression management to control others' conduct .
 ExComm are trying to create an impression of strength, restraint and resolve so as to encourage the USSR to back down and maintain an international reputation of being reasonable .
 Such is the communicative logic of brinkmanship that if they were to signal that they would not step up to the brink, then the Soviets would gain the upper hand, pushing their own interests until the USA backed down . The U.S. would be confident pushing their interests until they
 The impression of strength and resolve is meant to encourage the Soviet Union to back down . The impression was meant to give the impression of a strong stance to Soviet Russia .
 Khrushchev’s second letter publicly questioned the right of the USA to demand a level of security that it would not allow to others . The U.S. would not be allowed to provide security to others, the letter said .
 Khrushchev was staging the USA, setting up Kennedy to create a negative impression on world opinion, says Kennedy . Kennedy was trying to create an impression on the world opinion . Kennedy's assassination was part of a plan to stage the U.S. in advance of his assassination, says
 If the President accepts the deal offered in the second letter, the U.S. would have to publicly accept the idea that Turkey and Cuba are equivalent . The disarmament of Cuba would become tied to the disarmaments of Turkey, the President says .
 ExComm feared that such a trade would appear weak, and open the door for similar arguments to be made about the U.S. nuclear missiles in Italy and Britain . ExComm wanted to avoid appearing weak .
 Rejecting the deal would make it look like the USA was demanding a level of security that it was not prepared to offer other nations . But rejecting the deal makes it appear that the USA is demanding a higher security level .
 If the USA took the nuclear missiles out of Cuba by force, as Kennedy’s military advisors recommended, then the USSR would have justification for moving into Berlin and/or Turkey .
 It is a moment when distal third parties comprising the abstract notion of ‘world opinion’ manifest in the White House discussions and arguably change the course of history . The White House is in the midst of a historic moment in history .
 ExComm want world opinion on their side; but to get it they are being forced to act in accordance with Khrushchev’s wishes . ExComm. want world . opinion on . their side . But to get that they are . being forced . to act .
 President Kennedy suggests a counter-staging, to make the USSR appear unreasonable . In retaliation President Kennedy suggested a counterstaging . In response, the USSR was shown to be unreasonable .
 Kennedy suggests making the seemingly reasonable request that the USSR stops work on the missile bases before any negotiation of a resolution . Kennedy suggests stopping work on missile bases in the region before any negotiations are held .
 Kennedy believes that Khrushchev will not stop working on the bases . However, because the missiles in Cuba are useless until they are armed, Kennedy believes . Kennedy believes the missiles will not be able to be armed .
 Kennedy’s suggestion is to put the USSR in a situation where they themselves create a negative impression on world opinion, he says . Kennedy: "The USSR should be put in a position where they create an impression on the world"
 A second suggestion for dealing with Khrushchev’s maneuver comes from McNamara, Secretary for Defense . McNamara: ‘Krushchev's maneuver’ was a mistake .
 Turkish missiles could be defused before U.S. attack Cuba . And one way to avoid it is to defuse the Turkish missiles before we attack Cuba, says President Obama .
 McNamara proposes to stage a situation within which the USSR has no reasonable grounds for invading Turkey . McNamara is proposing to stage an invasion of Turkey within a reasonable distance .
 This plan pins Khrushchev publicly to his own logic of the equivalence between Cuba and Turkey . This plan pinpoints Khrushche to the idea of a Cuban-Turkish equivalence .
 The third suggestion for responding to Khrushchev’s staging comes from Thompson . Thompson: “Krushchev's staging of the Cold War was a mistake”
 Thompson's idea hinges upon the realization that Khrushchev’s first letter was private while his second one was public . Thompson: "The first letter is private while the second one is public" Thompson: “The idea hinges on the fact that Khrrushchev's first
 The rest of the world’s focus is back on Cuban and Latin American and the fact that we’re prepared not to invade. Then you’ve got the rest of . the world's focus back on Cuba and Latin America and the . fact that . we�
 Releasing the first, private, letter to the media would shift world attention to the first letter, such as in the public sphere . And this makes it, I think, much tougher for him, says Simon Tisdall .
 It would stage a situation where the USSR had to refuse agreement to the proposal of the first letter, and . insist upon a hardline stance which would undermine the reasonableness of the Soviet position .
 Khrushchev’s public second letter had created a stage for Kennedy to appear hypocritical . Kennedy and his advisors plot how to create a . stage for Khrush . to appear unreasonable; Kennedy and . his advisors plotted how to . create a stage . to create an image of Kh
 Such subtle communicative moves make denigrating the other seem very crude, says CNN's John Sutter . Sutter: "It's a very good thing to say, but it's not easy to say."
 If either side can make the other denigrate themselves through forcing an action which creates a negative impression, then a very subtle act of communication has been achieved . But, if either side . can . make an action that creates an impression of themselves, then it has a subtle effect .
 Robert Kennedy met with Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador in Washington . Robert Kennedy, the President’s brother and Attorney General, met with the Soviet ambassador in Washington.
 The deal agreed was that President Kennedy would guarantee the sovereignty of Cuba in exchange for the USSR withdrawing its missiles from Cuba . The deal was agreed in the 1960s .
 President Kennedy made a public acceptance of the deal offered in the first letter . Chairman Khrushchev gave orders to remove the missiles from Cuba . President Kennedy accepted the deal and ordered the missiles removed .
 This message was only known to a small group of the President’s advisors . The message was not known to the President's advisors, it was only revealed to a few .
 The message was that the USA would remove its missiles from Turkey, but only on condition that this second aspect of the deal could never be written down or made public . The U.S. would remove the missiles, but the deal would only be kept secret .
 Robert Kennedy, on behalf of the President, offered to agree to Khrushchev’s second hardline letter . Thus, in effect, Robert Kennedy offered to . agree to the President's request .
 The U.S. removed its nuclear missiles from Turkey shortly after the Crisis .
 The secrecy of this deal was because of President Kennedy, as an individual, seeking to avoid negative impressions in the minds of his advisors or electorate . President Kennedy sought to avoid bad impressions in his advisors, or electorate, he says .
 On the morning of the 28th, Khrushchev was confronted with two bits of news . Dobrynin’s report was the first time the Soviet Union had heard of the assassination of the Soviet leader .
 Khrushchev assumed that the U-2 spy plane had been shot down, which he assumed to be the work of Cuban forces . The plane was shot down by the U.S. and the Cuban government was responsible for it .
 Castro’s letter requested a nuclear strike if there was an invasion of Cuba . In actuality Castro requested a strike if he was invaded by the Cuban government .
 Castro in his letter and those who shot down the U-2 plane were trying to embolden Khrushchev . No doubt, Castro in . letter and . those . shot down . U.2 plane was shot down by the U.S. in 1961 .
 Khrushchev, on the basis of Dobrynin’s report, was able to get the nuclear missiles out of Turkey . The fortunate timing of events was due to the timing of the timing, says historian .
 The present analysis has pushed the boundary on what is usually considered communication . Discussion: "The present analysis is pushing the boundaries on communication" Discussion: The analysis shows that communication is a form of communication .
 The field of political communication, in contrast, has been at the forefront of recognizing the communicative significance of action . Political communication is a form of communication that allows people to express their feelings, say experts .
 As Goffman observed, words are easily manipulated, but perhaps more importantly words are cheap . Goffman: "Words are cheap. Words are cheap"
 Cheap talk is good for exchanging private information if the participants have reason to trust one another . Cheap talk can be good for sharing private information with the public .
 Khrushchev’s deployment of missiles in Cuba was of limited practical benefit, writes Peter Bergen . Bergen: The communicative significance of the deployment for socialist groups in Latin America is best understood when one considers the communicative meaning of the missile deployment .
 ExComm’s insistence that the nuclear missiles in Turkey could not be traded, despite the fact that they were obsolete and expensive to upkeep, is best understood by considering ExComm's desire to create the impression of being resolute and strong .
 The analysis goes beyond existing literature by distinguishing different impression management processes operating at various stages in the Crisis . The analysis is an attempt to go beyond existing existing literature .
 Other may ‘read’ certain actions or gestures as communicative unbeknownst to the actor . The other may 'read' certain actions and gestures as communicating .
 The communicative significance for ExComm was quite distinct from the explicit meanings given by Khrushchev in either letter . ExComm received the letters in the 1950s and 1960s .
 Castro's request to eliminate the enemy on Khrushchev was the opposite of emboldening him; it made him back down . Equally, the effect of Castro’s request for elimination of the enemy was also to embolden him .
 Goffman described the move to ‘expressions given off’ as part of an arms race . Goffman said the move was part of a 'arms race'
 Staging, like basic self-presentation, is an attempt to influence the conduct of others . Staging is a form of communication that can influence others' conduct .
 The first step in staging the other is not primarily communicative, rather it is to create a situation upon which the other will act in such a way as to create the impression desired by the stager in the minds of a third party . However, the first step is not to be
 Kennedy’s request that Khrushchev stop assembling the nuclear missiles in Cuba, was a clear act of staging . Kennedy assumed that Khushchev would not stop the assembly and thus it was an attempt to make him appear unreasonable . For example, Kennedy's request that . Khrush
 Staging is more complex than denigration or stigmatization (Garfinkel 1956, Goffman 1963) where the other is directly named and shamed . Staging and stigmatization are more complex and more complex .
 Staging the other entails creating a situation in which the other shame themselves in the eyes of a third party . The other is creating an opportunity to humiliate each other .
 Staging is powerful because audiences tend to underestimate situational determinants of behavior, and thus the staging is likely to be invisible . Staging makes the impression created all the more potent, and makes it more powerful .
 Staging the other disrupts common sense notions of communication because it involves a deliberate effort to make the other make an unintentional impression in the mind of a third party . The other is a deliberate attempt to make a deliberate impression .
 Mead’s key insight is that the meaning of a gesture begins with the response of the other . Conceptualizing such non-linguistic communication dynamics necessitates starting with Mead's key insight .
