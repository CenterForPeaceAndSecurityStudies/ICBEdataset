 Nowhere do the constitutional prerogatives of the president seem greater than in the midst of national security crises . The president should be given greater resources of command, the author says . The U.S. should also invest in the president in national security, he says .
 They often lack crucial information, use incomplete or misleading analogies to understand crisis situations . It difcult to micromanage events, and are unable to project force effectively, says President Obama .
 The White House did not reveal to the world how they had defused the crisis, a decision to maintain condentiality with far reaching consequences for subsequent presidential crisis decision making .
 According to the conventional accounts, the Soviets backed down because Kennedy understood their psychology, and his national security advisers had had . The conventional accounts of the Soviets backing down are said to be the reason Kennedy understood .
 In large measure, Kennedy’s response was shaped by domestic and international politics . Kennedy's response to the crisis was shaped in large measure by politics .
 The crisis was as much about presidential power stakes, prestige, and reputation as it was about balance of terror . Put another way, the crisis was about a balance of nuclear terror . It was also about the president's prestige and reputation .
 The Soviet missile sites were soft and vulnerable to an American strike . They were soft, vulnerable to the American strike, experts say .
 The Soviets had a large supply of MRBMs and of 2,000-mile-range IRBMs, sufcient to cover most of the U.S. if launched from Cuba .
 From the Soviet point of view, Kennedy’s strength and rmness—not his weakness—were the problem that the deployment of missiles was intended to address . Kennedy”s strength, not his weakness, was the problem, the Soviet said .
 Khrushchev in his memoirs claimed that his principal motivation had been to forestall new U.S. attacks on Cuba . He also claimed that he was protecting Cuba from new attacks .
 This was not the rst time the question of Jupiters had preoccupied Khrushchev . The question of the Jupits has preoccupied the former Soviet leader .
 He then recommended that Turkey be notied to dismantle the missiles so that they would not be subject to a Soviet preemptive strike . The missiles would be removed from Turkey in order to avoid a strike .
 The most important ‘backchannel’ involved KGB ofcer Georgii Bolshakov, Ambassador Dobrynin, and Attorney General Kennedy . The most significant “back channel’s” involved the KGB of Georgii Bolshakov and Ambassador
 President Kennedy convened a meeting in the Oval with Robert Kennedy, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, Theodore Sorensen, George Ball, Tommy Thompson, and Roswell Gilpatric . The Trollope ploy was approved by Tommy Thompson .
 The following day, acting on Kremlin instructions, Dobrynin was able to reassure Kennedy that the Soviets agreed to the U.S. insistence that the dismantling in Turkey would not occur immediately . Instead, it would take place four to ve months after the crisis was resolved . The
 Khrushchev noted that “it is somewhat difcult for you at the present time to publicly discuss the question of eliminating the United States missile bases in Turkey,” and agreed that the terms for ending the crisis should be considered condential .
 He insisted that Dobrynin take back the letter from Khrushchev, so there would be no evidence of the exchange in the U.S. government . The letter was taken back by Dobrynlinin, a Russian diplomat, in 1959 .
 Robert Kennedy’s posthumous recollections did not include the specics of the deal . Robert Kennedy was killed in 1968 . Kennedy's son was a Marine Corps veteran .
 Kennedy bypassed the ExComm, the Turks, the NATO allies, and everyone else that a consultative process would have required . It may be that Turkish intransigence about removal of the missiles may have led Kennedy to bypass the meeting, he says .
 Kennedy employed his own diplomatic prerogative powers, using his brother as a condential intermediary . Kennedy used his brother to be an intermediary for the president .
 The term itself makes no sense in this context, because no crisis can be managed until one or both parties redene the issue to the point at which it no longer remains a crisis . Gamesmanship can be supplanted by traditional diplomacy and political deal making, writes Andrew Hammond .
 At each of the stages of the game, into the nal two days, the players seem not to have understood the intentions of the cuban missile crisis and crisis management . The United States was to underestimate the nuclear capabilities of the Soviets, which the U.S. was
 When Soviet MIGS went to intercept it, Alaskan aircraft from Galena Air Force base in Alaska went to its rescue . The plane was shot down by Soviet aircraft .
 The United States planes were armed with nuclear weapons that could be . red on the pilot’s own authority . The U.S. planes were equipped with nuclear arms that could . be .red .
 The Soviet submarine had nuclear armed torpedoes and was authorized to use them if attacked . The submarine had been authorized to carry nuclear weapons if attacked by the Soviets .
 Had they killed Soviet military ofcers, the Soviets might have begun shooting down U.S. low-ying aircraft .
 The photos also showed six launchers for FROG battleeld nuclear missiles, and subsequent ights showed a total of 14 missiles . The photos were also shown in the photos .
 They also claimed to have had several nuclear bombs for their Iluyshin bombers . They also claim to have several nuclear warheads for their bombers .
 Top-level ofcials such as McGeorge Bundy were unaware at the time that the military had included such weapons in its planning .
 Kennedy would not have authorized rst use of such weapons, but no doubt would have sanctioned retaliatory strikes . Kennedy would have authorized strikes if Russia used tactical nuclear weapons .
 Cuban saboteurs blew up oil reneries in Venezuela, crippling one-quarter of oil production in the Caribbean . One-third of the Caribbean's oil production was crippled by the Cuban sabotage .
 Crisis by denition freed organizations from the ordinary constraints, says John Defterios . Crisis means that they were acting in an uncertain environment, he says .
 Aerial reconnaissance showed the Soviet Beagle IL-28 bombers continued to be assembled at the San Julian aireld . Aerial reconnaissance continued to show that the bombers were assembled .
 U-2 on routine air sampling mission from Alaska strayed into Soviet territory over the Chukhotsk peninsula in Siberia . U.S. planes scrambled to protect the U.2 from Soviet territory .
 Cuban air defense troops, acting under Castro’s orders, broke away from Soviet command and control and began shooting at low-ying U.S. aircraft entering Cuban airspace . The incident occurred during the Cuban Air Force raid .
 The U-2 was shot down over Cuba by a surface-to-air missile launched from a SAM site at Banes, near the eastern tip .
 Castro communicated to Khrushchev on the 26th in a “document” dictated to a bilingual Soviet ofcer, who relayed Castro’s words to Moscow . Castro communicated the message in a "document" dictated by a . bilingual Soviet .
 “We refrained from responding with nuclear warheads,” McNamara was to put it later . “The Soviet Union did not respond with nukes,’s McNamara said .
 Soviet air command in Cuba authorized the shooting on its own initiative, without waiting for its request to clear in Moscow . The shooting was authorized by the Soviet air force in Cuba .

 The U.S. would have tightened the embargo and then repackaged the missile deal, presumably using the Cordier Channel, which allowed U Thant to go public with an offer to trade . Had the Soviets stood on the 27th, the United States .
 Both Kennedy and Khrushchev misplayed their hands, but eventually they made a deal . By the time of the crisis they were frantically trying to keep the danger of nuclear confrontation contained .
 The Soviets did not intend their missiles in Cuba to change the military balance . Khrushchev intended their placement to redress the imbalance favoring the Americans until his own ICBMs could be deployed in sufcient numbers .
 Khrushchev gave strict orders to the military commanders in Cuba not to prepare these strategic missiles for ‎ring, nor to ‎mate” them . 65 Fursenko and Naftali, “One Hell of a Gamble,” 276. Furshenenko
 McNamara and Kennedy assumed that the Soviets had fty to seventy-ve strategic missiles, not the twenty or so they actually possessed . The Soviets had only about 20 or more missiles than they thought they had .
 Without realizing it, the Soviets already had a deterrent against a U.S. strike, without having to place missiles in Cuba and without . having to deploy missiles on their own territory . The Soviets didn't realize it, but they already had the deterrent .
 The United States could dene a large number of actions by Castro as aggressive . Castro's actions could be seen as aggressive by the U.S.
 It would have required a pledge not to invade Cuba, probably without any qualications . But it would have been required to pledge not invading Cuba . The U.S. has never invaded Cuba .
 Cold war was marked by rivalries and localized military conicts far more than by détente . Cold war ended in 1980s, but until the end of the 1980s it was dominated by rivals and local military .
 The political dangers of seeming willing to compromise with the enemy had to be managed through the ction that no compromise had occurred . The dangers of appearing willing to . compromise with . the enemy must be managed by the fact no compromise has occurred, he said .
 Kennedy himself was aware of the issue that the ctionalized version would open . Yet Kennedy was aware that the issue would open, he said .
