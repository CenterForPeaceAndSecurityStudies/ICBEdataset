 Last year I read Rockets and People, the totally fascinating memoir of Soviet rocket developer Boris Chertok . I'm still hoping to get around to reviewing one of these days .
 Chertok’s career encompassed both military and space-exploration projects, and in late October 1962 he was focused on preparations for launching a Mars probe . In October 1962, he was working on a mission to the Red Planet .
 At the gatehouse, there was usually a lone soldier on duty who would give my pass a cursory glance . At the end of the day, I was greeted by a solitary soldier .
 "Now suddenly I saw a group of soldiers wielding sub-machine guns, and they thoroughly scrutinized my pass," she says . "They thoroughly scrutinize my pass. Now suddenly suddenly ... they scrutinized me," she adds .
 Other groups of soldiers in full combat gear, even wearing gas masks, were running about the periphery of the secure area .
 The “duty” R-7A combat missile had always been covered and standing up against the wall, which we had always ignored, was uncovered . When I stopped in at the MIK, I immediately saw that the ‘duty’ missile had been uncovered .
 Chertok was greeted by his friend Colonel Kirillov, who was in charge of this launch facility . The launch facility is located in the Russian city of Chezakh .
 The chiefs of the directorates and commanders of the troop units were gathered there . The chiefs were gathered for the meeting .
 We were told that the firing range must be brought into a state of battle readiness immediately . The firing range was told to be brought in a state-of-battle readiness immediately.
 Due to the events in Cuba, air attacks, bombardment, and even U.S. airborne assaults are possible . Air attacks, bombardments, and air attacks could be possible .
 All Air Defense Troops assets have already been put into combat readiness . The U.S. Air Force says it is already in combat readiness for the first time .
 All facilities and launch sites have been put under heightened security . The launch site and launch site are under increased security at the time .
 I received the order to open an envelope that has been stored in a special safe and to act in accordance with its contents . But most important—I received the . order, he said, was to open the envelope that was stored in the special safe . He said: "I received
 According to the order, I must immediately prepare the duty combat missile at the engineering facility and mate the warhead located in a special depot, roll the missile out to the launch site, position it, test it, fuel it, aim it, and wait for a special launch command .
 The crews have been removed from the Mars shot and shifted over to preparation of the combat missile . Therefore, the crews have moved over to preparing the combat missiles .
 Chertok was apparently viewing the Cuban affair as a flash in the pan that would be resolved short of war . He was concerned that moving the Mars rocket would cause them to miss their October 29 launch date, and suggested that the swap of the rockets be delayed for a few hours .
 Kirillov told him that this was impossible, and that he should go to the “Marshal’s cottage,” where some of his associates wanted to see him . Kirilov said he should visit the "Marshal's cottage," where he was wanted to
 At the cottage, four men were seated at a table playing cards while a fifth was trying to glean the latest news from a radio . Lena, the housekeeper, was in the kitchen drying wine glasses . The housekeeper was drying wine dishes when the incident happened .
 It was suggested that since Chertok didn’t like playing cards, he should help Lena fix the drinks . Lena suggested that he should fix the drink .
 I took an enormous watermelon and two bottles of cognac out of the fridge . I took the enormous watermelons and cognac from the fridge. I took them out to the fridge and drank them all .
 U.N. Secretary General U Thant had sent personal messages to Khrushchev and Kennedy . U.S. Secretary of State U. Thant was responsible for sending messages to both men .
 This time we all drank down our toast in silence and very solemnly, realizing how close we now were to a situation in which this cognac and a watermelon could be our last . This time, we drank down the toast down in silence .
 Chertok went to another cottage and made a forbidden call to S P Korolev, overall head of the Soviet rocket program, who was then in Moscow . The call was made with considerable difficulty, with considerable difficulties, and Chertoks made the forbidden call .
 Korolev told him that things were being taken care of and not to worry . Korolevs: "Things are in the right place and things are going well"
 Lena brought out a bottle of “three star’s cognac from some secret stash . Lena brought it out to celebrate the “All clear” command .
 Few had been aware of the actual threat of a potential nuclear missile war at that time . Few had known of the potential threat of such a nuclear war .
 In any event, one did not see the usual lines for salt, matches, and kerosene that form during the threat of war . The lines of salt and matches were not seen .
 When the world really was on the verge of a nuclear catastrophe, only a very small number of people in the USSR and the U.S. realized it . Only a few people in Russia and the United States realized it, author says .
 Khrushchev and Kennedy exercised restraint and did not give in to their emotions . Kennedy and his colleagues exercised restraint, not giving in to emotions, says CNN's John Sutter .
 The military leaders of both sides did not display any independent initiative nor did they deviate at all from the orders of their respective heads of state. Moreover, the military leaders .
 He knew that the U.S. nuclear arsenal was many times greater than ours . President Obama knew that he had a nuclear arsenal of many times more than we had in the world . He said that the United States had a greater nuclear arsenal .
 Moscow's order to call off missile preparation and dismantle launch sites was a betrayal of Cuba’s interests . The Cubans did not know this and viewed Moscow’�s order as betrayal of their interests .
 President Kennedy had no doubt as to the United States’ nuclear supremacy . President Kennedy believed the U.S. had the nuclear supremacy in the world .
 "I did not have a high opinion of Kennedy and my family was outraged when they learned I had voted for Nixon in 1960," she says . She says her family was "outraged" when she learned she voted for President Nixon .
 I recently read Disinformation and the author made a plausible case, almost in passing, that he believed Kennedy was killed by Khrushchev .
 It fit into the wider theme of his discussion of the disinformation forces of the USSR, and how they soon afterwards had had had everyone pointing at the CIA, LBJ, the mafia, everyone but the obvious culprits .
 Most people around the world now believe, on no evidence, that the CIA killed Kennedy, yet dismiss Oswald's obvious connections to the CPUSA and the USSR's reasons to have Kennedy killed . Yet, Oswald’s connections to CPUSA, and the Soviet Union, were obvious .
 The disinformation forces employed by the USSR were greater in number than the armed forces . He describes how they long ago infiltrated, co-opted, then took command of the western left’s media and propaganda arms .
 That one finds similar themes and approaches in Soviet propaganda, Hollywood movies, the NYT and government schools is not a coincidence nor an accident . The New York Times, the Times and the NYT are among the sites of Soviet propaganda .
 Epstein’s two books, The JFK Assassination Diary, and his book about Oswald, Legend are both excellent . He suggests that Oswald may have had KGB ties but that the Cubans, if anyone, were more likely behind it .
 From what I have read, Castro was extremely bitter about the resolution of the crisis, which he viewed as a betrayal by the Russians .
 Had he had control over the missiles, he would very likely have launched them, says CNN.com .
 It’s remarkable how many people outside of Cuba still give Castro the benefit of doubt despite all evidence .
 Millions of Cubans will cry as if they’d lost their father . They’re why he’ll probably die in his bed and millions will cry . He’s likely to die in bed .
 Yeah, I don’t think it was the Sovs . Andrew X says he doesn't think it's the Russians .
 In the US/USSR game, offing each other leaders was pretty much out of bounds . Offing each others leaders was not out bounds in the US and Russia .
 If we seriously went after a Soviet Premier, they would consider it active war . You know that if . we seriously . went after them, it would be active war, he says . He says .
 If either side were to get credible info that such a thing did occur, things could get extremely ugly, even out of political control ugly .
 The ramifications of getting discovered would be enormous . Surely they would hide their hand better than that, like Mehemt Agca and JP-II .
 The Soviets were horrified by the event, frightened in no small measure, and basically flipped out when they heard it was Oswald and knew who he was . And he reported quite clearly that the Soviets were .
 Oswald defected to the Soviet Union at one point, but the U.S. goverment never really thought the Soviets had a hand in it . This was duly reported back to DC, and history records .
 Odds on favortite is that Oswald were just two nuts, with guns and well-placed . Odds are that Oswald and Oswald were both nuts with guns . Oswald was a nut with guns, with a gun and well placed .
 The Mafia underworld was furious at Bobby even more than Jack, over what they saw as a betrayal after helping put them in office, only to see RFK’s Justice Dept go literally gangbusters against them . RFK's Justice Dept. went gangbusters, and the Mafia underworld
 Political reasons for Soviet involvement are political reasons, not moral ones . But I just think to much adds up against Soviet involvement…. Political reasons, rather moral ones.
 If anybody had a hand in Oswald’s actions, it was Cuba, says MikeK .
 There were nuclear tactical warheads in Cuba so a 1962 invasion was probably not a good idea . Also, it was later found that there were tactical tactical warheads .
 I was all set to post about Morris Childs and Operation SOLO, but Andrew X beat me to it, and did a better job of explaining it .
 Morris Childs understood Russian, courtesy of his immigrant parents, but never let on to the Soviets that he understood Russian . Childs reported about the Soviet role in the JFK assassination but never told them .
 He would hear Russians speak among themselves before he heard the translation . So he would hear the Russians speak to each other among themselves . He would then hear the translation of the language .
 Morris Childs and the translator spoke among themselves . They discussed among themselves, what they discussed among them was what they said .
 I also suspect that Castro could have had something to do with the JFK assassination . Castro could also have been involved in the assassination of JFK, author says .
 Oswald went to Mexico City in September 1963 in an unsuccessful attempt to get a visa for Cuba . Oswald was in Mexico City trying to get the visa for the island nation .
 Oswald must have given enough life history information to entice Cubans to apply for a visa . In the process of applying for a . visa, Oswald must give enough information to . entice the Cubans .
 When Oswald was back in Dallas, it wouldn’t have been difficult for the Cubans to get in touch with him . Oswald was in Dallas at the time of the Dallas assassination .
 Cuban role could have been as simple as one of encouragement, MikeK points out .
 Oswald, a hothead who had already taken a potshot at right-wing General Walker, would have needed much encouragement . Oswald was already taking potshots at General Walker . Oswald would have been encouraged by his actions .
 People tend to get caught up in the detail and forget the bigger picture with regard to the crisis . A good investment .
 The Soviet Unions ballistic missile capability was woefully inadequate at the time, both in quality and quantity . The Soviet Union's missile capability in the 1960s was inadequate . The missile capability is now considered inadequate .
 The Sovs were particularly alarmed when the United States placed missile bases in Turkey and wanted them removed . The U.S. wanted the bases removed .
 Kennedy thought LeMay mad. LeMay knew the poor bargaining position that they were in and wanted to call their bluff, Kennedy thought . LeMay was mad. Kennedy thought he was mad .
 In the end the Sov’s got the missiles out of Turkey by getting the U.S. to back down . The United States backed down .
 The way the Kennedy administration put the spin on it was by painting as the Soviets backing down as a response of the blockade and the threat of war . The Kennedy administration portrayed the situation as the result of a blockade .
 Russia backed down after the United States agreed to pull missiles out of Turkey . In reality, the U.S. backed down and the missiles were pulled from Turkey .
 As a group they were more concerned with their own survival and the survival of Communism . Not because he won, but because as a group . They were more . concerned with themselves and their survival, says historian .
 They knew that they had come close, and saw Krushev’s ‘adventurism’ as something that was too risky for them liking . The Russians knew that it was too dangerous for them to take part in .
 Khrushchev also became convinced that Kennedy was weak during the Vienna summit .
 "We are seeing a parallel situation now which may well blow up the middle east," says Peter Bergen . Bergen says the situation is 'a parallel situation which may blow up middle east'
 Ray Rust: Interesting discussion but I take a different view . Ray Rust says he disagrees with his view .
 From his reading about Krushev he thought Kennedy was a light weight and someone he could bully . From my reading about . Krushesv thought Kennedy . was someone he thought . could bully. From my . reading about  Krusheyv thought . Kennedy was . a
 Counterfactual history, if Nixon would have won the Presidency in 1960 I don’t think Krushev would have challenged Nixon,e.e. The famous Kitchen debates, etc. etc. would have taken place .
 Vincent Buglosi’s 1600 page book on the Kennedy assassination refutes all these half-baked theories . On conspiracy, please read his 1600 pages book on Kennedy assassination where he refutes .
 The only true conspiracy in the assassination of a President was the Lincoln assassination . Lincoln assassination was Lincoln's assassination . Only true conspiracy was Lincoln assassination.
 Counterfactual history, if Nixon would have won the Presidency in 1960 I don’t think Krushev would have challenged Nixon, i.e. the famous Kitchen debates, etc. Proven with real evidence .
