 Sputnik only further deepened the sense of national humiliation in the U.S. public sphere . This belief generated a panic in the United States public sphere; and it was a panic . The United States was humiliated by its actions in the wake of the Russian spy operation .
 The U.S. possessed many more nuclear warheads than the Soviets, but no gap emerged . The United States would soon stand armed with a new generation of Atlas and Titan missiles, .
 Eisenhower decided to place IRBMs in various NATO countries in order to strengthen NATO, both militarily and psychologically . Eisenhower's decision was made in the wake of 9/11 attacks on NATO's enemies .
 NATO members unanimously approved Eisenhower’s missile plan . Most of them refused the weapons, some because they feared antagonizing the Soviet Union . Others did not want to provoke domestic opposition .
 Only three NATO countries, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Turkey, accepted them . The United States, Italy and Turkey accepted them as part of NATO .
 Turkey was not originally the US’s ﬁrst choice, as it was thought installing a missile site in the immediate proximity of one of the USSR's borders would provoke strong Soviet reaction . In spite of its willingness to receive these weapons, Turkey wasn’t originally
 The refusal of other countries, particularly France, to cooperate put Turkey on the frontline . However, the refusal of others to cooperate has put Turkey at the forefront .
 Turkey signed an agreement on 25 October 1959, accepting an instalment of 15 Jupiter missiles in Izmir, a Turkish city on the coast of the Aegean Sea . Turkey ignored several Soviet warnings .
 The decision to launch would be made by SACEUR only with the consent of the U.S. and Turkish governments . The decision would only be made with the United States and Turkey's consent .
 The Jupiter missiles were obsolescent due to their use of liquid fuel, their slow ignition time, their inaccuracy and vulnerability . The interesting thing is that the Jupiter missiles are obsolescent .
 New modern weapons such as the Polaris and the seaborne nuclear force were developed soon after Jupiter arrangement was signed .
 1957 marked a milestone in U.S. foreign policy regarding the Middle East . The year 1957 marked the year 1957 .
 Eisenhower Doctrine of 1957 signalled the White House’s resolution to be more actively involved in the Middle East . The Eisenhower Doctrine was a response to the growing threat posed by the U.S. in the region .
 Menderes government5 had been eager to play a major role in the region in order to gain support from Washington, hence enhancing its own security in the face of the Soviet threat . Before this, the proAmerican Mendes government had been keen to play major role .
 This stance had also suited U.S. foreign policy in the region, as seen in the Baghdad Pact of 1955, signed by Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom .
 The Menderes government had worked hard to bring Middle Eastern countries into the pact . The Suez Crisis of 1956 was negatively aﬀected by the Suez crisis .
 Iraq pulled out of the Baghdad pact after experiencing a military coup in 1958 . Inevitably, Turkey’s role in U.S. policy-making endeavours in the Middle East became a secondary matter . The United States failed to provide the financial aid it had promised, due
 Menderes administration tried to promote a closer relationship with the USSR in order to secure from the Soviets the support Turkey so desperately needed . The relationship between Russia and Turkey was one of the most successful in the world .
 Menderes administration’s foreign policy track record from 1958 onwards, one is impressed by the evidence that Turkey abandoned a unilateral foreign policy . Turkey abandoned its unilateral policy in 1958, one writes .
 Ankara tried to establish a balance in its relations with the superpowers by courting Moscow . In fact, Ankara has courted Moscow to establish balance with superpowers .
 Lủtﬁ Kırdar, the Turkish Minister of Health, paid a visit to Moscow in 1959, and planned for Menderes and Nikita Khrushchev to exchange visits following the Washington summit in Washington in September 1959 .
 Soviet Embassy personnel in Ankara had become more active in their contact with Turkish authorities, institutions and newspapers in an attempt to gain the support of more inﬂuential Turks and increase contacts between Turkish and Soviet politicians . At the same time, the Soviet Embassy in Ankara became more active
 These developments are perceived as a challenge to the American authorities’ political establishment in the region . Not unsurprisingly, these developments were perceived as an attempt to challenge the U.S. political establishment . The situation in Syria has been described as a 'significant development'
 Turkish diplomats in Iran spent their time and energy trying to convince the Shah that there was nothing to worry about . Following this warning, Turkish diplomats tried to convince him there was no need to worry, he says .
 Diplomat: U.S. feared Turkey’s new approach to Moscow, taken without permission from Washington, could provoke some undesirable moves against American interests by NATO members or other democratic countries .
 There had been more extensive discussion of Turkish foreign policy in the Turkish press since 1959 . As a matter of fact, there had been a more extensive . discussion of Turkey foreign policy since 1959, says Erdogan .
 Turkey’s adherence to the West was constantly reiterated, and not even one article indicated the Turks’ disagreement with the West . Most pointed out that a new era was beginning and that perhaps tactics should change, most pointed out .
 This article is signiﬁcant because it posed the question of how Turkey could capitalize on its position in the East-West conﬂict . Turkey's strategic value of its geographic position had decreased due to advancements in defence technology, it said .
 The article correctly observed certain changes in attitudes toward foreign policy that had taken place in the USA since the death of Secretary Dulles and in the USSR since the accession of Khrushchev . It correctly observed that the USA had changed its foreign policy since Dulles died .
 Americans are readjusting their view of their allies across the Atlantic . Americans were readjusted to their views of the U.S. President Barack Obama .
 At this point, one of the U.S. policymakers’ main concerns with Turkey’s rapprochement with the USSR was Menderes’ readiness to accept ﬁnancial aid from Moscow, which, they felt, might lead to Soviet in�
 If Ankara had not viewed the Soviets as a threat to Turkish sovereignty, its acceptance of financial aid might have signalled a new era in which the USSR would come to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East . The American National Council says Ankara's acceptance of aid could have been a new
 Turkey's desire to be accepted by Western Europe and the United States as a member of the Western community had helped it to maintain a staunch pro-Western and anti-Soviet foreign policy . The USA was worried that Turkey might now seek economic, political and military cooperation with Moscow .
 The Menderes government was becoming a fragile structure that might put the US’s vital interests at stake . Hence, from the U.S. perspective, it was becoming an unstable structure . The Mendes government is becoming an increasingly fragile structure .
 Menderes tried to persuade Washington and Turkey’s other allies that his relations with the Soviets represented nothing more than a regional version of a more positive atmosphere created by recent visits and exchanges between the Soviets and Western leaders . Mendere: The atmosphere has been created by visits and
 He argued that Turkey had never intended to make unilateral concessions to the Soviets which could harm the position of the free world . He said that Turkey did not intend to give concessions to Soviet Russia .
 This new approach, he said, was motivated by a purely pragmatic assessment of his country’s situation, but had been misinterpreted by some of its NATO allies . The new approach is motivated by an assessment of the situation, he added .
 At the time, American oﬃcials categorically denied the possibility of reaching an agreement with the USSR in order to dispel the notion that relationships between Moscow and Washington had been improving .
 Following the military coup of May 1960, the military regime declared its respect for Turkey’s commitments to NATO and the USA . The military regime emphasized its loyalty to Turkey's traditional Western-oriented foreign policy . Following the 1960 coup of Turkey, the Turkish military regime expressed respect for NATO
 The new leaders are pursuing a multilateral foreign policy . However, it soon became clear that the new leaders were also pursuing multilateral policy .
 In the meantime, the USSR stepped up its eﬀorts to inﬂuence Turkey and made enticing o﬉ers of economic assistance . In the 1980s, the Soviet Union made enticing economic assistance to Turkey .
 Although the military government, strained by the country’s economic crisis, was undoubtedly tempted by these oﬀers, it did not accept them . The military government refused to accept them, despite the growing support for them .
 Washington believed elements within the Turkish government were urging the acceptance of at least some additional Soviet assistance, on the grounds that Turkey was in a position to beneﬁt from both sides of the Cold War, as neutrals did . However, in light of serious criticism of Turkey�
 There seemed to be little likelihood that Turkey would join the ranks of the 'neutralists' as long as the Soviet threat remained . Turkey’s friends and allies provided suﬃcient aid to make continued resistance to Soviet oﬀers possible .
 The United States had to find a way to guarantee that Turks would continue to view the USSR as a threat . The U.S. had to ensure that the provisional Turkish government would not be pulled closer to the USSR, out of the grasp of the US and Western allies .
 The major bargaining cards in Turkey’s hands, according to Turkish government assessments, were the continued Soviet threat to its sovereignty and its strategic position, which was indispensable to the United States . The proposed missile installation was one of the main symbolic responses to the Soviet threat, and hence served
 Turkish diplomats never missed an opportunity to use this card in their contacts with Americans . For this reason, Turkish diplomats used this card to gain access to the U.S.
 Selim Sarper, the Turkish Foreign Minister, referred to great technological and psychological improvements in the battle against Soviet propaganda aimed at Turks . On 6 June 1961, in his conversation with Raymond R Hare, American Ambassador to Ankara, Selim .
 After the coup, the Soviets had promised many things and had urged citizens to seek power, students to seek more liberty, and Muslims to remain conservative and avoid the West . The Soviets had also urged all citizens, including Muslims, to stay conservative .
 Bizim Radio, in particular, was an eﬀective source of propaganda in this regard . The state broadcaster was a propaganda source for the Soviet Union .
 Sarper informed Hare of the attitude of many senior military oﬃcers, who were complaining that the U.S. had not given enough assistance, he said .
 Turkish oﬃcials went on to connect all issues to their unfulﬁlled desire for military equipment . On the basis of this unsubstantiated but generally accepted premise, Turkish o ﬉cials said .
 Concerns about the US’s modiﬁcation of strategic concepts in a manner possibly detrimental to Turkey culminated in a response to Kennedy's statement emphasizing the importance of Western Europe .
 At some point immediately prior to Kennedy’s entrance into the White House, Turkey became an important element in Soviet foreign policy regarding Cold War politics . Turkey was an important part of the Soviet policy regarding the Cold War .
 The Kremlin desired Turkey’s departure from its Western-oriented foreign policy and its establishment of closer relations with Moscow . In order to strengthen its hand against Washington, the Kremlin sought Turkey's departure from Western-orientated foreign policy . The Kremlin wanted Turkey to become closer to Moscow,
 The Kremlin’s stance regarding Turkey should be examined within the missile context . The Kremlin's stance on Turkey should also be examined in the missiles context, writes CNN's John Defterios .
 As the United States built military establishments within the NATO context along its Eastern border, the Kremlin could not remain unmoved . As the U.S. built military facilities within NATO context, Russia could not stay unmoved.
 From the very beginning, Moscow put pressure on Turkey to discontinue the missile plans . Sometimes this pressure came in the form of threatening language, says CNN's Peter Bergen .
 The Soviet Union had once before secured the attention of the Turkish government, on 28 April 1959, on the occasion of accord negotiations between Turkey and the U.S. concerning the construction of missile bases on Turkish territory .
 The U-2 spy-plane had taken oﬀ from the American airbase in Incirlik, Turkey, and was shot down on 1 May 1960 in the region of Sverdlovsk .
 Soviet-Turkish military circles claim foreign military circles threatened the security of the USSR and Turkey, but also that of their neighbours . They claim that in utilizing bases placed at their disposal on Turkish territory, foreign .
 The Turkish government had replied that measures taken by Turkey within the framework of its alliances were not directed against the USSR . The Soviet tone had not always been so threatening .
 Nikita Rijov, the Soviet Ambassador to Ankara, was trying to ascertain how much political quid pro quo the Turks might give . Some articles that appeared in the Turkish press in early January 1962 claimed that the Soviets would make $500 million in Soviet credit available .
 A Turkish daily newspaper with socialist leanings, Cumhuriyet, claimed that the Soviet oﬀer of aid was contingent on the elimination of missiles and other bases on Turkish soil .
 In early January 1962, the Turkish press featured various stories about Soviet oﬀers of aid . The Turkish press published stories about the Soviet aid .
 Turkey strongly reaﬃrmed Turkey’s loyalty to NATO and CENTO alliances on 9 January 1962, as well as its support for UN policy . Meanwhile, Inönủnu̇nu̙s rea שּׁshr
 He made clear that although Turkey wanted to get along with the USSR within the above frameworks, it was not possible to form an alliance . Turkey would avoid provocative policies, but would not want to form alliance with USSR, just as it could not be neutral .
 At the same meeting, Inönủ spoke of a favourable development in relations with the US, and indicated that the Turkish government would cooperate with a new American approach to economic assistance . The Turkish government will cooperate with the new U.S. approach .
 Sarper had reportedly been displeased with alleged Soviet oﬀers of aid, characterized the press publicity as ‘part of the Soviet’s own propaganda’ and spoken encouragingly about the American economic and military assistance policy . A few days earlier, at the Turkish
 The magnitude of socio-political developments in Berlin, Cuba and Laos increased the Cold War political tension, just as Kennedy entered the White House .
 Committee members suggested a Polaris submarine should be deployed and operated by American personnel . Instead, they said it should be operated and controlled by Americans .
 Some memoirs and documents suggest that President Kennedy wanted to end the Jupiter missiles plan . He ordered their removal before October 1962, because they were considered insecure and vulnerable .
 Kennedy’s memoirs convey his shock when he learned during the crisis that the missiles were still in Turkey . Kennedy: "I was shocked to learn that there were still missiles in Turkey"
 Kennedy knew all the details about the Jupiter missiles, he says . The missiles were installed in late 1961 to fulﬁl the 1959 agreement . Kennedy's administration, not Eisenhower’s, installed the missiles, says Kennedy .
 If this is true, then the construction of the Jupiter missiles would not yet have begun when Kennedy stepped into power .
 NSC suggested that the projected deployment of IRBMs to Turkey not be cancelled . The NSC had suggested the deployment should not have been cancelled .
 Bernstein suggests it was no accident that the committee was to be chaired by a representative from the State Department . The State Department did not look favourably upon the removal of the Jupiter missiles, for political reasons .
 The NSC's evaluation was based primarily on the State Department’s logic . In short, the NSC said it was based on State Department logic .
 The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, raised this matter with Sarper at CENTO, the latter’s reaction was strongly adverse . Rusk: “When the Secretary . of State . raised the matter with . Sarper, he said, “The Secretary of
 Turkish people would hardly understand the reason why the missiles were to be removed, says Sarper . Sarper explained that as the Turkish government had just spent a lot of money on the missile installation, the Turkish people wouldn't understand the decision to remove them .
 Turkey's citizens regarded Jupiter missiles as a symbol of the alliance’s determination to use atomic weapons in the case of a Soviet attack on Turkey . American authorities could not successfully put pressure on the Turkish government, because Turkey’�s citizens regarded the Jupiter missiles to be a symbol
 Turkish authorities stated on more than one occasion that Jupiter missiles based on Turkish soil represented ‘ﬁrm proof of the U.S.’�s commitment to Turkey’s security’ – whereas submarines cruising the Mediterranean with Polaris missiles clearly did not . Ironically,
 The support of General Norstad, who emphasized the military importance of sending IRBMs to Turkey, displayed in his discussion with Sarper regarding the Jupiter missiles’ presence in Turkey, also made it unlikely to persuade the Turkish military to abandon the project .
 Kennedy disliked going ahead with the Jupiter project, but understood the Turkish point of view, Nash says . Nash points out that Kennedy disliked the project, and understood the idea .
 Turkey’s insistence on keeping IRBMs in its territory contains some historical irony . Turkey has insisted that it will not allow the use of any of its missiles in the country .
 In naming the Jupiter missiles after him, it is clear that the authors wanted to emphasize the missiles’ lack of defensive capacity . In naming them after him it was clear that it was intended to emphasize their lack of defense capacity .
 The missiles continued to be viewed as a symbol of Turkey’s importance within the Western security system, and also as a source of prestige . Although it is likely that most Turkish authorities were aware of their limited defensive value .
 Turkish military authorities were also reluctant to give up the missiles . For this reason alone, Turkey's military authorities are also reluctant .
 Admiral Sezai Orkunt was head of the Turkish Military Mission in Washington from 1961 to 1964 . He says he was in charge of Turkey's military mission in Washington, D.C., from 1961-1964 .
 Orkunt wrote in his book that Turkish military authorities had been informed of the Jupiter missiles’ low military value for Turkish defence, but that his report was ignored by Turkish military . He wrote that the Turkish military had been told of the missile's low value .
 The Turkish government did not have the luxury of acting against military authorities’ wishes . The military had a strong inﬂuence on governmental decision making . In fact, the Turkish government was not allowed to act against military authority’s wishes .
 It seems unlikely that the Turkish government could have supported the instalment if the Chiefs of the Turkish General Staﬀ had not wanted it .
 The military value of Turkish Jupiter missiles was discussed not only at the administrative level, but also in the Western and the Turkish press . The value of the missiles has been discussed in the Turkish and the Western press .
 Jupiter missile bases in Turkey and Italy would be removed because the U.S. had manufactured a suﬃcient number of Polaris submarines and launching missiles . Polaris missiles could be able to move bases upon command .
 The same newspaper article stated that this change would take place after 1 November 1962 . The same article said this change was to take place in 1962 .
 Reports indicated that this decision might also aﬀect United States aid to Turkey . Such reports were then quoted by some Turkish papers, and it was indicated .
 Socialist weekly Yön commented that past and present assistance given to Turkey by Western countries had been provided primarily due to Turkey’s military importance . For instance, the socialist weekly . Yỏn said that Western countries . had provided assistance primarily due . to Turkey's military
 Since Polaris missiles would decrease Turkey’s role in Western defence, it must, therefore, be expected that future foreign aid would not be as generous . Future foreign aid should be less generous .
 The Turkish Foreign Ministry did not want to believe that there would be any question of the removal of the Jupiter missiles for years to come . Yỏn concluded, “I don’t think that’s any possibility of removing the missiles from the country . However,
 On 23 August 1962, Kennedy ordered George Ball, the Under-Secretary of State, to accelerate the removal of Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Italy .
 The Department of State opposed the removal of the missiles from Turkey because of Turkey’s displeasure over the proposal . Kennedy was ready to cancel the project at the expense of oﬀending his ally .
 Kennedy’s directive failed again, as the proposal once again faced strong objections, from both Turkey and the US Secretary of State . The proposal was rejected by both the US and Turkey .
 In reality, Kennedy’s directive did not mean that Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be dismantled immediately, for they had become operational only a short time before .
 In fact, American political circles were well aware that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey were obsolete and provided no military advantage . But the real problem was political and by no means simple, and it was not simple . The U.S. was well aware of the fact that the missiles were obsolete
 Withdrawal of the missiles could cause a major crisis of conﬁdence, which would complicate and deepen the political turmoil and perhaps enhance the establishment of a military dictatorship there .
 U.S. understood that the Turks would view such a decision as desertion by an ally . United States oﬃcials understood that such a move would be considered desertion of an ally by the Turks . The United States believed that such an action would be seen as
 American authorities were not just concerned about Turkey’s reaction, but also about the way a trade-oﬀ would be read by many other allies, particularly of those on the Asian–Soviet periphery . U.S. authorities were also concerned about how a deal would be
 The Jupiter issue acquired more dangerous overtones when the Cuban Crisis erupted 22 October 1962 .
 On this date, the American government instigated a naval blockade of Cuba . The White House learned that the Soviet Union had begun to install intermediateand long-range missile sites in Cuba . Certain nuclear warheads targeted the US .
 No American authorities foresaw that the Soviets would install a missile site in Cuba . However, with the exception of John McCone, the CIA director, no American officials foresaw it .
 When the crisis erupted, American authorities argued that the Soviet weapons were designed for aggression and had been deployed secretly . U.S. authorities said that the weapons were defensive and were deployed openly . The U.N. says that American weapons were not designed to be used for aggression .
 The installation of Jupiter missiles in Turkey was not the main factor in Khrushchev’s decision to install missiles in Cuba . Of course, the installation of . Jupiter missiles was not . the main . factor in the decision .
 His brinkmanship on the Berlin issue and the uniﬁcation of Germany played a larger role . The pressure he put on the U.S. to solve problems in Germany, played a bigger role .
 Khrushchev had to restore Castro’s conﬁdence in Moscow . The possibility that Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader, Prime Minister, and later President of Cuba – might distance himself from Moscow – meant that something had to be done .
 In retrospect, it seems that the existence of Jupiter missiles in Turkey provided quite a reasonable excuse for the Soviet installation of intermediateand long-range missiles sites in Cuba .
 Khrushchev had long badgered American visitors about missile sites along the Soviet periphery . Even so, Khrushche had long been badgered by American visitors to Soviet missile sites .
 Harriman stressed that there had undoubtedly been great pressure on Khrushchev for a considerable time to do something about the American ring of bases . The situation was only further aggravated by the American placement of Jupiter missiles in Turkey .
 Khrushchev frequently referred in one way or another to what was being discussed in the Kremlin councils . The former Soviet leader often referred to what he thought was a secret .
 President Eisenhower said that the Soviet Union must be dealt with like America, as a partner equal in strength . The relationship had become more deﬁnite as a result of new Soviet inﬂuence in the Western Hemisphere .
 Harriman felt the proposal and actual placement of American missiles in Turkey and Italy had been counterproductive, both to US–Soviet relations and domestically . He felt that the placement of missiles in Italy and Turkey would be counterproductive .
 The existence of the missiles was humiliating to Soviet pride . Even though these missiles could easily be destroyed, their existence had been humiliating to the Soviet government .
 Harriman had thought for some years that since the U.S. had begun a policy of abandoning military bases, the bases should have been used in negotiations with the Soviet Union, he says .
 Khrushchev could have won the hearts of his people and justiﬁed a more cooperative approach if he could have shown that these bases had been eliminated through his negotiation . The Soviet Union could have just won hearts of its people if he had shown these bases were eliminated through
 Harriman convinced that the U.S. should do its best to reduce the inﬂuence of the more hawkish group in the Kremlin councils and to increase that of more cooperative members . Harrimans even stated that since 1941 he had been convinced that .
 Khrushchev was persuaded to take this dangerous action in Cuba by the more hawkish group . He claimed that Khrushchevitch was persuaded by the group of hawkish groups .
 Turkey borders us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other . But, Turkey border us; we're not afraid to go to Turkey .
 You have placed destructive missile weaponry, which you call oﬀensive, in Turkey, literally, right next to us, Turkish President Vladimir Putin says . You've placed destructive missiles weaponry, he says .
 Khrushchev hinted that there was only one way out of this crisis, namely a Turkey–Cuba trade-oﬀ to be sounded by Kennedy . This was a hint that there must be a trade deal between Turkey and Cuba .
 Kennedy began to accept the Cuba–Turkey analogy . It was at this point that Kennedy began accepting the analogy .
 The State Department already knew from earlier talks with Turkish oﬃcials that this would create serious political and military problems for American–Turkish relations . Turkey’s place in the NATO alliance is at risk .
 Turkish military skill is Turkey's greatest asset to the U.S. and to the West, generally speaking . It is here that we would have the most to lose in the process of the Jupiter removal .
 Turks might get the impression that their interests as an ally were being traded oﬀ in order to appease an enemy . Turks might see the trade as a way of appeasing an enemy. Turks might be getting the impression .
 The problem was substantive in the sense that the Turks set great store on arms, which they felt necessary to meet their needs, and just a year before had been adamant in refusing the American suggestion that the Jupiter project might not be implemented .
 If the U.S. insisted on removal, then the Turkish demand for arms would be sizeable . Since then, there had been no indication that their position had changed .
 In that case, they might have some interest in Polaris or seaborne nuclear force . But, it was doubtful that they would consider either of these options an adequate compensation for the loss of the Jupiter missiles .
 Finletter understood the fact that the Jupiter missiles’ obsolete and vulnerable status did not aﬀect Turkish thinking . After his conversation in Paris with Feridun Cemal Erkin, who replaced Sarper on 25 March 1962, Finletter believed the Jupiter missile was obsolete
 Any arrangement that did not guarantee atomic capability equal to that of the Jupiter missiles on Turkish soil would be rejected by the Turks . It was apparent that any arrangement that . did not . guarantee atomic capabilities equal to . that of that of Jupiter missiles, the Turks rejected .
 The removal of the missiles and subsequent stationing of submarines in the area left doubts about whether the mere deployment of a Polaris would be attractive to Turkish authorities . Turkish authorities would have no power to use a Polaris in a time of crisis .
 They had already turned down a similar proposal in April 1961, 1961 .
 Turkish concern regarding a Polaris substitution might be partially met by consulting them on targeting, so as to assure them that targets in which they were interested would be covered by a Polaris .
 Three Polaris submarines in the area would more than double the coverage then aﬀorded by obsolete Jupiter missiles . It would also be important to assure them that three Polaris submarines would e�™ectively more than doubled the coverage .
 Finletter doubted that the above arrangements would adequately compensate the Turks . Finletter doubts that the Turkish government would be able to compensate them .
 If such a suggestion were made, it should be an acceptable arrangement for the Turks, fairly compensating them for the loss of the obsolete Jupiter missiles . The Turks should be fairly compensated for their loss of obsolete missiles .
 Such an oﬀer would take the form of converting a number of merchant-type vessels to a Middle Range Ballistic Missile force, utilizing Polaris A-2 missiles . The project would take place in the form a series of merchant vessels .
 Ships could be deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean with appropriate targets of interest . They could be manned by mixed Turkish, Italian, American, and possibly Greek crews .
 The Polaris deployment would then fill the gap caused by the removal of Jupiter missiles, while a southern command multilateral force was being put together . Polaris would then be deployed to replace Jupiter missiles .
 The Policy Planning Committee of the State Department was of the opinion that the eﬀects of phasing out or eliminating the Jupiter missiles in Turkey could lead to the fall of the Turkish government unless suitable NATO measures were taken .
 Committee’s suggestion for dealing with the Jupiter missiles in Turkey was to ‘push hard’ to establish the Pilot Southern Command Multilateral Force .
 The Committee suggested that Finletter should be instructed to solicit the North Atlantic Council’s consideration of the sea-based multilateral MRBM concept .
 Turkey strongly objected to some U.S. commentators’ tendency to equate the Soviet missile bases in Cuba with the missiles in Turkey . Turkey objected to the notion that the bases were in Cuba .
 Turks claim the U.S. bases in Turkey are not speciﬁcally American . They say they are a joint eﬀort by the United States and Turkey to carry out NATO requirement .
 By agreeing to the NATO requirement, Turkey, like Italy and the UK, had demonstrated courage, resolution and a deep commitment to the common defence of the NATO region as a whole . Turkey, Italy and UK have demonstrated courage and resolution to the issue .
 The Turks sought to minimize the Turkish–Soviet bilateral irritants and transfer this relationship into a broad pattern of East–West confrontation . Turkey bitterly resented being equated ‘with a country in the Caribbean, run by a . country run by . a bearded pirate who had turned his
 Substitution of the local Jupiter missiles for a multinational area force could constitute contribution to this policy objective without constituting a concession to the Soviets . Substitution would be a contribution to the policy objective .
 During the crisis, the Turkish government and military authorities also feared that the allied countries’ reaction would not escape the notice of the Soviets . The Soviets might decide to take advantage of this atmosphere and put more pressure on Turkey in an eﬀort to eliminate United States missile installations
 Turkey had to receive desperately needed military equipment as soon as possible . The Turkish government had to give the country desperately needed equipment . Turkey's military equipment is being sent to Turkey by the Turkish president .
 It became obvious that Turkey, focused on the need for self-defence, would not be eager to dismantle the Jupiter base . Turkey is focused on self defence, not wanting to dismantle its Jupiter base, it became obvious .
 Kennedy’s message began by reaﬃrming the solidarity of American commitments to Turkey . Kennedy emphasized that the United States would make no bargain of any kind without Turkish agreement .
 He made assurances that the bases in Turkey and Cuba were not comparable, despite his prior acceptance of the analogy .
 Kennedy was concerned about the possibility that it might bring increased hazard to Turkey in the event of a necessary extension of U.S. military action against Cuba . Kennedy: "What concerned Kennedy about the Soviet announcement?"
 In such circumstances, the President saw a real possibility of an immediate reprisal by the Soviet Union against Turkey or the bases there . The President saw the possibility of a real reprisal against Turkey .
 Kennedy said he would understand and equally respect a Turkish refusal to alter the existing situation . In this situation, Kennedy said, he would also understand a Turkish decision to render nuclear weapons on its soil inoperable during the Cuban crisis .
 Turkish President was prepared to commit a Polaris submarine at once to the Eastern Mediterranean for the protection of Turkish soil . If the Turkish government should be interested in the last alternative, the submarine would be deployed at once .
 The President told Hare that Finletter’s suggestion regarding the MLF was relevant, and stressed the fact that these longer range considerations should not be presented to the Turks at once, unless considering them might be helpful .
 The President’s immediate aim was to give the Turks a chance to make their own judgements about a foreign threat . President's immediate aim is to allow the Turks to make a decision about the threat .
 In one sense, the U.S. and the USSR were on the brink of nuclear war, in part because of the obsolete missiles in Turkey . The United States and the Soviet Union were on brink of war, but in one sense .
 Khrushchev had already told the world that the reason for the Soviet missile installation in Cuba was the Jupiter missiles in Turkey . If the US agreed to remove the bases in Turkey, the problem might be easily solved .
 Khrushchev’s proposal regarding the Cuba–Turkey missiles had already been announced . In other words, the proposal was already announced . The proposal had been announced in the 1950s .
 Kennedy’s diﬃculty in responding to the Khrushchev proposal lay in its timing and the way that it was announced on the radio . Kennedy's response to the proposal was in the timing of the proposal and its way announced .
 The United States would withdraw the blockade and guarantee no invasion of Cuba in return for the Soviets’ dismantling of the missiles . The U.S. would pull back the blockade in exchange for the dismantling of missiles, the U.N. says .
 The U.S. agreed to the Soviet demand that missiles in Turkey be dismantled within four to ﬁve months . The deal was made on condition that only a few people knew of the deal .
 The way Khrushchev made his proposal gave no opportunity for Kennedy to talk privately with the Turks about the missiles . Kennedy was not able to talk to the Turks privately about the missile issue .
 He did not dare to take the risk of appearing to yield to the Soviet demand . "He didn't want to appear to yield," he said .
 France did not want to risk Charles de Gaulle blaming him for selling out his ally in his own interests, if the trade-oﬀ on Turkey were made public .
 Turkish government wanted to dispel misunderstanding that Turkey had been at fault when the dangers arose . Turkish government discussed the matter with its allies to dispel the misunderstanding . Turkey wants to dispel that Turkey is at fault by discussing the matter .
 Turkey instructed its permanent representative in NATO to urgently request a special session of the North Atlantic Council to review the events that had led up to the IRBM’s existence in Turkey . Turkey emphasized that the IRBMs were placed in Turkey not merely for its defence, but also for
 At this point, American oﬃcials again reassured Turkey that there had been no deal regarding Turkey . The U.S. assured Turkey that the deal had not been made with Turkey .
 It remains unclear whether Turkish oﬃcials knew or at least guessed that a trade-oﬀ regarding the Turkish missiles was made in the course of US–Soviet negotiation during the crisis .
 Rijov most likely raised the matter with Erkin in Ankara, Erkin says . "This matter was most probably raised by Rijev to Erkin," Erkin writes .
 Khrushchev agreed to the removal of missiles in Cuba in return for the American removal of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey . The same sources stated that Khrushvic had agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal .
 The removal of the Jupiter missiles took on a particular urgency in the Department of State . Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defence, directed that the missiles be moved from Italy and Turkey by no later than May 1963 .
 McNamara told the State Department that this move would require almost immediate initial approaches to NATO and preparatory steps to be taken with the Italians and Turks . McNamara said the move would need almost immediate .
 McNamara’s early removal plan was opposed by some bureaucrats in the Department of Defence and Department of State . McNamara was opposed to the plan by some of his colleagues .

 The Jupiter missiles were expensive for the Turks as well as for the Americans in terms of trained manpower and money . The missiles cost the Turks and the U.S. as much as a million dollars .

 Any future U.S. military aid programme for Turkey would aﬀect the modernization of the Turkish armed forces . One critical element in the success of the Wood Mission in these contexts was the nature of the aid programme .
