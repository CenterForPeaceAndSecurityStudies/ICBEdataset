 Frontpage Interviews guest today is Lt. Programmed to Kill . Jamie Glazov is the son of a serial killer .
 Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest ranking intelligence official ever to have defected from the Soviet bloc, defected to Romania . He was the highest-ranking intelligence official in Romania to defect from the USSR .
 In 1989, Romania's president Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed at the end of a trial where most of the accusations had come word-for-word from Pacepa's book, Red Horizons, republished in 27 countries . In 1989 the president and his
 Pacepa had direct knowledge of the KGBs ties to Oswald . He also had access to newly disclosed KGB documents . He says he had direct access to new KGB documents.
 Tell us a bit about your own personal expertise in terms of this subject and the recently declassified evidence you have seen . Tell us what you know about the declassified documents you've seen .
 Moscow admitted nothing to us, the leaders of the Soviets surrogate intelligence services, about any involvement in the Kennedy assassination . Moscow, of course, admitted nothing, to us .
 For 15 years of my other life at the top of the Soviet bloc intelligence community, I was involved in a world-wide disinformation effort aimed at diverting attention away from the KGB’s involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald, the American Marine who defected to Moscow, killed President Kennedy
 "We launched rumors, published articles and even produced books insinuating that the culprits were in the U.S., not in the Soviet Union," she says . "The culprits are in the United States," she adds. "They are not in Russia, they are in America
 A note addressed to Hunt, dated November 8, 1963 and signed by Oswald, turned up in the U.S. in 1975 . The ultimate proof was a note addressed by Oswald to Hunt . copies of the note were found in 1975, copies of which turned up
 Conspiracy theorists connected it to the CIA’s E Howard Hunt, by then well known from Watergate affair, and used it to prove that the CIA was implicated in the Kennedy assassination . We knew the note was faked, but American graphological experts certified that it
 Original KGB documents in the Mitrokhin Archive, brought to light in the 1990s, finally proved that the note was forged by the KGB during the Watergate scandal . Original documents from the archive finally proved the forged note was a hoax .
 The forged note was twice checked for authenticity by the KGBs Technical Operations Directorate and approved for use . It was then approved by the Kremlin for use in the country .
 After the Soviet Union collapsed, I hoped the new leaders in Moscow might reveal the KGB hand in the Kennedy assassination . After the collapse of the USSR, I wanted to see if the KGB had been involved .
 In the 1990s, retired KGB officer Vasily Mitrokhin smuggled ca 25,000 pages of highly confidential KGB documents out of Moscow . The documents were helped by the British MI6, who smuggled them out .
 The FBI described the Mitrokhin Archive as the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source . Nevertheless, the FBI described it as the most complete intelligence ever from a source . The archive is believed to contain more than 1,000 pages .
 The books author, Joachim Joesten, spent five days in Dallas after the assassination, then went to Europe and disappeared from sight . He spent the day in Dallas, Texas, then returned to Europe .
 Carlo Aldo Marzani received $80,000 from the KGB to produce pro-Soviet books, plus an annual $10,000 to advertise them aggressively . A few months later Joestens book was published by American communist Carlo Aldozani . Carlo Marz
 Documents in the Mitrokhin Archive identify the first American reviewer of this book, Victor Perlo, as an undercover KGB operative . Other documents in the Archive identify Perlo as a KGB agent .
 In 1966 Lane published the bestseller Rush to Judgment, alleging that Kennedy was killed by a right-wing American group . Lane's book Rush To Judgment was published in 1966 . Lane also alleged that Kennedy's death was the result of an assassination by a group .
 These two books encouraged people with any remotely related background expertise to join the fray . The two books were written by people with remotely related backgrounds .
 All accused elements in the United States of that crime . Each viewed events from his own perspective, but all viewed events differently .
 New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison arrested a local man, whom he accused of conspiring with elements of U.S. intelligence to murder Kennedy in order to stop the latter's efforts to end the Cold War . Garrison accused the local man of conspiring to kill Kennedy .
 In April 1977 KGB chairman Yury Andropov informed the Politburo that the KGB was launching a new desinformatsiya campaign to further implicate American special services in the Kennedy assassination . According to another document, the KGB chairman said the campaign was launching
 The Mitrokhin Archive is silent on the subject after that . Unfortunately, the archive is silent .
 Documents written by Lee Harvey Oswald suggest he was linked to the KGB's department for assassination abroad . Oswald had returned to the U.S. from the Soviet Union only temporarily, on a mission . Oswald's documents suggest he had returned only temporarily to the United States .
 Two federal investigations and over 2,500 books have looked into the assassination . No one has raised this matter, but no one has ever raised it .
 The FBI recently told the U.S. Congress that only a native Arabic speaker could catch the fine points of an al-Qaida telephone intercept . The FBI told the United States Congress that such a native Arab speaker can catch intelligence doubletalk .
 In 1955, when I became a foreign intelligence officer, I was informed that from then on my name would be Mihai Podeanu . I remained until 1978 when I broke with communism . In 1978, I remained with communism until 1978, when he broke with it .
 "All my subordinatesand the rest of the Soviet bloc foreign intelligence officersused codes in their written reports, when talking with their sources, and even in conversations with their own colleagues. All my subordinates’s use codes in writing reports and when talking to their sources
 When I left Romania for good, my espionage service was the university, the countrys leader was the .Architect, the country’s leader . Vienna was Videle, and so on. Vienna was –V
 In intelligence and counterintelligence only the man who is heading these services knows everything . Only the head of these services can know everything, says David Cameron .
 During my last ten years in Romania I also managed the country's equivalent of NSA . I became familiar with the code systems used throughout the Soviet bloc intelligence community .
 Oswald was sent to the U.S. on a temporary mission, and planned to return to the Soviet Union after accomplishing his task . Oswald's mission was proof that he was sent on a mission to the United States, according to Oswald .
 It took me many years to sift the wheat from the chaff in going through the piles of investigative reports generated by the violent death of the young American president . When I finished I was fascinated by the wealth of KGB fingerprints all over the story of Oswald and his killer, Jack Ruby
 Oswald left his Soviet wife, Marina, just before he tried to kill American general Edwin Walker in a dry run before going on to assassinate President Kennedy . Oswald left a handwritten note in Russian just before trying to kill a general .
 He stresses that she should contact the embassy, that they have friends here, and that the Red Cross will help her financially .
 Marina did not mention this note to U.S. authorities after Oswalds arrest . Marina didn't mention the note to United States authorities . Oswald's arrest is noteworthy .
 Marina was staying with a friend with whom she was staying at the time of the assassination . It was found at the home of Ruth Paine, the friend of Marina's American friend .
 Oswald secretly met an officer of the KGB's assassination department in Mexico City just a few weeks before shooting President Kennedy . Oswald's book says Oswald met the officer just weeks before the shooting . Oswald was a member of the assassination department .
 A tangible one is the letter he sent to the Soviet embassy in Washington a few days after meeting Kostin in Mexico City . The letter is a letter from the Soviet Embassy in Washington .
 Oswald identified the person he had met there as Comrade Kostikov . Elsewhere Oswald identified a person he'd met as ‘Comrade Kostikova’
 A handwritten draft of that letter was found among Oswalds effects after the assassination . The draft of it was found in Oswald�'s effects .
 Oswald re-wrote that letter several times before typing it on her typewriter . Ruth Paine testified that Oswald wrote the letter on a typewriter several times . Oswald's wife testified that the letter was written several times by Oswald .
 Oswald's final letter to the Soviet embassy was recovered by the Warren Commission . A photocopy of the final letter Oswald sent to the embassy in Moscow was recovered . Oswald's last letter was a letter from the Soviet Embassy .
 I was unable to remain in Mexico indefinily because of my mexican visa restrictions which was for 15 days only . I was able to stay in Mexico but my visa restrictions were only 15 days .
 Oswald did not use his real name to obtain his Mexican visa . Oswald used the name "Oswold" to obtain the visa, which he used to obtain .
 Oswald’s letter is juxtaposed with the free guide book Esta Semana-This Week, September 28  October 4, 1963, and a Spanish-English dictionary, both found among Oswalds effects . Now lett juxtapose this combined letter against
 The guide book has the Soviet embassy’s telephone number underlined, the names Kosten and Osvald noted in Cyrillic on the page listing Diplomats in Mexico, and check marks next to five movie theaters on the previous page .
 The Palace of Fine Arts is a favorite place for tourists to watch the Ballet Folklórico . Also marked on Oswalds map is the Palace of Artworks .
 Oswald claimed he was not observed at the Soviet embassy at any time during his stay in Mexico City . The CIA had surveillance cameras trained on the entrance to the embassy at that time .
 Oswald resorted to an unscheduled or iron meetingzheleznaya yavka in Russian for an urgent talk with Kostikov in Mexico City . Oswald's actions suggest that he resorted to a meeting with the Russian president . Oswald is believed
 The iron meeting was a standard KGB procedure for emergency situations, iron meaning ironclad or invariable . The meeting was standard KGB procedures for emergencies .
 In his day I approved quite a few iron meetings in Mexico City , and Oswalds . meetingiron meeting looks to be a typical one, he says . Oswald: "I approve quite a lot of meetings"
 Of course, I cannot be sure that everything happened exactly that wayevery case officer had his own quirks .
 On the following Tuesday, still in Mexico City, he telephoned the Soviet embassy from the Cuban embassy . He asked the guard on duty to connect him with Comrade Kostikov with whom he had talked on September 28 .
 Every communist party was managed by a Soviet-style politburo . All Soviet bloc armies wore the same uniform, every East European police force was replaced by a militia . Every East Eastern police force in the Soviet bloc was replaced with a Soviet militia .
 Yes, Soviet intelligence, like the Soviet government, had a strong penchant for patterns . Yes, yes, yes. Soviet intelligence .
 By its very nature espionage is an arcane and duplicitous undertaking, but in the hands of the Soviets it developed into a whole philosophy . Every aspect of which had its own set of tried and true rules and followed a prescribed pattern .
 Oswald’s experiences as a Marine serving in Japan, for instance, fit the PGU template for recruiting American servicemen outside the U.S. that I for many years had applied to Romanian operations. Oswalds experiences in Japan fit the template for recruitment .
 Oswald used a bus terminal in 1959 to deposit a duffel bag stuffed with photographs of U.S. military planes . The locker at the bus terminal Oswald used in 1959 was in fact an intelligence dead drop . Oswald used the locker after returning to the United States from Japan .
 Soviet espionage operations can be isolated out by their patterns, if you are familiar with them . The patterns of Soviet espionage patterns can be found out by looking at them closely .
 Counterintelligence experts call these patterns operational evidence, showing the fingerprints of the perpetrator . Counterintelligence expert: These patterns are ‘operational . evidence’ of the perpetrators .
 That was Soviet dezinformatsyiadisseminated by my DIE as well, at KGB behest . That was also Soviet Dezinformatatyia’s dissemination .
 Oswald knew the flight altitude of the CIA's super-secret U-2 spy planes flying over the Soviet Union from Atsugi Air Base in Japan . Oswald was a radar operator at Atsugai Air Base .
 In 1959, when I was chief of Romania’s intelligence station in West Germany, a Soviet requirement sent to me asked for everything, including rumors, about the flight altitude of the U-2 planes . In 1959 the requirement was asked for information about flight altitude
 The Soviet Defense Ministry knew that U-2 planes had flown over the Soviet Union several times, but its Air Defense Command had not been able to track them because the Soviet radars of those days did not reach ultra-high altitudes .
 Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot whom the Soviets shot down on May 1, 1960, believed that the Soviets were able to get him because Oswald had provided them with the altitude of his flight . Powers was the U.2 pilot who was shot down by the Soviets .
 Oswald had access to radar, radio codes and height at which the U-2 flew, Powers says . The height at that height was one of the most highly classified secrets . Oswald also knew how to use the new MPS-16 height-finding radar gear .
 Oswald, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, was one of the people in the audience attending Powerss trial in Moscow . Powers’s spectacular trial was held in Moscow, Russia .
 He seemed to be a nice, bright american-type fellow, when I saw him in Moscow . He was a nice American-type, when he was in Moscow, he said . He said .
 Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected to the U.S. in 1964, says he's surprised that such a big deal is made of the fact that he was a Marine .
 A KGB domestic department member knew nothing about PGU foreign sources . He belonged to a middle level FBI agent who would know nothing about CIA sources abroad . But he belonged to the KGB domestic division .
 Recruiting low-ranking American servicemen was one of the PGUs highest priorities in those days . Recruitment was also a priority for the U.S. military .
 Hunting for a serzhant was my top priority during the three years I was assigned as rezident in West Germany . It was still a top priority in 1978, when I broke with Communism . Hunting for the 'serzhants' was still an important priority
 Of course the PGU would have liked to recruit American colonels, but they were difficult to approach . Low-ranking officers were more accessible and could provide excellent information if given guidance .
 In the 1950s he was stationed abroad where, like Oswald, he became infatuated with communism . He was also a fan of the Communist Party .
 In 1953 Johnson surreptitiously entered a Soviet military unit in East Berlin, where he asked to be granted political asylum . Johnson asked for political asylum in the 'workers' paradise .
 Johnson secretly awarded the rank of Red Army major and received written congratulations from Khrushchev himself . Johnson was secretly awarded a Soviet rank of major by the Red Army .
 Vitaly Yurchenko defected to the CIA in 1985 and soon redefected . U.S. Chief Warrant Officer John Anthony Walker was the greatest agent in PGU history, he says .
 Oswald returned from the Soviet Union in 1962 with a 13-page document entitled Historic Diary . In 1962, Oswald returned with him a document entitled ‘historic Diary.’
 The term was introduced by General Aleksandr Sakharovsky, a former Soviet chief adviser to Romania�s Securitate . General Sakharov rose to head the PGU for an unprecedented 14 years .
 The Securitate had the historic task to weed out the bourgeoisie from the Romanian soil, as he constantly preached at us, he said . It was a historic task, he wrote, to weed-out the bourgeoisie .
 The historic duty of the PGU was to dig the grave of the international bourgeoisie. The . historic duty of the . PGU, the . ‘historic duty” was to . dig the . grave of . the international . bourgeoisie, he said
 Khrushchev had launched that famous slogan of his about catching up with the West and overtaking it in the space of ten years . Dogonyat i peregonyat was our monumentalnaya, historic task, he told us .
 All our illegal officers and agents sent to the West under a fictitious biography had to take along some kind of written memory aid, so that they could remember exactly where they had supposedly been when, and what they had done in various periods of their alleged lives .
 Up to the end of the 1950s, these notes had been taken abroad in the form of microdots or on soft film concealed in some everyday object . But of course they presented the potential risk of becoming incriminating evidence if ever found .
 In January 1959 Sakharovsky ordered all Soviet bloc foreign intelligence services to conceal their biographies in the form of diaries, drafts of books, personal letters or autobiographical notes . In the same month, he ordered the KGB to conceal those biographies .
 The notes were drafted by disinformation specialists, copied out by hand by the illegal or intelligence agent concerned, usually just before leaving for the West, and then carried across the border openly . These notes are drafted by a disinformation specialist and copied out before leaving the West .
 A microscopic examination of Oswalds Historic Diary did indeed show that it was written in one or two sessions.’ It was written by Oswald in a single session, according to a microscopic examination . Oswald’s diary was found to have
 The evidence suggests Oswald lost PGU support, and that he went alone to kill President Kennedy . In the end, you find that the evidence suggests that Oswald lost support, says CNN's Tom Charity .
 In October 1962, the West German Supreme Court mounted a public trial of Bogdan Stashinsky . He had been decorated by Khrushchev for having assassinated enemies of the Soviet Union living in the West .
 This trial revealed Khrushchev to the world as a callous political butcher . This trial was revealed to world as callous, callous and callous .
 By 1963 the once flamboyant Soviet dictator was already a crippled ruler gasping for air . By 1963 he had already been crippled by the collapse of his regime .
 The slightest whiff of any Soviet involvement in the assassination of the U.S. president could have been fatal to Khrushchev . "The slightest whiff" of Soviet involvement was fatal to the Soviet leader, says historian .
 The KGB banned all operations aimed at assassinating enemies in the West . Thus, as did my DIE, the KGB canceled all operations .
 Oswald shot at American general Edwin Walker to prove he could carry out assigned assassination . Oswald narrowly missed Walker, but was able to carry out the assignment .
 Oswald put together a package, complete with photographs, showing how he had planned this operation, and then he took this material to Mexico City to show his case officer what he could do . Oswald took the package to show Kostin, the president's case officer, what he had done
 Moscow refused to identify Walker as the man who pulled off the Walker assassination attempt without being identified as the perpetrator . Moscow remained adamant that Walker was the man responsible for the attempt .
 The stubborn Oswald was devastated, but in the end he went ahead on his own . Oswald was utterly convinced he was fulfilling his historic task. He went ahead with his plan .
 He had done his best to obtain weapons in an inconspicuous way and to fabricate identity documents, using the tradecraft the KGB had taught him . He was just 24 years old, and he had obtained weapons in a discreet way .
 Up until the very end he also followed the emergency instructions he had originally been given by the KGBadmit nothing and ask for a lawyer . The KGB had told him to stay quiet, not admit anything and ask a lawyer, he says .
 Oswald already knew too much about the original plan, however, Moscow arranged for him to be silenced forever, if he should go on to commit the unthinkable . Oswald was silenced if he knew enough of the plan to kill Oswald . Oswald's assassination was the first assassination attempt in American history .
 Seven chiefs of the Soviet political police itself were secretly or openly assassinated to prevent them from incriminating the Kremlin . Seven chiefs were assassinated in order to prevent the Kremlin incriminating them .
 Moscow launched Operation Dragon, a disinformation effort in which my service was deeply involved . Immediately upon news of Kennedys assassination Moscow launched a disinformation campaign .
 The aim was to throw the blame on various elements in the United States for killing their own president . The aim has succeeded only too wellwas to blame various elements .
 Programmed to Kill is based on old intelligence anecdotes and offers no convincing Soviet motives for the assassination . A first review of the book by Publishers Weekly said it was based on 'old intelligence'
 Ceausescu was executed at the end of a trial whose accusations came almost word-for-word out of Red Horizons . Red Horizons is still in print, two years later Ceauscu was finally executed .
 People remember Stalin as a down-to-earth peasant who corrected the evils of Stalin . Today, people remember him as a 'down to the earth' peasant .
 The Khrushchev I knew was bloody, brash and extroverted, and he tended to destroy every project once he got his hands on it . He was 'bloody and brash' and 'extroverted', says former Soviet leader .
 Khrushchevs irrationality made him the most controversial and unpredictable Soviet leader . He was the most unpredictable and unpredictable leader of Soviet Union .
 He unmasked Stalin's crimes, but he made political assassination a main instrument of his own foreign policy . He made political assassinations a main tool of his foreign policy, he says .
 He authored a policy of peaceful coexistence with the West, but he ended up pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war . He pushed the world toward the brink by pushing it to a nuclear brink of war .
 He concluded the first agreement for the control of nuclear arms . But he tried to secure Fidel Castro's position at the helm of Cuba with the help of nukes . He also concluded the agreement with the Cuban government .
 He repaired Moscow's relations with Yugoslavia's Tito, but he broke those with Beijing . He also destroyed the unity of the Communist world . He broke those ties with Beijing and thereby destroyed unity .
 On September 11, 1971 Khrushchev died in ignominy, as a non-person, although not before seeing his memoirs published in the West giving his own version of history . His memoirs gave his own account of his life .
 Gen Ion Mihai Pacepa, thank you kindly for joining Frontpage Interview . Gen Ion Pacepea: "I'm not afraid to say yes. I'm very proud to be a Romanian."
 "Your book serves as yet another reminder of the evil nature of the KGB and the truly dark and sinister entity that we faced in the Soviet regime," author says .
 "I greatly appreciate your courage in being willing to debate this controversial subject. I greatly appreciate you courage," he said .

 The Inside Story Of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev , 462. The inside story of the Soviet Union's foreign policy is told in a book published by the U.S. government .
 The article did not seem clear on the Kremlin’s initial interest in killing Kennedy . It was unclear on the original interest .
 I can postulate that Krushchev felt angry after the Missile Crisis, and that that was sufficient reason . I can also postulate . I'm not sure what happened to the missile crisis .
 After the Missile Crisis, Krushchev was on a fairly short leash, Breshnev was ascendant, among others . But after the crisis, he was put on a relatively short leash .
 They had far less at stake with respect to Kennedy, and would presumably have known about such goings on . Would presumably have been responsible for authorizing or countermanding such plans .
 Childs was in Moscow during November 1963 and overheard conversations concerning Kennedy’s death . Childs overheard conversations about Kennedy's death in Moscow .
 KGB rules allowed only photocopies of counterfeited documents to be used, to avoid close examination of the original’s .

 "It takes a Perry Mason type to figure out the creditable evidence and disinformation," says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 I don't think Oswald was a “Manchurian Candidate” type agent. Free ThinkerNY I don’t think . Oswald was not a Manchurian . Candidate’s role in the U.S. has been questioned .
 The Soviets were as curious about who could have killed Kennedy as we were. Pelham Pelham: "The Soviets were curious" about who killed Kennedy . Pelham was as curious as the Soviets were.
 Kerry's family history of opium running into China probably plays a role in this also . Kerry has a history of running opium into China as a child .
 Consider the number of persons only remotely connected to the assassination who were dead, many under curious circumstances by 1966 . Consider the fact that many of them were dead by 1966, many of those who were not connected .
