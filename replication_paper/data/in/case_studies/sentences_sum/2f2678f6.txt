 Before the crisis, there had been talk in the Kennedy administration of invading Cuba, assassinating Fidel Castro, and other actions against Cuba and its Communist leadership . The failed Bay of Pigs invasion made Cuba very wary of the United States . So, in a way, the Kennedy .
 For approximately fifty years the two counties faced off, each trying to achieve dominance over the other . The two counties have been battling for dominance over each other for over 50 years .
 Both nations were in possession of nuclear weapons . For a time, the end of the world was literally at the hands of a select group of political leaders .
 For years, people lived with the imposing specter of nuclear annihilations . For many years, we have lived in the shadow of a nuclear apocalypse .
 Families built bomb shelters beneath their houses and children were taught how to hopefully survive a nuclear attack . Families built a bomb shelter beneath their homes and children learned how to prepare for an attack .
 Decades of living in a hyper paranoid state where every day was potentially the last were rewarded by the end of the Cold War . The Cold War ended without a single shot being fired .

 The fall out of the incident according to aymond L Garthoff was that the Soviet Union was miffed and would never attempt another arms race, especially in Cuba .
 Only in 1970 did the public become aware of the tacit understanding between both sides of the line .

 The crisis or what most people refer to as a crucial part of the Cold War at the time, primarily happened in October 1962 . The crisis was the first time the U.S. was involved in a major crisis in the world's Cold War .
 The U.S. government had tried to overthrow the Cuban government prior to the clash . The Bay of Pigs and Operation Mongoose were among the incidents that led to the Bay of the Pigs .
 This was done due to the fact that the Cuban and Soviet government authorities had privately started to construct bases in Cuba for several medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles . The bases were built in Cuba to protect the United States from the threat posed by the Cuban government .
 What actually transpired during those fateful days in October 1962 is just now filtering out the U.S. general public . It remains unclear whether the people of the former Soviet Union have ever been told the complete story .
 Given the highly secretive nature of the Soviet regimen during this period in history, it is unlikely that many average citizens were aware of the existence of the secret operation .

 The crisis was averted when Khrushchev, also wary of the danger of a nuclear confrontation, announced on October 28 that he would remove missiles from Cuba in return for a U.S. pledge not to invade .
 The Cuban missile crisis was the closest that the United States And the U.S. came to a nuclear war during the Cold War period . The Cuban crisis occurred during the 1950s and '60s .
 This provides us with an imperative to undermine Khrushchev's conceptions that we are indecisive or that we're unwilling to make the sacrifices implicated by a full-scale confrontation with the Soviets . The U.S. should not be afraid to confront the Soviets, writes David Cameron .
 On the other hand, we must also strike a balance whereby these sacrifices are not necessary . We must strike a balancing place where sacrifices are necessary, but not necessary, says the author .
