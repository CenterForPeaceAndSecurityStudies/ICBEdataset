 U.S. intelligence was unaware that along with the SS-4s, the Soviet Union had also sent more than a hundred shorter-range ""tactical"" nuclear missiles to Cuba .
 The SS-4s weren't mentioned in the SovietUnited States agreement on withdrawing from Cuba, so technically Khrushchev had not promised to remove them from Cuba . They were not mentioned .
 Fidel Castro was in a rage about having been abandoned by his Soviet allies, so Khrushchev decided to let him keep the tactical missiles . To mollify him he was allowed to keep the missiles .
 The second half of the crisis, invisible to Americans, was Mikoyan's month-long struggle to pry Castro's fingers off the hundred tactical nuclear missiles .
 In the end, he only succeeded by telling Castro that an unpublished law forbade the transfer of Soviet nuclear weapons to a foreign country . In the 1990s, the Soviet Union did not have nuclear weapons .
