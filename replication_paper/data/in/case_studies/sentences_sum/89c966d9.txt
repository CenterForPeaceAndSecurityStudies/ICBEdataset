 The filmmakers apparently decided that the conventional explanation was less complicated and made a more dramatic story . The filmmakers decided to make a dramatic choice .
 Even among historians and ExComm participants, the Trollope Ploy remains an all but immovable fixture in the legend and lore of the Cuban missile crisis .
 Ted Sorensen, an ExComm participant, had suggested in 1965 that JFK himself had “decided to treat the latest letter as propaganda and to concentrate on the Friday night letter” and had delegated RFK and Sorenen to come up with the right wording
 Sorensen did not challenge Bobby Kennedy's claim to have first suggested this strategy . Thirteen Days was published in 1969 after RFK’s assassination .
 Some controversy has continued about who actually initiated the Trollope Ploy . Some controversy over who initiated the trollope ploy .
 Some ExComm participants and scholars have suggested that Llewellyn Thompson, former Ambassador to Moscow, came up with the idea . Thompson was ambassador to Moscow .
 Others have pointed to National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy or Assistant Secretary of State Edwin Martin .
 President Kennedy himself seized on the political benefit in this explanation of the settlement of the crisis . The agreement to remove the U.S. missiles from Turkey was just that—top secret, and remained so for decades .
 JFK phoned former Presidents Eisenhower, Truman and Hoover hours after Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles . JFK deliberately misinformed them about the removal of the missiles from the Soviet Union .
 Khrushchev offered to remove the missiles if the U.S. pulled its Jupiter missiles out of Turkey . He accurately reported that Khruschev, on Friday, had privately suggested withdrawing the missiles in exchange for an American promise not to invade Cuba .
 Eisenhower asked if the Soviets had tried to attach any other conditions . Eisenhower, who had dealt personally with Khrushchev, asked skeptically if the conditions had been any other .
 The Trollope Ploy was indelibly fixed in public consciousness by the 1974 television film, “The Missiles of October,” based on RFK’s book . Such deceptions shaped the administration's cover story, and helped generate the notion of the Trollope
 The idea of the Trollope Ploy was invented to conceal the real agreement to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey . In fact, listening carefully to the recently declassified ExComm tapes proves conclusively that the idea was invented .
 Lincoln dashed off the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope . It is a myth; it simply did not happen that way . Lincoln's Gettysburg address was not delivered back to Gettysburg .
 JFK speculated, “He may be putting out another letter,” and called in press secretary Pierre Salinger . JFK speculated that JFK may have sent a letter to his press secretary .
 We're gonna be in an insupportable position on this matter if this becomes his proposal . We’re going to be in a position if this proposal becomes his . We're not sure if it will happen .

 JFK read a news ticker report which confirmed Khrushchev’s new public offer to link missiles in Cuba and Turkey . Salinger soon brought in a news report which JFK read aloud .
 President Kennedy recognized immediately that Rusk’s wording did not reflect his persistent stance on pursuing a Turkey-Cuba trade . Rusk appeared to be trying to be a rather transparent end run around his position .
 “Let’s not kid ourselves,” he repeated for the third time, ‘that’�s the difficulty,’ he said . ‘That’ is the difficulty. Let’t kid ourselves.”
 JFK: NATO should put enough pressure on the Turks to pressure NATO . JFK: If the Turks were adamant, NATO should pressure NATO to pressure the Turks . The Turks are adamant, JFK said .

 The group agreed that RFK should warn Dobrynin that military action against Cuba was imminent . The U.S. prepared to pledge not to invade Cuba if missiles were withdrawn, the group agreed .
 President Obama continued to press for a deal on the Turkish missiles . But, he also continued to push for the deal .
 Rusk suggested that RFK advise the ambassador that a public quid pro quo for the missiles in Turkey was unacceptable, but JFK was prepared to remove them once the Cuban crisis was resolved . Rusk, finally recognizing JFK’s determination, suggested advising the ambassador .
 Robert Kennedy was instructed to tell Dobrynin that any Soviet reference to this secret proposal would make it null and void . Kennedy was told that any reference to the proposal would be made null . The proposal was made to the Soviet Union in the 1960s .
 JFK worked secretly with Rusk to put together another fall-back plan . JFK had no faith in the strategy of accepting Khrushchev’s Friday offer and ignoring public Saturday message .
 The secretary of state arranged to have former deputy UN Secretary General Andrew Cordier put in place an emergency back channel strategy by which U.S. and the United States would mutually agree to remove their missiles from Turkey and Cuba . Cordier would then announce a UN plan through which the U
 JFK was prepared to gamble that if the U.S. publicly accepted this supposedly neutral plan, it would be very difficult for the Soviets to reject it . JFK: "If the United States . accepted this . plan, the Soviets would reject it," JFK said .
 Khrushchev’s unexpected decision the following morning made the Cordier gambit moot . Rusk did not reveal this closely-held secret for over twenty-five years . The following morning, Khrushchev's unexpected decision .
 Listening to the October 27 meeting tapes proves that ExComm participants and scholars have read far too much cunning and coherence into the discussion of the Trollope Ploy . The meeting tapes prove that scholars and ExComm members have read too much into the discussions .
 President Kennedy insisted that Khrushchev’s Saturday offer could not be ignored because it had been made public . President Kennedy, as the tapes document, stubbornly and persistently, insisted . Kennedy: "It was a mistake"

 Robert Kennedy did tirelessly press his brother not to give up on Khrushchev’s Friday proposal . Robert Kennedy pressed his brother to keep up with the proposal . The proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union in 1956 .
 JFK, although skeptical and reluctant, finally agreed to try this scheme . JFK repeatedly predicted that the Soviet leader would inevitably “come back” to his public offer on the Turkish missiles . JFK, however, was skeptical .
 The president had no illusions about forcing Khrushchev to settle for the terms in his earlier message . The president assented to this strategy largely to placate unyielding ExComm opposition .
 JFK was determined not to allow this chance to avert nuclear catastrophe slip away . RFK’s meeting with Dobrynin and the other secret steps taken later that day were kept from much of the ExComm . JFK would not let this chance slip away, RFK says .
 President Kennedy’s inclination to pursue the Turkish option actually seems to have hardened in response to the dogged intractability of his advisers at the October 27 meetings . In fact, President Kennedy's inclination to pursuing the Turkish . option actually appears to have softened .

 "Llewellyn Thompson certainly certainly certainly worked," says Bundy . Bundy's account is not corroborated by the definitive primary source—the ExComm tapes . Bundy: "The President certainly certainly ... might actually work"
 My musings about records being more reliable than lore and the difficulties faced by government archivists may seem somewhat obscure . Maarja .
 I have assumed readers would see the link to the Stern article, but on reflection, I have decided I need to be more explicit . The Stern article was published in Stern magazine on Sunday .
 The Trollope Ploy remains an all but immovable fixture in the legend and lore of the Cuban missile crisis . Stern writes, "Even among historians and ExComm participants"
 Stern mentions leaks from the Kennedy brothers which contributed to the myths . Stern mentions the leaks from Kennedy brothers . Stern also mentions the myths surrounding the Kennedy family .
 As an historian and a former archivist, I know how difficult it is to release records about controversial issues, especially if the information contradicts memoirs or myths . As an ex-archivist, she says it is difficult to release information about controversial topics .
 President Kennedy had not died prematurely and if Robert F Kennedy still were alive, the government would have been forced to release records about the crisis .
 As late as the 1980s, Nixon's lawyers appear to have had the impression that the Kennedy library was selective in its release of historical information . Nixon's defense attorney says the library is selective .
 Richard Nixon's lawyers asked for a selective veto over what could be released from his records, a House subcommittee discovered . Nixon lawyers had gone to the Department of Justice to ask for selective veto . The National Archives struggled to screen Nixon's records during the 1980s .
 Presidential papers are administered under several different laws . Pre-Watergate Presidents and their families have the most power, on paper, to influence access to papers .
 I believe some of the difficulties with public control of Presidential papers relate to the relatively short restriction periods. I believe the difficulties are to be solved by a relatively short period of time .
 Mr Stern, I apologize for misinterpreting your point. Arnold Shcherban: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I misinterpreted my point. I apologize."
 By Soviet party leadership time-scale that normally equaled life-span, two years is a very short time . Two years was a short time for a Soviet party leader, according to reports .
 Historians often focus on what records reveal about myths . Few have focused on post-Watergate changes in record keeping or what it takes to release records . Historians focus on how records reveal myths about myths, but few have looked at post-war records .
 Nigel Hamilton writes about his problems in getting access to records at the Kennedy Library . The Kennedy Library records are available at the library .
 Kessler: Depository supposedly censors material because it detracts from Kennedy image . Kessler: "Censors material" because it "distorts the Kennedy image" Kessler: The depository's censorship is a violation of the law .
 There is a problem of diminished record keeping in the post-Watergate era and how lack of records may make it harder to unravel myths in the future . And then there is the problem of record keeping .
 Public figures no longer write the kind of thoughtful, discursive letters and revealing memos that we used to see . Public figures don't write the same kind of letters and memos that they used to do .
 People in Washington are more public relations savvy than in earlier times . They are more adept at drafting memos and other records that conceal their motives and can fool historians .
 A historian of the years of Bill Clinton, George W Bush, or their successors may not have the kind of sources needed to understand who did what to whom and why as well as a scholar might for, say, Franklin Roosevelt . The result of all of this is that a historian of
 An article in the Washington Post described increased interest in story telling in federal agencies .
 Some agencies are conducting oral history interviews or encouraging senior managers to tell war stories at conferences . Concerned about losing institutional memory, some agencies have conducted oral interviews or interviews .
 It is commendable that agencies are trying to preserve institutional memory and link the past to the present . It was commendable for agencies to try and maintain institutional memory .
 While managerial war stories may be great for mentoring, they can be tricky for history . History can be difficult for managers to remember, as well as managers .
 You could no more produce history based just on storytelling than you could write about the Vietnam War using only the memoirs of Henry A Kissinger and Richard Nixon . You can't produce history using just storytelling, you can only write history based on storytelling .
 Or get to the bottom of a corporate scandal by relying only on uncorroborated oral evidence . Or rely only on the evidence of an alleged corporate scandal .
 Some story tellers may exaggerate their role in an agency's successes and shield their roles in failures . The agency's story teller may be exaggerating his role in the agency's success .
 Others may lack the ability to apply critical analysis to events in which they participated . Others may not be able to use critical analysis of events they participated in .
 Principals may have a vested interest in presenting a certain view or spin on historical events .
 Sheldon M Stern: "I find it difficult to understand how Mr Shcherban could read this article and conclude that I am being critical of JFK's decision to make the missile trade"
 Khruschev was removed from the post of General Secretary of CPSS soon after the missile crisis . The removal was largely the result of his failure to protect Soviet strategic interests and the ""soft"" stance during the crisis .
 It seems like the author made a lot of effort and research to reveal what a weak President Kennedy was, how he yielded under the Soviet pressure . Kennedy made a serious strategic and military mistake to exchange the withdrawal of the U.S. missiles from Turkey to the Soviet from Cuba .
 The missiles were considered outdated even before and regardless of the Soviet-Cuban crisis . The missiles ultimately removed from Turkey were considered largely outdated . They were considered to be outdated before and after the Cuban crisis .
 The main nuclear strike planned from the Turkey territory would be done by strategic nuclear bombers/planes the quantity of which was significantly increased in the post-crisis period of time . The main strike would be carried out from Turkey territory .
 In military-strategic sense, the United States lost practically nothing, but gained a lot, since Cuban missiles removed were the only nuclear delivery means Soviets ever had in close proximity to the U.S. territory .
 Kennedy was making allusions to the possible reaction of international community to the U.S. rejection of the proposed exchange, author says . Kennedy also made reference to possible reaction to the United States rejecting the proposal .
 If looked upon by the unbiased observer, the Soviets moved in only after the Pig's Bay invasion, organized and sponsored by the US, in order to prevent the more devastating and seemed very possible for Cubans military move coming from their neighbor .
 The Soviet citizens had not invaded Turkey, and therefore, their nuclear move had much more recent historical causality than the deployment of the United States missiles and strategic bombers in Turkey . The United States did not invade Turkey .
 The exchange was a wise move, both strategically and diplomatically, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 As far, as the Kennedy's considerations on the representation of the move to the U.S. political and ideological mainstream, I think, as a leader of American politics he had no other reasonable choice, but to create the tough-stance deception mentioned by the author .
