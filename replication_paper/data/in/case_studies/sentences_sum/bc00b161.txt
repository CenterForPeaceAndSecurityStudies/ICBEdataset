 Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality . You can watch the entire speech at C-Span .

 The most stunning moment in the interview was when Trump claimed to have done more for black Americans than any previous president, including Abraham Lincoln, including Lincoln .
 This isn't the first time Trump has claimed he’s done more for the Black community than his predecessors . This isn’t the first .
 Of course it’s not really clear what Trump was trying to say, because his speech is so incoherent . Of course, it was not clear what he was trying .

 Jackson could have come up with a 'deal' to prevent the Civil War, historian says . That statement was dangerous as it was ahistorical, but it's still dangerous, he says .

 If it’s a one-on-one for the life … Trump: "That does happen, that does happen. That does happen" Trump: If it's a one on-the-air one, it's possible that the life of the president is at risk .
 The most relevant part here isn't the president’s views on the details of self-defense tactics, but rather the lack of empathy in the way he talks about the issue . The president's views on self-defence tactics are relevant, but not the details .
 The only world in which police using chokeholds could sound “innocent” or “perfect” is a world where you don’t think about what happens to people when they’re literally being choked . You assume that it won't happen to people

 I’ve spent a bit of time recently reading books and articles about the assassination and it’s aftermath . I've spent a lot of time studying the assassination of JFK .
 I have wanted to write a post about it, but I just haven’t been able to do it . I have always wanted to talk about it. I have been unable to do so .
 For me, the JFK assassination is still a very painful issue–in fact, it has become more and more painful for me over the years as I’ve grown older and wiser and more knowledgeable about politics and history . The JFK assassination remains a painful issue for the author .
 I'm going to focus on the role of the media in defending the conclusions of the Warren Commission . I’m going to talk about the media’s role in defending Warren Commission conclusions .

 The use of chemical weapons cannot be ignored, even though the United States did just that decades ago when then-Mideast special envoy Donald Rumsfeld embraced Saddam Hussein after he deployed those heinous weapons on his own people .
 Syria must abandon its arsenal of chemical weapons that are inherently inhuman . At the very least, even if the Syrian government continues to deny responsibility for the chemical attacks, it must abandon these weapons .
 Scheer credits Russian foreign minister Sergey V Lavrov with a sudden brainstorm in response to a supposedly off-handed remark from John Kerry . Scheer says Lavrov's response to John Kerry's remark was a surprise surprise .
 Syria's foreign minister was in Moscow at the time of the phone call with Kerry and Lavrov . Syria’s foreign minister, who was visiting Moscow, welcomed the sentiment, he said .
