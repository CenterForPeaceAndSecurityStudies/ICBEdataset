 Soviet commanders were led by complex and challenging tactical circumstances, including unreliable communications and malfunctioning equipment, she says . She says .
 Almost as disturbing is the revelation that United States forces were not aware of this particular threat . U.S. forces were unaware of the threat, according to reports .
 This research reveals how a chain of inadvertent developments at sea could have precipitated global nuclear war . Underlined the extreme danger of the crisis, underlining the danger of nuclear war in the world .
 The Cuban missile crisis continues to present scholars with new puzzles and revelations . The most extensively studied crisis of the twentieth century continues to provide new insights .
 The naval aspect of the Cuban naval crisis has until recently remained one of its least researched subjects . The story of how the actual deployment of the Soviet forces to Cuba was implemented has remained a mystery for years .
 Operation ANADYR by Anatoly Gribkov and William Smith is one of the most detailed accounts of Operation AnADYR . Operation Anadyr was conducted by the Soviet Union in the 1980s and 1990s .
 The deployment of Soviet submarines to Cuba deserves special attention from scholars of the Cuban missile crisis and Cold War crises in general . However, it is not the first time Soviet submarines were deployed to Cuba .
 A limited nature of information on which actors have to rely in making their decisions under pressure quickly, perceptions of the opponent's actions as more threatening and coordinated than one’s own . The reliability of the chain of command and the impact on the presence of nuclear weapons and possible implications of
 This paper will give an overview of the submarine operations during the CMC . It will try to provide answers to the following questions . This paper draws on available evidence from Russian and American sources .
 US intelligence had suspected that it might have been protection of the Soviet transport ships or an effort to establish a Soviet naval base in one of the Cuban ports .
 We have learned from the revelations of the Soviet submarine veterans, and from documents declassiﬁed in Russia, that unbeknown to the Americans, the Soviet submarines had been . been ﬁtted with nuclear-tipped torpedoes .
 Debate over whether Soviet ground commanders had been given discretionary authority to use tactical nuclear weapons in the event of a U.S. invasion of Cuba originated with Anatoly Gribkov’s controversial statement to that effect in the tripartite Havana Conference in 1992 .
 There is now a debate over the circumstances under which the submarine commanders could have used their own tactical nuclear weapons . The question is whether the torpedoes could have been used without authorization from Moscow in conditions where contact with the center was impossible .
 A vital question is whether the presence of nuclear weapons on the submarines increased the danger of US–Soviet nuclear conﬂictict . Another vital question has broad implications for the study of crises in international relations .
 If submarine commanders could have used these torpedoes at their own discretion, one could argue that such an option added a major aspect of unpredictability to the crisis . Such an option would have added to the unpredictability of the crisis, he says .
 The nuclear torpedoes could arguably have contributed to the level of danger indirectly, through the possibility of accidental, or unintentional, inadvertent use .
 Most documents on this subject remain classiﬁed in military and naval archives in Russia . This study must begin with the disclaimer that on the Russian side, most documents on the subject remain in military archives .
 Very important Soviet documentary sources from the Presdential Archive of the Russian Federation (including the appendices to this chapter) became available to scholars as a result of a special declassiﬁcation undertaken by the Russian Presidential Archive in April 2002 .
 The author has relied on these sources and on memoirs, secondary publications, personal interviews and the minutes of a 40th Anniversary Conference on the CMC .
 This study draws on documents obtained from United States naval archives by William Burr of the National Security Archive, and the electronic brieﬁng book prepared by Thomas Blanton .
 Until recently, it was not widely known that the Soviet submarines that went to Cuba were equipped with one nuclear-tipped torpedo each . The Neverending Story .
 Peter Huchthausen’s book October Fury brought together the recollections of American and Russian participants in the confrontation on the high seas .
 The account of the Soviet submarines’ voyage and the efforts of U.S. ASW forces’ efforts to discover them and force them to the surface became front-page news .
 The document presumed creation of a new ﬂeet group, based in Cuban ports .
 The Soviet government envisioned creating a new naval base on Cuba with a substantial Soviet presence . In other words, the Soviet government wanted to create a substantial naval base .
 The squadrons would be incorporated into the Group of Soviet Forces . Upon arrival of the squadrons in Cuba, they would become part of the group of Soviet forces .
 U.S. submarines will be required to leave October 7. Arrival in Cuba was scheduled for 9 November; the passage was expected to take up to 32 days .
 The brigade consisted of four Foxtrot-class submarines, armed with 22 torpedoes each, one of which had a nuclear warhead . Among them were four nuclear warheads . The brigade was armed with 88 torpedoes, among them four with nuclear warheads.
 The submarine B-75 had 22 torpedoes with a range of 11 km, two of which had nuclear warheads . Two of the torpedoes in the submarine were nuclear warheads, the U.S. Navy says .
 Captain Nikolai Nantenkov says this was the ﬁrst case in his experience when the ammunition included nuclear warheads .
 The boat had left port in the second half of September . It was able to get to the destination undetected by closely following the three-mile boundary of U.S. territorial waters .
 The submarine stayed in the vicinity of the Soviet transports area, and was quickly recalled when the quarantine was announced . After its arrival at its destination, the submarine was recalled .
 On 22 October the B-75 was detected by NATO antisubmarine forces while refueling near the Azores . It was the first time the plane was detected in the region .
 Another submarine, the Zulu-class B-88, was dispatched on the mission in the Paciﬁc. mission . Another submarine was dispatched to the mission .
 On 28 October, it left its base at the Kamchatka peninsula with orders to sail to Pearl Harbor and attack that U.S. base if the crisis in Cuba had escalated into a US–Soviet war .
 Commanded by Captain Konstantin Kireev, the B-88 arrived near Pearl Harbor on 10 November . It patrolled the area until 14 November, when it received orders to return home .
 The orders were rescinded that same day, a sign that Moscow believed that the crisis was not over . Moscow believes that it is not over after the crisis .
 The 69th submarine brigade, which was on its way to the port of Mariel, received unexpected instructions from Moscow to reverse its direction, and to patrol positions in the Saragasso Sea .
 Commander of the Brigade Vitalii Agafonov traveled on board the B-4 and B-59 . Chief of Staff Vasilii Arkhipov traveled aboard the B4 and the B59 .
 Four Foxtrot submarines sent to Cuba carried nuclear torpedoes as part of their ammunition . Foxtrots were among the ﬁrst – if not the very ﬀrst - in their class – to carry nuclear torpedo torpedoes .
 One of these boats, B-130, took part in naval exercises in October 1961 . Captain Shumkov was for the ﬁrst time given orders to test a nuclear torpedo launch from a submerged position .
 The tests were successful, and the boat’s commander became one of very few . few submarine captains, who had experience in using this type of weapon .
 Soviet government decided to equip Foxtrot diesel submarines with nuclear torpedoes . We can only speculate why the Soviet government chose to equip them with nuclear weapons .
 Most likely the decision was made some time after the signiﬁcant reduction in the number of naval forces to be sent to Cuba . Most likely, this was made after the signing of a reduction in naval forces .
 The Soviet Navy did not have a sufﬁcient number of nuclear missile submarines ready to be sent on this assignment . The Foxtrots were equipped with nuclear warheads .
 The orders to take nuclear warheads were a complete surprise for the four captains . The orders were a surprise for them, they say .
 The ‘special weapons’, as they were called, were loaded on the boats approximately a week before departure in an atmosphere of strict secrecy .
 Each nuclear torpedo had a special ofﬁcer assigned to it, who stayed with it throughout the journey, and even slept next to it . Each of the nuclear torpedo was assigned to a special, specially-trained of-a-kind of of-kind, to stay with
 He was in charge of maintaining the torpedo, and had one set of keys, which were necessary to load it . He was also responsible for maintaining the submarine .
 He was responsible for assembling the torpedo for combat use if such an order had been received from Moscow . He was also the one responsible for making the torpedo .
 Khrushchev was not fully aware that the submarines en route to Cuba were diesel rather than nuclear-powered . It might even have been a mistake .
 Alexander Mozgovoi, ‘Nikita Sergeevich, as well as many non-naval generals and marshals at the helm of the Armed Forces naively believed that they possessed a whole ﬂeet of nuclear missile boats’ Another puzzle regarding the Cuban submarine
 According to commanders, no speciﬁc instructions were given about the use of the nuclear torpedoes .
 Rassokha spoke to the crews of the four submarines . He briefed them on their mission and the use of weapons .
 The only instructions concerning nuclear weapons that the captains remember receiving were given were given in that brieﬁng .
 The only person who talked to us about those weapons was ViceAdmiral Rassokha . Vice Adm. Rassukha was the only person to tell us about the weapons .
 "If you have to come to the surface, and they shoot at you, and you get a hole in your hull," says crew member . "You have to go on the surface and get shot at you," he says. "You get shot in the head, you get shot
 When the packets were opened, the orders read that the boats were to go to Cuba and dock at Mariel . The orders were sent to boats bound for Mariel, Cuba .
 The weapons on the boats were to be in a state of full combat readiness . The weapons are expected to be ready for use in combat .
 Conventional weapons could be used on the orders of the CommanderinChief of the USSR Naval Forces . Nuclear weapons could only be used only on special orders from the Defense Minister . Conventional and nuclear weapons were banned from being used in Soviet Russia .
 Most people would agree that Ketov’s version is more controversial, although none of the surviving veterans has challenged it yet . No one has challenged Ketov's version yet .
 The secrecy of the mission made the conditions of transit even more challenging because the crewmen were unable to ventilate the boat sufirably during short trips to the surface .
 The orders to move at a speed of 9–10 nautical miles and to abide by the secrecy regulations were beyond the capabilities of the diesel submarines . The orders were beyond their capabilities .
 Captains had to use all their skill to make it possible to catch up during the nighttime . There was no observation in order to get to the target position in the scheduled time .
 The only available contemporary Russian document from the submarine trip itself has been found in the writings of the Assistant to Captain Dubivko on B-59, Captain Third Rank Anatoly Andreeev .
 For the last four days, they didn’t even let us come up to the periscope depth . For the past four days we were not allowed to come up with the depth depth .
 The regeneration of air works poorly, the carbon dioxide content in rising, and the electric power reserves are dropping . Carbon dioxide content is rising, the electricity reserves are also dropping .
 The crewmen were supposed to carry out their normal functions, operate the boat and periodically surface for communication sessions with Moscow . In these conditions, the crewmen would not be allowed to surface .
 On board each boat was a special radio intercept team, which was in charge of communications with Moscow . The team conducted interception and decoding of U.S. radio transmissions .
 The head of such a ‘special unit’ on the B-59, Vadim Orlov, recalled that initially his men were greeted with suspicion and even open hostility by the captain and the crew . Orlov: 'They were perceived as outsiders or KGB representatives'
 The boat was packed to the limit with provisions and ammunition for a long trip . The crew had to load substantial quantities of equipment on the boat .
 The worst fear of a submarine captain was to be discovered and brought to the surface by an enemy ship, according to the testimony of all four captains .
 The discovery was a violation of their orders, which could bring severe consequences upon their return to the Soviet Union . Not only was a discovery seen as utter humiliation, but even more importantly, it was an order violation .
 Moscow did not inform captains about the developing situation, only giving them a general outline of the crisis and mostly reports on harvesting in the Soviet Union . The situation was made worse by the fact that the captains were not informed about the situation .
 In interviews and in memoirs, all the Soviet captains recalled their state of extreme tension and confusion . The war above could have begun any time while they were trying to evade their pursuers in the submerged position .
 The captains also anticipated that in the situation where the nuclear exchange either became inevitable or had already begun, Moscow would want them to use their special weapons . The captains were instructed to use the weapons before departure .
 Dubivko: ‘The success of being the ﬁrst to use our weapons depended on the timely reception of the signal to start combat operations. The success of the . success depended on . the timely . reception of a signal to begin combat operations,’ Dub
 Only the B-4 submarine commanded by Ryurik Ketov (tentatively identiﬁed as C-21) with Brigade Commander Captain Captain Agafonov on board was not detected .
 All the Soviet commanders strongly disagree with the term ‘forced to surface’ commonly used in the U.S. to describe how the Soviet submarines were discovered .
 They insist that their submarines had to come to the surface not because they were forced, but because of failing equipment or the need to charge the batteries . The submarines insist they are not forced to surface because of the need for batteries .
 With respect to malfunctioning equipment, the B-130 was the least lucky of the four aircraft . The plane was the last to have malfunctioned equipment malfunction .
 Out of its four diesel engines, three stopped functioning by the time the boat was ordered to take position in the Sargasso Sea .
 The captain radioed Moscow several times to receive permission to come to the surface to try to repair the engines . Captain radioed several times for permission to return to Moscow .
 On 25 October orders came to rise to periscope depth for a continuous communications session . Orders were ordered to increase the depth of the ship .
 No additional information was supplied, and the commander was expecting the worst .
 The actions of the US ASW forces were perceived as threatening by Shumkov’s crew . And the radio space became completely dead’
 He recalls that U.S. ships were acting as if they were preparing to ram his boat, and present it later as an accident . He recalls the incident as an 'accident' that happened in the early 1900s .
 One of the depth charges landed a direct hit on the hull, and its explosion damaged the depth steering wheel . Constant explosions of depth charges created an atmosphere in which Shumkov was wondering whether the situation ﬁtted .
 For a moment, the commander actually thought that his boat was under a United States attack . The commander thought that he was under attack .
 Peter Huchthausen describes an episode when Shumkov telephoned the security of the ‘special’ torpedo, and instructed him to guard the tube without orders from Moscow . The Russian government ordered the security guard to keep the tube safe .
 Huchthausen: Shumkov did not intend to use the torpedo, but wanted to create an impression that he was ready to do so . The security of the security of Russia had to report it later in Moscow, Huchthusen says .
 After the surfacing, the submarine stated its number as ‘945’ and stated that it needed no assistance . The submarine said its number was '945' and that it was not requesting assistance .
 The crew of B-130 tried to repair their diesel engines, but soon discovered that they could be repaired only in port . The crew discovered that the engines could only be repaired in port after coming to the surface .
 A special tugboat, Pamir, was dispatched to transport the B-130 back to Murmansk . Pamir is a Russian tugboat that has been dispatched to Russia .
 Captain Anatoly Dubivko’s submarine, B-36, was the ﬁrst boat to enter the Caicos Straits, when they received the transmission from Moscow to reverse course .
 The position of the B-36 was determined to be in the vicinity of B-130 . The position was found to be near B-129 .
 Dubivko explains tricks he had to use to evade U.S. forces and to surface to charge batteries . He says he also had to be available for communications sessions from Moscow, which were not always reliable . Dubvko: "I had to employ various tricks"
 The United States ships were aware of the fact that the Soviet submarine would have to come to the surface . The U.S. ships sat in water with engines turned off and no lights, in the hope that the submarine would not notice them while surfacing .
 Dubivko was convinced that his boat was attacked by a real torpedo from Charles Cecil . The incident took place during the Second World War in the Great Britain .
 When the submarine submerged to the depths of 25 to 30 meters, the noise, which was moving in the direction of the stern, has disappeared . The noise has disappeared since the submarine was submerged .
 The second source of noise, at the depth of our submergence of 35 to 40 meters, rolled over the deck-cabin and passed above us . The noise was heard by the ship's crew .
 All were sending reports to the central headquarters of the submarine . They all were sending them to the submarine's central headquarters .
 This is where our misconception regarding the location of ‘B-130’ submarine played a trick on us . This is when the submarine was located in the area of the submarine's submarine .
 The main headquarters of the Navy always issued the positions close to ours for that submarine, and in our view, at that point it was supposed to be on the side where it could be discovered . I concluded that the noise which passed toward the stern was precisely from submarine ‘B-
 Dubivko at that moment did not realize that the B-130 had already come to the surface and been discovered by the United States forces . The U.S. forces discovered the B.130 in the Soviet Union in the early hours of the morning .
 The source of the noise must have been a torpedo, he said . Upon learning that, he became convinced that the noise was a torpedo .
 Experts analyze data from data from boat recorders to determine if it was consistent with torpedo . Submarine was hit by a torpedo that barely missed his submarine . He asked experts analyzing data from the recorders whether such a noise was consistent .
 The captain directed his acoustic signal on the same frequency as that employed by the pursuing ships, and to quickly submerge with a change of course . After charging its accumulators, the captain executed a maneuver, which allowed him to confuse the pursuers by directing his acoustic signals . The captain
 The boat was not spotted again by the United States ASW forces and was able to return to Murmansk, despite its failing equipment .
 The most tense encounter between the Soviet and U.S. navies occurred when the group was pursuing and forcing to the surface the Soviet submarine . The Soviet submarine commanded by Captain Second Rank Vitali Savitsky with the 69th brigade chief of staff .
 The effort to surface the B-59 was made hours after the U-2 spy plane was shot down over Cuba . President Kennedy was intensifying his threats to invade Cuba, and as Soviet KGB and diplomatic sources in Cuba were reporting on an imminent and unavoidable invasion .
 The Beale attempts to signal a Soviet submarine B-59 using practice depth charges and sonar .
 Beale, Cony and others force B-59 to surface – its batteries running low . Beale: "B-59's batteries are running low" Beale and Cony were on board at the time of the incident .
 It is surrounded by United States ships and illuminated with bright light . It was surrounded by the U.S. ships .
 October 29 – B-59 submerges without warning and escapes the ASW forces . October 29 is October 29 when the plane is attacked by ASW in the Pacific .
 The same events looked very different from a submerged submarine unable to charge its batteries and unable to get a communication session with Moscow for over two days to check if the hostilities had already begun .
 The record of developments on the B59 is based on the recollections of Vadim Orlov, head of the special radio intercept team on the submarine .
 The conditions on the boat had been steadily deteriorating to the point where ‘people were dropping like dominoes’ and the temperature in the coldest section reached 45 degrees Celsius .
 The crew was aware of the developments in the Cuban missile crisis from the radio intercept, but in the two days before 27 October was unable to come to periscope depth to use the antenna . The situation was especially tense because the crew was unaware of developments .
 The last news they had from the world above them led them to anticipate that hostilities between the U.S. and the Soviet Union could begin at any moment, or had even already begun .
 In this atmosphere the explosions of the PDCs were interpreted as a possible attack on the submarine . Captain Savitski's emotional outburst prompted an emotional outburst from the captain . The explosions prompted an angry outburst from Captain Savitki .
 The Americans hit us with something stronger than the grenades – apparently with a practice depth bomb . It was apparently with practice depth bombs, the U.S. said .
 After this attack, Savitsky, who in addition to everything was not able to establish connection with the General Staff, got furious . Savitski was totally exhausted and got furious. He said: "I'm not going to get back in touch with General Staff"
 He summoned the ofﬁcer who was assigned to the nuclear torpedo, and ordered him to assemble it to battle readiness . The torpedo was ordered to be ready for battle .
 Savitsky was able to rein in his wrath after the incident . But we did not ﬁre the nuclear torpedo – we did . Savitski's wrath did not stop .
 Second Captain Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov made the decision to come to the surface . After consulting with Second Captain . Vasili  Arkhiprovich Arhipov and his deputy political ofﬁcer Ivan Semenovich Maslennikov, he made the
 The story of a near-use of a nuclear torpedo by a Soviet submarine commander remains very controversial in Russia . This story of the near-missed use of the nuclear torpedo is still very controversial .
 Savitsky and Arkhipov are deceased and cannot conﬁrm or deny it . Unfortunately, both Savitski and Arkinov are dead and cannot deny it.
 Vasilii Arkhipov’s widow recently went on record, saying that her husband mentioned the story of how they almost ﬁred a nuclear torpedo at an American destroyer during the Cuban missile crisis .
 No action was taken during those emotional minutes, other than the commander’s outburst described above . Importantly, however, it appears that no actions were taken during the emotional minutes .
 The captain guarding the torpedo did not receive the orders to . prepare it for possible use . The captain didn't receive the . orders to prepare the weapon for use .
 The last submarine of the 69th brigade, the B-4 under the command of Ryurik Ketov, was the luckiest of the four .
 It was the only one of the submarines not discovered and brought to the surface by U.S. ASW forces . It was detected and had Julie and Jezebel sonobuoys dropped on it .
 When the Soviet submarines returned to Murmansk, the commanders were subjected to a series of interrogations by the Soviet Navy command, and later by the Collegium of the USSR Ministry of Defense in Moscow .
 The perception of the authorities was that the captains failed in their mission and violated their orders . The perception that the authorities were that the captain failed in his mission was that he violated his orders was the perception .
 The initial expectation was that the captains of the ‘Cuban’ submarines would be punished for their inability to keep their mission secret and for allowing the U.S. Navy to force them to the surface .
 Documents reﬂecting the analysis of the submarines’ mission by the Soviet military authorities remain classiﬁed . The only insight available is from the testimony of the participants, which provides ample grounds to conclude that the top Soviet military leadership was under the impression that
 At least some of the Soviet military command thought that it would have been better if the submarines used their weapons rather than allow the U.S. forces to force them to surface .
 The ﬁrst debrieﬁng of the captains took place on the day after they returned to port . The debrie was held on the same day as the captain of the ship .
 Dubivko: Commission on analyzing actions of submarines in extraordinary conditions was aimed at uncovering violations of orders, documents, or instructions by the commander or by the personnel' The commanders were especially criticized for violating the conditions of secrecy .
 All the captains described the subsequent session of the Defense Ministry Collegium in Moscow as especially acrimonious . The captains said the session was particularly acrimous .
 Each of them and Chief of Staff Vasili Arkhipov were asked to present oral reports to the Defense Minister .
 Marshal Grechko received their reports at the Collegium of the Defense Ministry . Marshal Malinovsky was ill, and Marshal Grekko was ill . Marshal Greckko received the reports .
 Marshal Bagramyan suggested that he should give special attention to the issues of communications, says President Obama . "Marshal Bagraman approached me and suggested that I should focus on communications," he says .
 Marshal Grechko refused to listen to my report on the problems and difﬁculties of the trip . Marshal Grekko refused .
 He was unable to understand why a submarine would have to charge its battery every night, and why it would be in RDP or stationary mode to do that .
 The only thing he understood was that we violated the secrecy requirements, were discovered by Americans, and that for some time we stayed in close contact with them .
 Alexander Mozgovoi presents a detailed account of that Collegium meeting in his book, based on his interviews with the participants . Alexander's book, "The Collegium," is published by the author of the book .
 Marshal Grechko hit his glasses against the table in fury, breaking them into pieces . He also cites an episode when he removed his glasses and hit them against a table in anger . He then left the room after that .
 EXCOMM was aware that the Soviet Union might have sent its submarines to Cuba as part of the deployment . ExCOMM tried to locate the Soviet submarines and bring them to the surface .
 At ﬁrst, the US decision-makers were not sure if those were nuclear-powered submarines, nor if they carried missiles . The U.S. decided not to say if the submarines carried missiles or nuclear weapons .
 Once the submarines were identiﬁed as Foxtrots, it was assumed that they carried no nuclear weapons, since nuclear-tipped torpedoes were not part of normal ammunition for that type of submarine . However, once they were identified, they were assumed to carry no
 President Kennedy was briefed on the intelligence that the Soviet submarines were on their way to the Caribbean on 23 October . Kennedy was informed of the intelligence in October .
 Attorney General Robert Kennedy was especially concerned about the boats and the possibility that one of them would have to be stopped if it tried to cross the quarantine line . Attorney General Kennedy was particularly concerned about one of the boats .
 He ordered a maximum ASW effort to track and surface the submarines, but at the same time emphasized that maximum caution must be exercised . The U.S. Navy says it will use ASW to try and find the submarines .
 Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara was anxious about signaling Soviet submarines to come to the surface . For his part, Defense Secretary was anxious to signal Soviet submarines .
 He wanted to make sure the submarines understood the signals as they were intended to be, and not as a provocation or even worse, an attack . He said he wanted to ensure the signals were not intended to attack .
 On 24 October he instructed the navy commanders to develop a special system of signaling, which he immediately approved . The system was approved by President Vladimir Putin .
 Upon receiving this signal, the submarine should come to the surface on an easterly course . The submarine should be sent to a low-level position .
 The notice contained an assurance that all signaling devices were harmless . All signaling devices are harmless, authorities said .
 The EXCOMM transcripts reveal how much attention was given to the proper signaling of the submarines . The policymakers realized the dangers of a possible attack on a submarine if it refused to surface or interfered with the quarantine .
 The transcript shows that Kennedy personally was very concerned about what the chain of events could lead to . Kennedy personally expressed his concern about what could happen next . The transcript was released by CNN .
 The United States did not receive an acknowledgment of the receipt of the identification procedures . Alexis Johnson noted that although the identiﬁcation procedures were sent to Moscow, the U.S. was not acknowledged by Moscow .
 MacNamara described how the submarines would be signaled by the practice depth charges, according to Robert Kennedy, ‘were the time of greatest worry for the President.’
 His hand went up to his face and covered his mouth and he closed his ﬁst. His hand was up his nose and his mouth was covered in his mouth .
 The plan is to send antisubmarine helicopters out to harass the submarine, Dean Obeidallah says . What is the plan is, Dean says, to send out the helicopters, he says .
 The plan is to put pressure on the submarine, move it out of the area by that pressure, and then make the intercept . And the plan, therefore, is to move the submarine out of that area and destroy it .
 It would be appropriate to ask if the Soviet captains actually received the signaling instructions from the Soviet captain . It would also be appropriate if the Soviets received the instructions .
 In their books, both Joseph Bouchard and Peter Huchthausen assume that commanders must have known about the signaling procedures .
 Submerged Soviet submarines essentially ignored sonar and explosive charge signals . Submarged Soviet subs ignored the sonar signals .
 There were no reported instances of a Soviet submarine immediately surfacing upon hearing the signals . The signals were not immediately detected .
 Soviet submarines surfaced because they needed to replenish air and batteries, or because they had some kind of mechanical problem . Submarine surfaced because of replenishment of air, batteries or because of mechanical problems .
 The explosions of PDCs were perceived not as a signal but as a hostile action . Moreover, in each case, the explosions were perceived as an attack on the enemy .
 Each of the commanders and Vadim Orlov remarked in their recollections about how the hull ampliﬁed the sound and how the boat shook with each explosion .
 Dubivko even claimed that he was attacked by an actual torpedo . Each captain attributed at least some damage to his submarine from those explosions . Dubivkos even claimed to have been attacked by a torpedo .
 Had they known that the PDCs were simply signaling devices, it is unlikely that the captains would have associated them with the possibility that the war had already started above the water .
 Another concern was that a U.S. ship might try to ram them and present it as an accident . As was discussed above, another concern of the Soviet submarine commanders was .
 We have grounds to believe that the U.S. would most likely have made a nuclear counter-response . The United States most likely would have responded with a nuclear response, the author says .
 Recent evidence indicates that U.S. ships had nuclear depth charges on board, while non-nuclear components for more depth charges were stored at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba .
 Even such limited initial nuclear exchange could have potentially led to escalation of con�ictict . The US command was unaware of the presence of nuclear torpedoes on Soviet submarines .
 Analyzing all the available evidence from the Russian and U.S. archives, as well as eyewitness accounts, one has to state from the outset that at this time, all the conclusions that can be drawn will be of a preliminary character .
 Most of the evidence, which would allow one to speak more conﬁdently about the submarine story, remains in the Russian archives . Even with the recent revelations about the journey of the Soviet submarines equipped with nuclear torpedoes, most of the information remains in Russian archives.
 What we now know is only the tip of the iceberg that is slowly beginning to emerge, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 The submarines were sent to Cuba as part of an overall deployment of forces of Operation ‘Anadyr’ with the mission to establish a Soviet naval base at Mariel, Cuba .
 The submarines were equipped with nuclear torpedoes as part of a general plan of creating a nuclear base on Cuba . They were not issued battle orders because their mission was to serve as the spearhead of the future naval base, and therefore they had to arrive at Mariel .
 Another submarine, B-75, which also carried nuclear torpedoes, was assigned a different task – to escort and protect the Soviet transport ship Alexandrovsk, also carrying ‘special’ equipment .
 This submarine had more speciﬁc battle orders on the use of its weapons, if the transport were boarded or attacked . The submarine was ordered to use its weapons if it was attacked or boarded .
 The orders on using nuclear-tipped torpedoes were the same – they could only be used by order from Moscow . However, for all the Foxtrots of the 69th brigade, and the B-75 Zulu, the orders of use of nuclear-armed submarines were the
 Although physically the captains could arm and launch the nuclear-tipped torpedo, the procedure of the actual launching was quite complex . The procedure required three keys to be initiated .
 According to all available evidence, no nuclear torpedo was actually assembled to battle readiness . The tense situation on B-59 resulted in a probable effort to arm the torpedo . No nuclear torpedo actually was assembled .
 The presence of the nuclear torpedoes remained secret greatly raised the probability of an incident . U.S. Navy carried out its efforts to force the exhausted Soviet commanders to bring their malfunctioning ships to the surface .
 To the captains of the ‘harassed’ submarines, who were unaware of the signaling procedures, the situation above might have looked as if the war had already started, which might have moved them to ‘use or lose’ their most prized weapons .
 If a launch occurred, whether intentionally or accidentally, and the United States ships were hit with an unexpected nuclear torpedo, the probability that the U.S. Navy would perceive the launch as intentional would have been very high . This might have prompted the US side to use the nuclear depth charges
 The conference was the latest in a series of critical oral history meetings on the Cuban missile crisis . The conference generated worldwide headlines by gathering US, Russian and Cuban veterans of the 1962 missile crisis in Havana .
 Volkogonov Collection, Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, Reel 17, Container 26 . Collection includes a copy of the original .
 Khrushchev personally oversaw the passage of naval ships per the ‘‘Anadyr’ ’’ operation . The operation was part of the plan to pass the Soviet Union's naval ships .
 The passage of the detachment of naval ships to Cuba will be done in full combat readiness . The passage will be carried out in combat readiness, says Navy spokesman .
 The time for the passage will be up to 32 days, of which 2–3 will be for conducting an exercise . The time will be between 32 days and 32 days .
 In the ﬁrst stage of the crossing the formations of submarines and surface ships are to proceed separately, in groups .
 The squadron of submarines with tenders and the transport with the special cargo will leave from Kola Gulf on 7 October . They will proceed to the exercise area through the passage between Iceland and the Faeroe Islands .
 For concealment the submarines will submerged by day but surfaced at night with an average daily speed of 7–8 miles an hour . The submarines will also be submerged by night but surfaced by day with a speed of up to 8 miles per hour .
