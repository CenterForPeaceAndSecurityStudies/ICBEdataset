 The successful and determinedly civilian orchestration of the great panoply of persuasion that was brought to bear on the Soviets in the Caribbean seemed to herald an era where vastly expanded power, blessedly, had become a useful, useful, and rational instrument of American policy .
 The triumphant position of the U.S. in the aftermath of the Cuban Crisis reinforced the longstanding American hope that a stable international order could be sustained if it were underwritten by America's readiness to employ effective force .
 In the early 1960s, a new nexus between force and order seemed, to the crisis managers, clearly to exist . But in the early 60s, the new nexus seemed to be clearly to existence . In the 1960s it seemed to exist, but then again, it was not
 The union promised no less than the achievement of a stable, liberal international regime . It was predicated on ample reserves of American power directed by a confident, sophisticated national security elite .
 There was no need for deterrence to come to any kind of unlimited test since limited coercion could form an unmistakable and undeniable politico-military grammar . Only limited coercion can form an undeniable political and military grammar .
 If force could be made a discrete instrument of bargaining, the inner dynamic of Soviet expansionism could be tamed and defeated without incommensurate dangers . If force was made a bargaining instrument, it could be used to tame and defeat the USSR .
 The Cuban missile crisis seemed to offer the promise of the sterile and fruitless Kabuki of diplomacy, replete with archaic conference halls and interminable discussion, could be replaced by the management centre, the telex, and rapid-fire .

 Wars began with declarations and ultimatums, and they ended with treaties and conferences . Wars started with declarations, ultimatum and treaties, but ended with conferences and treaties .
 Short of war, there was an abundance of military manoeuvres and demonstrations of intent that were undertaken without much public concern . The British government was not in touch with the public during the Cold War .

 From the Treaty of Westphalia to the onset of the Napoleonic War, capitals and courts were rarely at risk . From the beginning of the War to the start of the 18th century, the courts were never at risk of a major loss .
 "The consequence of defeat, in contradistinction to earlier practices, was neither slavery, slaughter, nor forcible conversion," he said .
 Gains or losses were summed up in the form of military alliances, dynastic marriages, or overseas colonies . Gaining or losses are summed up and parsed out in the way of the wars .
 By the middle of the eighteenth century, there had emerged a kind of 'international society' of resonant interests . By the end of the 18th century, it had emerged that this kind of society had emerged .
 In this 'classic' international 'system, the familiar palliatives of diplomatic adjustment were well tolerated . The 'classic system' was well tolerated by the British government in the 1980s .
 In the end, diplomats settled up at the bargaining table what soldiers had determined on the battlefield . Diplomats settled up what they had determined in the battle .
 To Clausewitz, the warrior and diplomat had a kind of regulatory synergy . Voltaire sniffed that it was not worth worrying about a few 'miserable acres of snow' when he ceded Canada after the Seven Years War .
 One will only fight until some modest quid pro quo had been acquired, and a moderate effort should suffice for that . A moderate effort will suffice, and that's what's needed to be achieved, he says .
 The enemy's reasoning will be much the same . " e must be willing to wage such minimal wars which consist in merely threatening the enemy with negotiations held in reserve"
 Clausewitz's great fear was that war would become 'pointless and devoid of sense' - a 'thing unto itself' Clausewitz feared war would be a 'things unto itself', and war was a 'something unto itself .
 Once war compelled animosities to become too intense, it lost its integration with the broader world of statecraft . The U.S. has lost its place in the world of diplomacy and diplomacy in the past .
 If war were left to the generals or left to its own inner expansive logic, then war's political nature would be suffused . War's politics would also be suffored by the power of the generals, says David Cameron .
 By the end of the nineteenth century, war could consume not just professional armies, but great sections of whole societies as well . War could consume whole societies, as well as professional armies . War was the beginning of the modern age of war .
 "Once war began to approach its terrible and absolute form, the only remaining rationale for its employment was to defeat the cause of war itself," says President Obama .
 Peace would be durable only if dictated unconditionally after crushing the enemy, says President Obama . Peace would only be if it was decided after crushing an enemy, Obama says .

 Once the Soviets achieved a kind of nominal strategic nuclear parity; war, defined in terms of nuclear weapons, was a coin too fearful in consequence to be redeemed . War, defined as war, was defined as a coin that was too fearful to be redeemable .
 There was a fear that nuclear weapons would embolden the Soviets . Yet, while nuclear weapons might paralyse one side, they might embolden one side .

 To the 'new strategists',34 the great given was that while classic diplomacy had no real utility, functional diplomacy had developed . A kind of functional diplomacy35 had developed wherein adversaries would bargain with each other through the mechanism of graduated increments of military force .
 This odd 'vicious' 'diplomacy of violence' gave a perverse and pernicious twist to the ancient practices of official 'gentlemen' who directed their energies toward the search for settlements .
 'The power to hurt is bargaining power' whose 'only purpose, unless sport or revenue, must be to influence somebody's behavior to coerce his behavior' 'To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated,' says former State Department official Thomas Schelling .
 As soon as the Soviets acquired deliverable strategic weapons, in the mid-1950s, Eisenhower began to indicate that he was willing, for his part, to move toward a settlement . To exploit it, is diplomacy â€” vicious diplomacy .
 As he told the Soviets at Geneva in 1955, ' it was that wars began where diplomacy fails, diplomacy must begin because war has failed'39 But diplomacy was not the Eisenhower Administration's long suit .

 The Kennedy team, perhaps with the exception of the President himself, also had a low regard for the diplomatic enterprise . Secretary of State Dean Rusk was the nominal embodiment of the State Department .

 Kennedy and McNamara grappled with the problem of central deterrence at a time when it was clear that the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal . Yet much of American defence planning focused on somehow actually using nuclear weapons .
 Kennedy, urged on by Eisenhower, focused on the Laotian problem in 1961 . New President was startled to discover that the Joint Chiefs seemed obsessed with nuclear weapons .
 At least 60,000 (and perhaps 160,000) United States troops, armed with tactical nuclear weapons, were to be brought in through two airports . Robert Kennedy recalled the meetings on Laos, in 1961, when the military unanimously recommended sending in at least 60-000 .
 The representative said we would then have to destroy Hanoi and possibly use nuclear weapons . The representative told us that the government would have to use a nuclear weapon to destroy Vietnam .
 The President sought to make it appear as if an armed solution might be necessary, while simultaneously striving to engineer, through diplomacy, a well-veiled exit from an unsupportable position, and to mask that retreat as a kind of personal victory .
 All sides covertly and liberally violated the agreement, but the Laotian issue nearly disappeared from the headlines . All sides secretly violated the deal .
 Kennedy had finessed the matter entirely by dint of exploring the distance of Laos from the concerns of most Americans with the help of court scribes . Kennedy had firmed up the issue entirely by . dinting of exploring . distance from Laos from most Americans .
 If retreats were to happen elsewhere, the next time they would have to be even more befogged than had been Harriman's discussions in Geneva on the Laotian question .

 Even though Cuba and other geographic 'threats' consumed inordinate amounts of time, they were 'side issues', peripheral to the real centre of American concerns . Cuba's European context .
 The only defence of Europe must be the thinning reed of nuclear deterrence . Without German manpower, the only defence must be a thinning defence of the continent .

 The Soviets could only be stopped from making a determined thrust continuing to the English Channel by a barrier of German manpower . Nuclear weapons might deter a Soviet invasion, but the Germans could only stop it .
 The emotional pivot of the German question rested in the exposed occupied enclave of Berlin . Berlin was the emotional pivot for the German Question .
 After Dulles died, Eisenhower determined to seek a peaceful solution to the Berlin crisis . Eisenhower was spurred by Khrushchev's periodic deadlines and threats, but was spurred, to be sure .
 The Vienna meeting went badly, as a startled young President encountered a bullying Khrushchev . The meeting was the first time the two leaders had met in Vienna .
 Khrushchev reaffirmed his deadline for an accommodation over Berlin as December . The deadline for a deal was set for December .
 East German troops began to tear up the streets at the western edge of the divide that separated the Soviet zone of Berlin from the occupying Western allies .
 By 26 October 1961, American tanks faced Soviet tanks on the Friedrichstrasse, nearly muzzle to muzzle . The battle was nearly muzzle-to-mouthed .
 Kennedy himself estimated the chances of nuclear war at 20 per cent . A senior Soviet official in Berlin at the time said that if the American tanks had 'followed the orders given to them and those orders were to destroy the Berlin wall â€” our tanks would then open fire'
 Three and a half billion dollars were allocated to civilian defence . Household radiation detectors and national air raid siren system were among the items allocated .
 The first step in ending the crisis came with an apparent Soviet tactical retreat . The Soviet Union's apparent tactical retreat was seen as a tactical retreat.
 Khrushchev said: 'So let's give them one' 'Let's give the Russians a chance' 'I'm going to give them a chance,' he said .
 Khrushchev then announced that he would not seek a peace treaty with his East German subordinates because the Western powers had showed 'understanding' East Germany seemed to have been securely imprisoned, he said .
 A month before the missiles were discovered in Cuba, a special KGB liaison from the Soviet Embassy, told Bobby Kennedy that there would be no Soviet defensive missiles in Cuba .
 President Kennedy disturbed by the audacity of the move much more than he was bothered by the arithmetic of mutual atomic damage . President Kennedy was disturbed by audacity .
 "The sum of the Soviet action constituted both a national and personal test," says Soviet leader Vladimir Putin . "It was a national test. It was a test for the nation," says Putin .
 A shift from the 'missile gap in reverse' of the year before to a position where, as Kennedy fretted, 'they look like they're coequal with us', was bound to be unsettling . deterrence rests as much on a psychological relationship as it does on the balance of
 If the Soviets had succeeded in keeping their missiles in Cuba, 'it would have politically changed the balance of power' Kennedy summed up the experience in public .
 McNamara had, well before the crisis, abandoned 'static' measures of nuclear advantage . 'Static' measures had to be reckoned in terms of raw megatonnage delivered to an ever more expansive list of targets . It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality', McN
 'bean counting' was somewhat surreal and its impact was largely 'psychological', as one of the participants in the Excomm deliberations put it . Undoubtedly this 'bean count' was surreal and the impact of it was largely psychological .
 U.S. analysts at the time said the 24 MRBMs and some 12 to 16 IRBMs discovered in Cuba had raised the number of targets the Soviets could lethally cover in the United States by 40 per cent .
 On the merits of what was known, the missiles severely eroded the possibility of an unanswered U.S. first strike against the Soviets . The missiles were likely to be used in a first strike, the author says. The missiles could have prevented an unanswered first strike .
 The Secretary of Defense believed, before the crisis, that a disarming first strike was a chimera . This had been something central to U.S. Air Force planners, but was not critical in the mind of the secretary of defense, he says .
 The missiles gave the Soviets some of the leverage they had lost when the missile gap had been revealed as a myth the year before . Clearly, however, in their own terms, the missiles seemed to give the Soviets a greater leverage . The missiles were seen as giving the Soviets more of the
 In October 1962, Kennedy said to his advisors, 'I should have said . . that we don't care. That's what I should have done,' he said . Kennedy said in 1962 .

 "I just think it's just a question of . . . a political struggle as much as military' issue," he says .
 If there was a Soviet response, then the Soviet Union would be struck as well, presumably with a disarming atomic first strike . The U.S. would then be struck by a nuclear first strike, the author says . If there were no response, there would be a first strike
 Most of the Excomm felt that if Cuba were invaded, the Soviets would be forced to move in an area where the Russians had an equivalent preponderance, and where the U.S. had a equivalent exposure . Most seemed to feel that if the Soviets were invaded they would be
 Robert Kennedy's memoirs have it that the invasion was expected 'by Monday or Tuesday', 29 or 30 October . An invasion was 'expected' to take place by 'Monday or Tuesday'
 It is possible that an invasion could have been mounted, and that the Soviets suffered high casualties, and a significant strategic and political loss, might not really have done much . Some analysts and some of the participants in the crisis now maintain .
 Some in the Excomm were willing to 'write off an attack on Turkey' if a Soviet attack were confined to the Jupiter sites . Some in Excomm believed the attack would be limited to only Jupiter sites, rather than Turkey .

 By 27 October, the Excomm had become convinced that whatever the missiles' ultimate strategic meaning, their symbolic meaning was both unmistakable and no longer tolerable . The Excomm became convinced that . whatever the missile's ultimate strategic . meaning, it was not enough .
 The longer missiles stay on in Cuba, the more irretrievable the situation would become, the longer they stay . The longer the missiles stay in Cuba would become more likely to break up the situation, the president says .
 The longer operational missiles were in place, the more certain it was that they changed the Soviet bargaining position vis-a-vis the U.S. The longer they were there, the longer they would change the Soviet negotiating position . The missiles diminished the standing of the United States in the

 Shooting could start anywhere, and then the U.S. would have put in jeopardy not just its control of events, but control of the rhythm of combat as well . The United States would have been in jeopardy if it started shooting .
 Chiefs and Chairman Maxwell Taylor were clear in their recommendation in favour of a strike no later than Monday . The military would start to lose its edge, as planes and men wore down under the strain of peak readiness . With each surveillance, moreover, more planes and pilots were exposed to hazards .
 The consensus that the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours was further crystallized by the receipt of two quite different messages from the government . The consensus is that the government must find a way to resolve the crisis in 48 hours .
 The first was a rambling private letter, offering to exchange missiles for a promise that the U.S. would not invade Cuba . The first offered to exchange the missiles in exchange for an offer that the United States would not invasion Cuba .
 It mentioned the obsolete, but nonetheless recently operational, US missiles in Turkey, near the Soviet border . The missiles are in Turkey near the border .
 An Air Force U-2 surveillance flight was shot down over Cuba with the loss of a pilot . Soon after the second message was in hand, an Air Force .
 Reconnaissance planes would scour the island in runs spaced at two-hour intervals . The planes would search the island at two hours a day .
 The President was hardly compelled by the logic of targeting a few of the offending Soviet-manned anti-aircraft batteries .
 The momentum of events, it was clear in the Excomm discussions, pointed to striking Soviet surface-to-air missiles, said Russian President Vladimir Putin . The momentum was clear, said Putin's spokesman .
 Joint Chiefs wanted an all-out co-ordinated air strike launched on Cuba 'right away' But agreed to a limited, single strike first, with the understanding that if another attack on US aircraft occurred, then there would be a thoroughgoing extirpation of the offending SAM
 Secretary Rusk, on contemplating the reaction of the 'Hawks' to the news of the downed U-2, found his eyes brimming with tears .
 This made a 'token' Soviet counterforce, a 'damage limiting' strike against military targets, seem far-fetched .
 Whether or not the Soviets understood or knew U.S. targeting plans, there was pressure on Khrushchev to act . The Soviets were pressured to act by the United States .
 Khrushchev was more 'Normal' than he thought nuclear weapons could not just be an instrument of bluff . He would have assumed that American thinking would be tracking an equivalent line of thought . McNamara and Bundy would claim that there had been little likelihood that the SIOP would ever become
 Clearly, most of the participants in those events found them harrowing . The events were harrowing, but some of the people involved in them found it harrowing .
 American intelligence learned that their premier informant, Colonel Olaeg Penkovsky, had been arrested on 22 October . American intelligence had learned that the premier informant in the country had been captured .
 The Soviets might have inferred that the information relayed by Penkovsky to the United States verified that the U.S. had sufficient nuclear punch to exercise the Chiefs' preferred first SIOP option, a devastating first strike .
 Orders to cease the U-2 flights near the Soviet borders were either not received or ignored . U.2 flights were either ignored or not received .
 In one 'Strangelove' incident, an authorized U-2 entered Soviet airspace . The U.2 entered the Soviet airspace in one of the world's most famous U.S. aircraft .
 The U-2's SOS alerted Galena Air Force base in Alaska and a group of American fighter aircraft rose to escort the errant plane back to base .
 Most of the actions relevant to this alert would have been picked up in due course . But the Soviets must have been puzzled by the bravura with which these moves were broadcast .
 "Unprecedented intensification of peacetime readiness for war was effected openly so that the Soviets could pick the message up and be suitably daunted," says the British Prime Minister .
 Some analysts took this as preparation for war, notwithstanding the fact that none of the Soviet strategic forces within the Soviet Union had been put on alert . An Atlas ICBM was test-launched from Vandenberg on 26 October 1962 .
 The missile that was tested sat side by side with others that were fully loaded, already on alert . The missile was tested alongside others that sat side-by-side with others on alert, already .
 At the least, the test flight might well have appeared as a nuclear 'stray' had the Soviets been able to observe it . The test flight may well have been a 'missile' test flight .
 At the most, it could have been seen, like the wandering U-2, as a precursor to an all-out attack . At the least, it was seen as an indication of an imminent attack .
 At the height of the crisis, at least one CIA covert action team was roaming Cuba . At the time of the Cuban crisis, the CIA was in control of Cuba .
 Operation Mongoose activities were suspended, apparently only as an afterthought, on 30 October 1962, by Robert Kennedy . Robert Kennedy was president of the State of the Union in 1962 .
 CIA-sponsored unit decided, on its own authority, to blow up a factory on 8 November . The factory was blown up by a factory owned by the CIA, a source says .
 Cuban units were reported to be vulnerable to rifle fire, vulnerable as they were . If they had attempted to kill Castro or his associates, or if they had killed any of the high Soviet officials on the island at the time .
 The main instrument of control of the tempo of pressure was the blockade run by the Navy . The blockade was the main instrument, the Navy.
 If you and your deputy will go to your offices, the Navy will run the blockade . The Navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones . The blockade has been in place since then .
 All six submarines near the quarantined area were shadowed by the British Navy .
 One sub was 'surfaced', unknown to the Excomm, by a lowlevel depth charge and disabled . The sub was disabled by a 'low-level' depth charge .
 The Soviets were not informed of where the quarantined area was supposed to have been in any case, until 27 October 1962 'Black Saturday' when George Ball suggested to the President that they be notified .
 In the wake of the crisis' successful resolution, innate self-confidence suffused the profound relief of the moment . The Jupiters in the aftermath of the successful resolution .
 The national security group, ExComm, who had handled the Cuba material, code-named, meaningfully, 'Elite', felt that they had mastered the merger of politics and force . ExComm felt they had masterminded the merger .
 National security managers occupy a narrow circle with few apprentices and still fewer fully accredited practitioners . The country's national security managers are in a tight circle, with only a few apprenticeships .
 Both in scope and depth, the President and his advisors had a decisive edge over the President alone . But the Excomm conversations hardly show a cool delineation of alternatives or a deliberate dissection of well-gamed actions .
 There were reports that one assistant secretary was so disconcerted and fatigued that he drove into a tree at 4 am. There were also reports that he was so fatigued he had to drive to a tree .
 NATO trade deal could be embarrassment within NATO and opening to right-wing critics . Trade deal could look reasonable at home and overseas, but could also be embarrassing .
 To his largest group of advisors he wanted to appear as resolute as possible . He wanted to be resolute about his decision .
 Only at the eleventh hour, and then only to a small circle of intimates, was Kennedy willing to show some of the flexibility he had apparently come up with on his own .
 Not known to this 'mini' Excomm, however, was the approach that Bobby had made to Ambassador Dobrynin regarding a swap of the Jupiters for the missiles in Cuba .
 Rusk and President Kennedy took further measures to end the crisis via a quid pro quo . Then, very late that night, President Kennedy and Rusk agreed to give Rusk a deal to end crisis .
 The Secretary was empowered to authorize, on a signal, the UN Secretary-General to announce in public the offer of an exchange of the United States missiles in Turkey for the missiles in Cuba . It was a complex game.
 Khrushchev had asked his brother to see if Ambassador Dobrynin would accept a 'private understanding' with the President to exchange the Jupiters for missiles, and to offer publicly to guarantee that the Cubans would be free from American invasion .
 Formally there was to be a 'no invasion' pledge in return for removal of missiles . Formally, the pledge was made to remove the missiles in exchange for removing them .
 If Khrushchev rejected Bobby's offer, the President was prepared to go forward with the offer of a public trade .
 Khrushchev responded via Moscow radio, accepting Robert Kennedy's offer without mentioning the imminent withdrawal of the Jupiters . Kennedy was thus saved from the ignominy of having to make his eagerness to initiate a public swap known to most of his advisors for 25 years .
 The crisis was portrayed as a 'test of will' that highlighted the Soviet transgression of the political-nuclear status quo . Crisis was portrayed by the Soviet Union as a test of will .
 Chroniclers of the 1960s claimed that the Soviets merely capitulated . The chroniclers of that era claimed that it was a capitulation . Now historians say the Soviets simply capitulated to the West .
 New national security managers proliferated after Cuba routed those who had most favoured negotiations . One result of the misleading way in which the crisis legend was retold was that the new national security .
 In front of each other, the Excomm members were afraid of being sullied by the taint of 'Munich' The Excomm was afraid of sounding anything less than bold . The ExComm members fear of being 'sullied'
 Only the 'cautious and 'hawkish' Rusk could think it 'easier on us' to propose the swap . Kennedy seems to have told his brother to take to the Soviets informally days before .
 This one gets talked about less than the others because of the power of the Munich stigma and because it sounds a lot less courageous . This one is less courageous than the other, because it's less courageous, and it's not more courageous .
 A 'moderate' in these terms was limited to suggesting limited violence . A moderate would be considered a moderate by the U.S. State Department .
 The military's enthusiasm for preemptive attacks on the Soviet Union, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay's wish to attack Cuba, drew great scorn from the Kennedy national security consiglieri .
