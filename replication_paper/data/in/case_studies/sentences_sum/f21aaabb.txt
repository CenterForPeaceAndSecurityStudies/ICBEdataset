 Study shows how Canadian diplomats responded to the crisis and sought to support their vital ally in the events of October and November 1962 .
 Their lengthy discussion touched on a range of topics, from the status of Berlin to disarmament negotiations, and to the Soviet leader’s domestic popularity .
 Khrushchev urges Ottawa to revert to its former position on Cuba . Now that tensions had abated, Khrushchevitch urged Ottawa to reverse its position on the island .
 It contradicts the commonly held view that Canada–US relations ‘reached their nadir’ in October 1962 . The discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba precipitated a standoﬀ between the United States and Soviet Union during which Canada appeared to only support the U.
 Hours after the President of the United States, John F Kennedy, took to the airwaves on 22 October to disclose the presence of the weapons and to announce his response, Canada’s Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, rose in the House of Commons .
 In a poorly worded speech, Diefenbaker seemed to question Kennedy’s actions as well as his claim that missiles were being deployed in Cuba . The President made the comments during a speech .
 I would like to acknowledge the support of the Kennedy Library Foundation and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council . I would also like to thank the Kennedy Foundation for their support .
 My thanks, as well, to Galen Perras; his thoughtful comments and criticisms on a draft of this paper were of great help .
 Diefenbaker was unwilling to permit Canadian forces to go on alert until 24 October two days after the United States military had requested that this be done . The Canadian Defence Minister, Douglas Harkness, had readied Canada’s air force as well as its navy on
 Royal Canadian Air Force pilots readied themselves to defend North American airspace . Canadian ships patrolled for Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic in the 1980s .
 Canada was the only U.S. ally to take on an active military role during the October crisis . The Prime Minister’s prevarications and the resulting confrontation between Canada and the United States are the main focus of the studies of Canadian reactions .
 The most prevalent view is that Canadian or rather Diefenbaker’s inaction was inexcusable and greatly angered the U.S. The Canadian government has been criticized for its actions in the past .
 NORAD, or the North American Air Defence Command, was the joint command providing for the defence of North American airspace by both Canada and the United States . NORAD required mutual consultation in the event of a crisis in the U.S.
 By October 1962, thanks to policy and personality diﬀerences, Kennedy and Diefenbaker loathed one another . The crisis consultation did not take place between them during the crisis .
 The lack of consultation was the natural result of the disparate power relationship between Canada and the U.S. A recent study has also contended, a recent study also contended .
 Some decry U.S. treatment of Canada throughout the crisis . Some support Diefenbaker’s hesitant actions . Canada did not receive special consideration .
 Consultation and issues arising from it have been the primary focus for historians . Consultation is a rocky state of aﬀairs between Ottawa and Washington .
 Canada stood by the U.S. throughout the crisis, says David Frum . "The answer is that throughout the . crisis Canada stood . by the United States," he says . Frum says .
 Canadian oﬃcials from the Department of External Aﬀairs played a helpful role by providing intelligence to the Americans . They also acted as an intermediary between Cuba and the United States .
 Washington’s actions were a justiﬁed response to dangerous provocations from Moscow and Havana, experts say . Washington's actions were taken in response to provocations, they say .
 This study seeks to complement those works focused on Canada’s military role, through an exploration of how Canadian diplomats viewed and responded to the crisis . This study is a study of Canadian diplomats' responses to the Syrian crisis .
 An examination of the gamut of Canada’s role in the events of October and November 1962 leads to far diﬀerent conclusions .
 Since the success of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Canada has maintained diplomatic ties with Cuba’s government . Canada has pursued a policy of trading with Cuba in all goods barring those possessing military or strategic value .
 This was diﬀerent from the course that Washington embarked upon, particularly once a United States embargo was put in place in October 1960, and United States diplomats were withdrawn in January 1961 . This was followed by a U.S. embargo, and the withdrawal of diplomats in January
 Canadian Minister of External Aﬀairs, Howard Green, and the United States Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, had a very tense exchange regarding Cuba in May 1961 .
 Green emphasized to Rusk that U.S. policy was severely mistaken . Green emphasized the failure of the US-sponsored invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs . Green also emphasized that the US policy was wrong .
 Throughout 1962, a number of United States oﬃcials had made their displeasure over the nature of the Ottawa–Havana relationship quite clear to their Canadian counterparts .
 The United States Ambassador at Ottawa, Livingston Merchant, informed several Canadian cabinet ministers that Canada’s inﬂuence in Washington had declined thanks in part to ‘ostentatious divergence’ from the U.S. position on Cuba .
 Rusk argued that Canada’s position was a dangerous one . Citing the threat that Cuba posed to the region, Rusk said that U.S. public opinion was becoming anti-Canadian .
 Canada’s Cuban policy was ‘the most serious problem’�’ in terms of Canada–US relations because of the harm that it might do to the relationship. Indeed, the Canadian government said it would be ‘a very difficult time’ to deal with
 Green resolved that in public he would attempt to downplay diﬀerences over Cuba . Green resolved in public that he would try to down play down Cuba .
 The report did not advocate a change in Ottawa’s fundamental outlook on Cuba .
 It did argue, however, for a more appreciative view of Washington's stance .
 Canadian concern growing over state of state of relationship between Havana and Moscow . Canadian concern is growing over the state of the relationship between Moscow and Havana . Russia and Cuba have been accused of a series of human rights violations .
 From the Cuban capital, George Kidd passed on a wealth of information to Ottawa . The Canadian Ambassador to Cuba passed on the information to the Canadian government .
 Many of these reports, sent also to the Americans and the British, dealt with Cuba’s arms build-up over the summer of 1962 . Many of the reports were sent to the U.S. and British governments .
 In mid-August, Kidd sounded the tocsins over the increasing numbers of Soviet technicians, military personnel, and materiel arriving on the island .
 The Soviets matched these provocative actions with dangerous rhetoric, a worrying mix . It was a dangerous mix of provocative actions and dangerous rhetoric . The Soviets have been accused of using provocative rhetoric against Russia .
 TASS news agency released a statement from the Kremlin castigating U.S. policy, and repeating Moscow’s deep commitment to Cuba . On 11 September, the Kremlin issued a statement criticizing the United States .
 Kidd also worried that Cuba was now on par with Berlin as a key centre of the cold war . Kidd: It seemed logical to expect Moscow would henceforth demand a greater say over Cuban policy .
 He felt that deepened Soviet involvement could also have the eﬀect of moderating Cuban adventurism throughout Latin America . Still, he said, he felt that deeper involvement could have moderated Cuba's actions in the region .
 In this regard he reported that the Soviets, in fact, seemed to be trying to reduce tensions . The Soviets, he said, were trying to ease tensions with the West .
 Long-range missiles would not be installed in Cuba, the U.S. government says . The U.N. guarantee was heartening, especially for the Cuban people .
 The U.S. President warned the Soviets against introducing weapons into Cuba . But Soviet arms shipments continued . The United States President held a news conference .
 Kennedy had made similar pronouncements the previous week . The growing tension in Washington was picked up by the Canadian Embassy in its reports back to Ottawa . Kennedy's comments were picked up in the Canadian embassy reports .
 Kennedy's warnings, combined with Kidd’s worrying cables, worried members of External Aﬀairs . Kennedy’�s warnings, . combined with . Kidd's worrying cables .
 Soviet airplanes often stopped to refuel at Canadian airports . Green was concerned by the frequent overﬂights of Canada by Soviet airplanes .
 There was a belief in External Aﬀairs that these ﬂights were being used to transfer military technicians and personnel to Cuba . Green’s speciﬁc worry was that Canadian acquiescence was making Canada complicit in the armament of the Cuban military
 Soviet chargé was called into the Department to be told of Canadian concerns . At his request, the Soviet charge  was called to the Department .
 Norman Robertson had a wide-ranging discussion in late September with the Cuban Ambassador, Américo Cruz . In regards to Cuba itself, Norman Robertson spoke with Cruz .
 Robertson said Cuba’s alignment with the Soviet bloc has created ‘growing uneasiness and anxiety’ amongst Canadians . Robertson emphasized that this situation had created a ‘steadily worsening relations’ between the U.S. and Cuba .
 Robertson set down his thoughts on Cuba in a memorandum to Green . Robertson set out his thoughts in the memorandum . The following week, Robertson set aside his thoughts .
 Minister viewed the increasing Soviet military presence with anxiety . Hoping to oﬀer minister an assessment of the ‘situation behind the Sugarcane Curtain’
 Robertson felt that ‘there seems to be no substantial reason for terminating our present normal diplomatic relations with Cuba’ A week later, 16 October, Kennedy received startling news that Soviet missiles were being deployed in Cuba .
 Over several days they debated a number of options, including bombarding the missile sites and invading the island . The island nation is home to a range of islands .
 The course they set upon was to blockade Cuba the term ‘quarantine’ was used and then demand that the missiles be removed . The term 'quarantine' was used in reference to the use of the term quarantine .
 These measures would be announced by the President during a televised address, set for 7pm on 22 October .
 Rusk had mulled over using the Canadian Ambassador at Havana as a go-between with Fidel Castro, but the idea was abandoned . Rusk was the only point at which Kennedy and advisors considered Canada .
 Ottawa was among those governments that received a brieﬁng from the U.S. prior to the President’s address . Ottawa was one of the countries that received the President's address .
 Charles Ritchie, Canada’s new Ambassador at Washington, received information on the crisis from the United States Under-secretary of State, George Ball . George Ignatieﬀ, the Canadian representative to the North Atlantic Council, attended former United States Secretary of State Dean
 Both Canadian diplomats noted that during the brieﬁngs the need for solidarity had been underlined .
 Livingston Merchant, recently retired from the foreign service, returned to Ottawa to brief PM . Livingston Merchant is a former Canadian diplomat who served in Canada's foreign service .
 "Because this situation is so dangerous, they expected that the United Nations would become involved," says one survivor . The United Nations is expected to become involved in the situation, the survivor says .
 Possible Canadian action could then be to urge that the UN ‘conduct an on-site investigation in Cuba’ to conﬁrm the United States government’s assertion that missiles were being installed .
 Merchant’s insistence that the President would not play politics with such an important issue seemed to soothe the Prime Minister as did photographic evidence of the missile sites .
 Merchant also observed that ‘it was interesting . . that at no point, despite pointed questions, did make a commitment in this regards’ .
 Merchant presented a letter to the Prime Minister which Merchant presented . Kennedy had made some positive comments about the United Nations . Perhaps Diefenbaker did not suggest UN inspections because Kennedy, in the letter, had made a positive comment .
 This eﬀort, an ‘independent inspection’ made through the UN, would both ‘provide an objective answer to what is going on in Cuba’ and constitute ‘the only sure way that the world can secure the facts’ Hardly a
 In Ottawa, the Cuban Ambassador remarked to Alfred Pick, the head of External’s Latin American Division, that ‘he had read and liked the Prime Minister's statement in the House’ because the suggestion of an inspection ‘implied that Mr Diefenbaker
 Robert Kennedy, the US Attorney General, reported that ‘the only half-hearted response’ to their actions that the White House had received was from the Canadian Prime Minister . David Ormsby-Gore, Britain’s Ambassador at Washington, spoke with Robert Kennedy .
 Rather than being an assertion of doubt, the speech, or at least its phrasing, appears merely to have been a rather unfortunate gaﬀe . Even Diefenbaker recognized immediately .
 In a cabinet meeting the next morning he told his colleagues that the press was pestering him over whether there were any doubts about the missile sites .
 Diefenbaker averred that he, Green, and Harkness ‘had been convinced that there had been no exaggeration of the situation’ by Kennedy .
 Kennedy’s plan involved using a UN Security Council resolution as a means to seek the missiles’ removal, but he felt this eﬀort would most likely fail due to the Soviet Union's veto . Importantly, he explained that Kennedy's plan was likely to fail
 His purpose was not to compete with a United States resolution; rather, it was to put forward a proposal which could be used in the event that the Soviet veto was used .
 Diefenbaker had initially blundered by emphasizing the role of the United Nations in the way he had . His proposal was meant to compliment U.S. initiatives, and given his claims that Kennedy had not exaggerated the evidence, one can conclude that he had blundered
 Diefenbaker had signed instructions to the embassy in Washington and to Canada’s U.N. mission at the United Nations, telling these Canadian diplomats to seek out their United States counterparts .
 Ottawa’s goal was simply to put in motion an initiative which could be used if and when the Soviet veto was employed . The move was not meant to cast doubt on the United States claims .
 The British opposed the proposal because the evidence provided by the Americans seemed convincing . The British opposition was based on the evidence from the Americans .
 Norway’s representative was mildly in favour of the move, but only if it became necessary to counter Soviet denials about the presence of the missile sites . Norway's representative said the move would only be necessary if necessary .
 Ritchie also discussed the Prime Minister’s initiative with Harlan Cleveland, the Assistant Secretary for International Organizations . The State Department emphasized that facts of situation as outlined by President were not questioned by Canadian Government .
 Diefenbaker’s mission seemed aimed at doing the former, Washington would not support the Canadian scheme . As the Americans preferred the latter, the U.S. would not back the Canadian plan .
 Howard Green ‘played down’ the proposal and oﬀered his assurance that Canada would go no further in this regard without the United States . Speaking with Ivan White on 24 October, Howard Green 'played down' the proposal . Howard Green said he would not go further
 Robert Bryce, the Clerk of the Privy Council and Canada’s top civil servant, was carrying out prime ministerial instructions to determine the legality of the United States’ quarantine .
 The legality of the President’s action was ill-deﬁned and without precedent, Canada could accept the quarantine measure without acquiescing to anything illegal . Canada's study of past naval blockades concluded that past blockades were illegal .
 The DEA study, grounded in a discussion of international law, likewise noted the ‘sui-generis’ nature of the US quarantine .
 As a result, there would be nothing wrong if Canada at least oﬀered its tacit support . Canada would be better than Canada to back the U.S. President Barack Obama .
 Norman Robertson advised Canadian oﬃcials to avoid discussing the legal merits of the quarantine in public . Robertson: To avoid a potential blunder, avoid discussing legal merits in public.
 Prime Minister made no complaint when quarantine came into eﬀect, a move in line with those of other friendly nations . This advice was convincing enough to the Prime Minister .
 Canadian diplomats moved quickly to respond to a request made by the US embassy on 22 October that Canada temporarily suspend overﬂight clearances for airplanes travelling to Cuba from the Soviet Union . The request was made by Canada's diplomats .
 In a brief press conference following the Prime Minister’s address to the House that evening, Howard Green announced that ﬂights to Cuba from the Soviet bloc would no longer be permitted to land or refuel in Canada .
 ICAO rules stated that civilian airlines could not be used to transport military equipment . Canadian oﬃcials could lawfully conduct searches of planes from these airlines to enforce this rule .
 By 23 October consultations between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as well as the Departments of External Aﬀairs, Transport, National Revenue, and National Defence led to procedures establishing these searches .
 Cubana plane touched down at Goose Bay, Newfoundland, on 24 October . They were immediately put into eﬀect when they touched down .
 A thorough and purposefully lengthy search by customs oﬃcials found no strategic material, but several missile technicians were on board . The search was not complete .
 Unable to remove these men, the Canadian cabinet cleared the men to leave . The Canadian cabinet was unable to remove the men .
 A United States analysis of these search procedures concluded that they were ‘suﬃciently detailed to ensure a measure of deterrence’ The U.S. recommended that similar measures be used by countries in the Caribbean . A similar measures should be used in the region .
 NORAD requested that Canada match this level of readiness . The United States military went to Defense Condition 3 alert on 22 October . The Canadian element of NORAD is NORAD's Canadian element .
 Canada’s military passed it on to the Defence Minister; Harkness, in turn took it to the Prime Minister . As this request had come through military channels rather than a political one, it was not political .
 Diefenbaker referred the matter to the cabinet, where ministers debated whether or not to comply with the U.S. request . The cabinet met on 23 and 24 October to discuss the issue .
 Harkness again pleaded his case the following day, and again, the ministers were deeply divided . The ministers of state and state in the UK are deeply divided on the issue .
 Following this meeting Harkness presented Diefenbaker with a report showing that the U.S. military had moved to DEFCON 2, meaning the Americans were making immediate preparations for war .
 Prime Minister ordered that Canada’s air forces be readied . Canada's air forces are readied for possible use in the event .
 Harkness had already authorized an alert days before, and Canada’s military commanders had immediately complied with this secret order . The alert had been ordered by the Canadian government .
 Canadian military and the Minister of Defence had ensured that Canadian forces were ready in case hostilities broke out . So although the Prime Minister had forced a delay, the Canadian military was ready .
 While Diefenbaker was fumbling about on defence issues, Green stumbled about on television . Green stumbled around on television.
 Given the cabinet's indecision over NORAD, Green’s misstep is not surprising, however, however .
 Green’s statements in support of U.S. policy are surprising to be made of his omissions . What is surprising is that so much has been made of Green's omissions, Green said .
 Green downplays Diefenbaker’s suggestion for a UN veriﬁcation mission . Green argued that in the rush of activity this subject had come up in a hurried manner as a method of resolving the crisis .
 Green: 'I don’t think the Americans have any doubt whatever that we’re standing beside them. As Green remarked, ‘I don't think . I’m standing alongside them. That’s not the Americans,’ he said .
 Ministers advised the Prime Minister to make a further statement clarifying Canada’s stand in support of the United States action’ Diefenbaker: ‘This situation should be corrected’
 He also attacked the Soviet Union which ‘by its actions has reached out across the Atlantic to challenge the right of free men to live in peace in this hemisphere’
 Charles Ritchie and Basil Robinson called on Robert Kennedy and Secretary of State . The two men spoke in Washington, DC, on 26 October .
 Robert Kennedy was pleased to see Ritchie because he had just heard about Diefenbaker’s statement to the House of Commons . Ritchie was in the midst of a meeting with the Kennedy family .
 Ritchie handed a memorandum of conversation between Howard Green and Cuba’s Ambassador, Américo Cruz . Ritchie also handed the Secretary of State a memo of conversation .
 Rusk suggested that Green might probe Cruz further . Rusk said that Green may be looking into the case further .
 Ritchie was less than convinced that Rusk truly expected anything from this eﬀort but he advised Ottawa of it nonetheless . Ritchie advised Ottawa not to expect anything from it .
 The Secretary of State likely put more stock in this channel than Ritchie thought . Rusk was already using Brazilian diplomats as a way to communicate with the Cuban government .
 He may sincerely have wished to use Canadian oﬃcials in this regard as well .
 Canadians look on with astonishment and worry at Cuban actions . Meanwhile, in both Havana and Ottawa, Canadians looked on with shock and worry .
 Fidel Castro failed to refute U.S. charges about presence of missiles, Kidd says . Kidd worried that Castro had neglected an opportunity to calm the situation .
 Cuban Ambassador called on Howard Green; a bitter discussion ensued . Instead, Castro had ‘reiterated his readiness to die with his people but seems rather less concerned about whether they or anyone else remains alive'
 He 'expressed disappointment' that Castro had rejected any notion of UN inspections . The Cuban position implied that Havana had something to hide, he said .
 Cuba’s actions clearly alarmed the Canadian government . Green emphasized that the missiles posed a ‘grave threat to the security of the Americas’, including Canada .
 This was remarkable, he felt, because of the strong domestic pressure on the Kennedy administration to take a hard line, particularly with a mid-term election looming . The Kennedy administration was pressured to act strongly, he said .
 A detailed study of Soviet motivations, prepared in the European Division and funnelled up to the Prime Minister, also played up the provocative nature of Khrushchev’s actions . Robertson defended this measure as ‘a necessary response to clear provocation’
 Moscow’s actions therefore constituted a ‘serious threat’ towards which Washington had shown considerable moderation . Moscow's actions constituted a 'serious threat' towards the U.S. towards Russia, Washington said .
 The study noted that following the imposition of the quarantine, the Soviets had also taken a moderate position and negotiations might therefore prove fruitful . Highlighting the ongoing danger of the situation, the study noted, too .
 Charles Ritchie ominously counselled Ottawa that it appeared that a ‘second and more critical phase of the crisis’ was about to begin . Yet on 26 October there was only some vague possibility of a resolution, and so on that day there was just some vague hope of
 The next day, Radio Moscow broadcasted a message from Khrushchev to swap missiles in Cuba for U.S. missiles in Turkey . The message was broadcast by the next day .
 Ritchie rushed to the State Department to receive any information that William Tyler was willing to give . Ritchie: "William Tyler would be willing to answer questions"
 Tyler warned that meeting Khrushchev’s demand could seriously damage the NATO alliance . Tyler felt that a potential schism was outweighed by the danger posed by the missiles . Tyler: "A potential conflict with NATO could be very dangerous"
 Ritchie was buoyed by a discussion with Ormsby-Gore, who said he had received word of secret communications between the Soviet Premier and the U.S. President .
 Ritchie advised Ottawa that this news could herald a break in the crisis . After conﬁrming this development with Tyler, Ritchie said Ottawa could break the deadlock .
 Khrushchev announced on 28 October that missiles in Cuba would be dismantled . This was indeed the case . Khruschev announced that the missiles would not be dismantled in Cuba .
 Green spoke with the UN Secretary General, U Thant . Green spoke to Canada’s delegation to the UN to discuss the issue . Green also spoke to the Secretary General of the UN .
 That day, Thant had announced his intent to go to Havana to gain Castro’s consent to the establishment of a UN mission to verify the dismantling of the missile sites . Thant said he would go to Cuba to gain the consent to establish the UN mission .
 Green stressed to Thant that Canada is willing to assist in any way possible . Green stressed that Canada was willing to help in the Philippines .
 Canada would be willing to oﬀer aircrew for a UN reconnaissance mission . After conferring with Adlai Stevenson, Green informed the Secretary General that Canada was willing to fly .
 Flying U.S. airplanes painted white and bearing UN markings, these pilots would conﬁrm that the missiles were being removed . The planes were painted white with UN markings .
 Green authorized the embassy in Washington to begin discussions with the Americans on the details of securing these planes and moving Canadian pilots into position . To speed up this process, Green also authorized the Canadian embassy to begin discussing the details .
 U.S. hoped that Canadian pilots would be used for this mission, they fully expected that the proposal would be rejected . The proposal was rejected .
 Green met with the Cuban Ambassador in order to smooth the way for UN inspections . Green returned to Ottawa on 30 October .
 Green urged Cruz to tell his government that ‘it was no less in Cuba’s interests to cooperate’ with the UN than it was to oppose a mission .
 Canada would be willing to contribute in any way towards the success of the mission, he said . Cuba could thus rest assured of Canadian impartiality .
 As Cruz attacked Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson, and Dean Rusk, Green defended them as ‘voices of moderation in U.S. policies’ Green’s overture to Cruz ultimately had little eﬀect as Thant, during his meetings with
 The Americans therefore sought Canada’s help to pressure the Cuban government . The U.S. government has sought Canada's help .
 Ivan White approached Ross Campbell to ask whether Canada would be willing to ‘intervene strongly’ with the Cubans by threatening to break oﬀ relations if Cuba refuses inspections . Ivan White asked Ross Campbell whether Canada was willing to intervene strongly .
 Campbell made no commitments but did reveal that Green had already underlined Canada’s displeasure to Cruz . Campbell said that Green has already highlighted Canada's displeasure .
 White’s suggestion of using the severance of Canada–Cuba relations as a bargaining tactic met with a decidedly negative reaction within External Aﬀairs . White's suggestion of severing relations with Cuba was met with negative reaction .
 The presence of the Canadian embassy in the Cuban capital had ‘frequently proved valuable’ and to change Canada’s policy would imply that the maintenance of the relationship in the past had been a mistake .
 Robertson said the UN should be brought in to oversee the dismantling of missile sites . Robertson said it was advisable that Kidd reiterate to Cuban oﬃcials that they should dismantle the sites .
 In a cable to Kidd, Green asked him to meet with the Cuban Foreign Minister, Raul Roa Garcia, to stress that ‘it was in Cuba’s interest to cooperate’ with the U.N. Kidd .
 Kidd spoke with Roa on 31 October to again urge Cuba’s government to do its part to gain a resolution . During a meeting on 30 October, Kidd listened to the Cuban Foreign Minister denounce the idea of UN inspections .
 Cuba believed Canada was attempting to mediate the dispute between the U.S. and Cuba . The two sides met again the next day to address Havana’s mistaken belief that Canada was trying to help .
 Roa had mentioned this to Kidd during their discussion on 30 October . The Canadian Ambassador, unaware that his government had made such an oﬀer, cabled Ottawa to ask for clariﬁcation .
 Oﬃcials in External greeted this news with disbelief for at no time had they oﬀered to mediate anything . The news was greeted by disbelief for the first time .
 Cruz misconstrued Green’s comments on the importance which Canada attached to inspections . The conclusion they came to was that Cruz, lacking a ﬁrm grasp of English, had misread Green's comments .
 Instructions to correct the misunderstanding were sent to Kidd, and Ross Campbell phoned the embassy in Washington . Instructions were then sent to correct a misunderstanding .
 Kidd was busy not just in speaking with Cuban oﬃcials; he was also reporting on events on the island . Kidd was in Cuba to speak with Cuban officials and report on events .
 Throughout the crisis, Kidd had commented on the positioning of the Soviet missiles and then, once the crisis ended, the subsequent withdrawal of weaponry and personnel from the Soviet Union .
 Ottawa directed the Canadian embassy in Havana to send reports of the Cuban reaction to events and to report on whether Voice of America broadcasts were having any inﬀence .
 Despite Cuban attempts to jam the signals VOA broadcasts were being received, many Cubans were tuning in . In response, Kidd reported that despite Cuban attempts, many Cuban citizens were tuning into the broadcasts .
 He noted that assessing the inﬂuence of the broadcasts was diﬃcult, but that by making more information available, they were undoubtedly having some impact .
 ‘Pervasiveness of Cuban propaganda and its reliant patriotic themes’ was not easy to counter . Still, the ‘pervasiveness’ of Cuba propaganda and ‘patriotic themes” was not ‘easy to counter’, the study said .
 Kidd noted that a sense of relief was spreading throughout the Cuban populace, as was a worry that the 'destiny of their country had escaped Cuban hands' This latter feeling was prominent throughout government circles in Havana, and Kidd perceived deep anger towards Moscow .
 Cuban oﬃcials also appeared upset that other Latin American countries had sided with the U.S. against Cuba .
 Kidd believed that Castro, his ego bruised, would henceforth want to demonstrate ‘to Cuba, the world and himself that he is nobody’s puppet’
 Hugh Crimmins, director of the Oﬃce of Caribbean and Mexican Aﬀairs at the State Department, spoke to several Canadian diplomats ‘in the warmest and most complimentary terms’ of the reports received from Havana .
 Kennedy praised the helpful role played by the Canadian embassy staﬀ in Havana . Diefenbaker was the prime minister of Canada's first Canadian government .
 In assessing the fallout of the crisis from Cuba’s capital, Kidd was highly perceptive . Kidd was well aware of the impact of the Cuban crisis .
 Castro had noted that Cubans were coming to realise that they were ‘caught up in a situation beyond control’ The resulting anger amongst Cubans was best expressed by Castro .
 Cuban leader tried to skilfully salvage ‘as much domestic prestige as possible’ out of what was undoubtedly a ‘humiliating’ situation for Cuba .
 Anastas Mikoyan, a trouble-shooter for Khrushchev, arrived on the island to soothe Cuba’s leadership . Castro could no longer ‘disguise a frustrated rage’ at Soviet retreat’
 It seemed likely to him, though, that the Soviets and Cubans would try to keep their disagreements quiet . He said they would use all means available to avoid a breakdown in relations .
 Smith put the blame entirely on Khrushchev for the failure of this gambit . Smith predicted that Khrushov would have to answer for his mistakes . Smith said Khrushova would be forced to answer .
 Reaction to the crisis in Ottawa was overwhelmingly concerned with the impact of the events on Canada–U.S. relations . Reaction was overwhelmingly focused on the impact on Canada and the United States .
 The speech was geared towards the Prime Minister’s domestic critics who were clamouring for the government to explain why it has not stood more forthrightly beside the U.S.
 Much of the criticism that Canada’s government received for its actions or inactions during the missile crisis was from Canadians, historians have noted .
 Basil Robinson addressed these concerns with State Department oﬃcials, telling them of his government’s concern over public outrage . Basil Robinson: "We are very concerned about public outrage"
 The resulting political crisis over the nuclear weapons issue would bring down Diefenbaker’s government in February 1963 . It has been argued at the time and since, that the Kennedy administration played a role in the Prime Minister’�s downfall . The Kennedy administration has been
 A January 1963 State Department press release caused a stir by calling the Prime Minister a liar . It seems doubtful that the Americans ‘delight in scheming to obtain vengeance for Diefenbaker’s diplomatic cold shoulder’ during the missile crisis .
 There seems in fact to have been a general lack of criticism of the Canadians by US oﬃcials .
 Livingston Merchant did voice his disappointment over both the Prime Minister’s statement in the House of Commons on 22 October and his television interview a few days later . Speaking with Basil Robinson in December 1962, Livingston Merchant said he was disappointed by both the statement and interview .
 The Prime Minister’s statement of 22 October was noted, but criticism did not come from the United States likely because little was expected of the Canadians . Such assistance had pleased United States oﬃcials .
 As far as Washington was concerned, Canada, like most other countries, was largely irrelevant in the crisis . Canada was "largely irrelevant" in Washington's decision to step down from the crisis, CNN says .
 The transcripts of Kennedy’s deliberations with his advisors attest that U.S. oﬃcials gave little thought to a role for the Canadian government . The omission is not surprising given the mutual hostility between the President and the Prime Minister .
 Kennedy both sent Merchant to brief the Canadians and wrote a personal message to Diefenbaker . Still, there is something to be said for the relationship between Ottawa and Washington .
 Despite their Prime Minister’s reluctance, Canadian oﬃcials, including Green, responded to the crisis by siding with Washington . Canada played a helpful role in providing the Americans with intelligence, by monitoring flights heading towards Cuba .
 Diplomats were sympathetic to their United States ally and wary of Soviet and Cuban actions . In analysing events, Canada’s diplomats were sympathetic .
 Diefenbaker did not order a military alert until 24 October . Canada’s military, through the initiative of the Canadian Defence Minister, played its part in keeping North America secure .
 Rufus Smith, the political counsellor at the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, met with Canadian journalist Robert Reford to discuss Ottawa’s response to the crisis . Smith would draft the State Department press release in January 1963 .
 Canadian Trade Minister called Cubans ‘ﬁne businessmen’ in 1960 . Smith: ‘unfortunately’ these types of statements tend ‘to be remembered by people, particularly editors, who may forget that in fact Canada has been more cooperative with trade embargo�
 Prime Minister's 22 October statement and Green’s television interview would be remembered more than Canadian eﬀorts to support the U.S. throughout the October Crisis .
 Prime Minister advised that a reference in the speech to the Soviet Foreign Minister as being a ‘dishonest and dishonourable’ man be removed .
 Pick to Robertson, memo, ‘Views of the Cuban Ambassador on the Crisis’, 23 Oct. Oct. 2013 . Pick: ‘The Cuban Ambassador’s views on the crisis were ‘viewed by Robertson,’ and ‘views of the
