 Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and co-author Martin Dugard are hoping for another financial “killing’s” with their Killing Kennedy .
 New book solidifies popular history behind Warren Report on JFK’s murder and tearing down his character, writes Jim DiEugenio . But the new book may have a bigger agenda, he writes .
 Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly was a high school history teacher . O'Reilly was also a teacher at a time when he was in high school .
 Martin Dugard was an author who had written a few history books, e.g. about Christopher Columbus and Stanley and Livingstone . Dugard died in 2003 .
 Last year, the two men collaborated on a book about the murder of Abraham Lincoln . The two men also collaborated on the book about Lincoln's murder .
 Killing Lincoln proved to be a “killing” in another way, a financial one . Killing Lincoln was a ‘killing’ in a financial way, according to the author .
 This year is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of President John Kennedy . President Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 .
 Several writers and film producers are already preparing major projects for the 50th anniversary next year .
 O’Reilly and Dugard decided to get the jump on the occasion by trying to repeat the success of their book about Lincoln, thus, we have Killing Kennedy .
 The incredible thing about the murder of President Kennedy is that, 49 years later, we are still discovering things that the government has tried to keep secret about the case . We are still finding out things that have been kept secret for 49 years .
 The Air Force One tapes at the National Archives were incomplete . The tapes were discovered in the fall .
 They had been edited to eliminate a reference to a query about the location of General Curtis LeMay as President Kennedy’s body was being returned from Dallas .
 There are still important secrets seeping out about the murder of President Kennedy, author says . You will not find a word about any significant new evidence in this book, he says .
 In fact, in regards to the actual murder of President Kennedy, this is a book that could have been written in 1965 . This is the first time a book has been written about the assassination of JFK .
 "I could find very little, if anything, pertaining to the actual assassination that was discovered in later decades," says author . "I'm not sure what happened," he says .
 It seems to be to re-sell the Warren Commission Report’s initial assessment of the assassination to a new audience, except in an abridged version, jazzed up with some novelistic writing and some juicy tales of extramarital sex .
 It says that Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed Kennedy by himself; that Jack Ruby then marched down the Main Street ramp of the Dallas Police station and killed Oswald alone and unaided . Neither man knew each other or was part of a larger conspiracy, it says .
 Even though 4 million pages of material have been declassified since 1964, none of this matters in the least to O’Reilly and Dugard . In other words, even though 4. million pages have been released since 1964 .
 In Killing Kennedy, the Warren Commission got it right way back then and the hundreds of trenchant and book-length critiques of its faulty investigation aren’t worth considering . Killing Kennedy: The Warren Commission gets it right here .
 O’Reilly/Dugard book relies heavily on the Warren Report . Other major inquiries have shown that the Warren Commission was not just a flawed inquiry, but that it was deprived of crucial information .
 With important pieces of the puzzle missing, the commission’s conclusions were surely questionable . The commission's conclusions are surely questionable, with important pieces missing .
 O’Reilly and Dugard never mention Garrison’s investigation or the discoveries he made about Lee Oswald's activities in New Orleans in the summer 1963 . Garrison was the New Orleans DA who investigated Oswald in the city .
 The Church Committee review by Senators Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart into the failure of the FBI and CIA to fully inform the Warren Commission of relevant facts . But they also ignore congressional inquiries, such as a 1975 Church committee review .
 The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that there likely was a second gunman in Kennedy’s murder . The committee was in session from 1976-79 and concluded there was likely another gunman .
 In the 1990s, public interest in the case was renewed by Oliver Stone’s movie “JFK” and especially its dramatic use of the Zapruder film of the kill shot . Oswald was behind, not in front, of the motorcade, when Oswald was
 Oswald’s curious relationship with U.S. intelligence and right-wing activists . Much of this information was extremely interesting, shocking or explosive .
 O’Reilly and Dugard term the Warren Report one of the backbones of their work . They treat its conclusions as comparable in certainty to the evidence that John Wilkes Booth killed President Lincoln .
 To eliminate all this new information amounts to depriving readers of new evidence that challenges the Warren Commission’s conclusions, the author says . The Warren Commission's conclusions should be challenged, he says .
 Lee Harvey Oswald was portrayed in the portrayal of the Oswald case . Oswald was depicted as a hero in the story of the assassination of President Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy .
 Since the time of the Garrison investigation, until the discoveries about the CIA and Oswald in declassified files of the ARRB, there has literally been a running stream of evidence to contradict the narrow and deliberately constricted portrait of Oswald in the Warren Report .
 The FBI and CIA rehearsed their responses about Oswald’s ties to the intelligence community . Allen Dulles tipped off by Warren Commissioner, the CIA and FBI rehearsed the responses .
 President Kennedy was a sociopathic loner who, frustrated in his own personal and professional ambitions, decided to release his anger by killing President Kennedy . "That portrait was of the loner," he said .
 The problem with trying to maintain that stance today is that there is so much evidence to vitiate it, he says . The problem is that it is not easy to maintain the stance, he adds .
 Garrison walked down to the address of Guy Banister, an FBI veteran who retired and later opened up an investigative service in New Orleans . When Garrison discovered this, he found that it was also the address that housed the private detective offices of Banister . Garrison found that the address was also
 Mostly Banister monitored the activities of what he thought were leftist organizations, i.e. socialists, integrationists, communists and pro-Castro sympathizers .
 Garrison and the HSCA interviewed several witnesses who stated that they saw Oswald at Banister’s . Witnesses said they saw him at the time of the shooting . Garrison said that Oswald was not Oswald .
 Witnesses said Banister actually gave Oswald an office . Some witnesses said that Banister gave Oswald a office .
 Garrison thought Oswald made a dumb mistake by putting the address where he was supposed to be working undercover on this document . Garrison: Oswald put the address on the document, but Garrison thought it was a mistake .
 HSCA interview with Banister’s secretary reveals that Banister was very upset when he found out Oswald had done this . Banister's secretary says he was upset that Oswald had killed Oswald .
 It became exceedingly popular and went through at least five printings by 1967 . The book was published in 1967 .
 Oswald had a copy of the original version of the book, which was published in 1961 . Oswald's copy was from the first printing, done in 1961, and Oswald had it in New Orleans .
 Oswald could not have ordered this copy then since he was in the Soviet Union at the time . Oswald could have ordered it then from his home in the USSR .
 The CIA had decided to run a counter-intelligence program against the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in 1961 . The program was run by the ARRB, which was declassified through declassified files .
 This included electronic surveillance, interception of mail, and, most importantly, the planting of double agents inside that organization . Oswald was planted as a double agent in the organization, according to reports .
 This CIA program was supervised by James McCord and David Phillips . Phillips was reportedly seen in New Orleans at Banister’s office and at the Southland Center in Dallas with Oswald .
 Oswald got the outdated Corliss Lamont pamphlet through Phillips via Banister . It is possible Oswald got it through Phillips and Banister via Phillips . Oswald may have gotten the pamphlet from Phillips .
 Most people today would consider the above to be relevant information about Oswald, though not a whiff of it was in the Warren Commission and today, 48 years later, none of it is in the O’Reilly/Dugard book .
 Oswald's purported trip to Mexico City is mentioned in the book . The authors also briefly touch on Oswald’s purported visit to the country .
 Oswald went to Mexico to get a visa to Cuba, which is not entirely accurate . O’Reilly and Dugard simply state that Oswald went there for a visa, which was not entirely true .
 Oswald, or someone claiming to be him, also visited the Soviet consulate in addition to the Cuban consulate . It ignores the fact that Oswald visited both the Soviet and Cuban consularies .
 The actual objective was to gain an in-transit visa to Cuba with the ultimate destination, Russia . The goal of the trip was to get a visa for Cuba to Russia .
 O’Reilly and Dugard are just the beginning of what they will do with Mexico City . But this is just the start of what the pair will do next .
 The authors describe an argument between Oswald and Cuban consulate officer Eusebio Azcue . Oswald and Azcue were involved in an argument over a Cuban consulate official .
 Azcue went to the movies two weeks after the assassination and saw a newsreel of Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby . Azcue saw the news of the assassination two weeks later and saw it in the movies .
 Azcue was stunned because the man he saw being shot in the newsreel was not his man he argued with in Mexico City . Azcue says he was stunned to see the man being shot was not the same man he had argued with . The man was shot in a newsre
 Sylvia Duran, the Cuban receptionist in Mexico City who talked the most to the man called Oswald, later said the same thing . Sylvia . Duran also said that Oswald was the man who talked most to him in Mexico .
 She said the man she talked to was short, about 5’ 4’’s tall, and had blonde hair . She said he was about 5' 4'''" tall, 5' 6’' tall and 5' 3’" tall .
 Oswald had gone to the university cafeteria and was sitting next to him and his friends . Oswald was sitting in the cafeteria next to Oswald's friends when he was killed .
 He later struck up a conversation with Contreras about his inability to get a visa to Cuba . He said he was unable to get to Cuba because he was denied a visa .
 Contreras says the man he talked to was not the Oswald shot in Dallas . Contreas later said the man was not Oswald in Dallas, Texas .
 In passing, O’Reilly and Dugard point up another problem with Oswald in Mexico City . Oswald was killed by a bomb blast in August 1944 .
 Oswald spoke Spanish well, according to the CIA tapes . The tapes were relayed to Washington by the CIA station in Mexico City . Oswald is believed to have been Oswald's assassin .
 Whoever this man on the tapes was was, he spoke very poor, broken Russian . Making this even stranger is that whoever this man was on tapes was, it was a very poor Russian .
 Every witness who knew Oswald testified that he spoke fluent Russian . Oswald was known to speak fluent Russian, according to witnesses who knew him .
 The CIA sent tapes and photos to Washington and they were shown and played for the FBI interviewing Oswald . FBI agents said this photo was not Oswald and the voice on the tapes was not the man they interviewed .
 Any fair-minded reader, when confronted with this information, would conclude something was amiss with the CIA’s story about Oswald in Mexico City . The CIA's story was wrong, and the CIA should have been more careful .
 The Case Against Oswald is the authors’s case against Oswald . The authors' case is that Oswald should not have been allowed to stand trial in Russia . The case goes back to the authors' account of Oswald .
 The evidence in Dealey Plaza required that the actual shooting of Kennedy take place in six seconds . The Warren Commission had a problem in making a case against the accused assassin . One of the most serious problems the Warren Commission faced was that the evidence was not enough .
 Two of the three shots were direct hits on a target moving away from the marksman at a slight angle . Two of those three were direct shots on a direct hit on a moving target .
 The Commission tried to duplicate this feat with first-class marksmen from the armed services . None of them could achieve the goal .
 Oswald was not a first-class rifleman, but by no stretch of the imagination, he was a first class rifleman . Oswald was a 'first-class' rifleman according to the historian .
 Oswald’s Marine Corps colleagues were dumbfounded that the Warren Commission could state that Oswald could perform with such shooting skill because the Oswald they recalled was either a mediocre shot or worse . In fact, when . interviewed dozens of . Oswald's Marine . Corps colleagues, they said, they
 They do something that not even Vincent Bugliosi did in Reclaiming History . They do not even even mention Vincent Bugliosi .
 The Report says that “his practice scores were not very good,” and that he scored two points above the minimum to qualify in the mid-range level for shooting ability .
 Many people think the evidence is the single most important piece of evidence in the Kennedy murder case . They leave out what many people think is the evidence most of the case needs .
 The book spends several pages describing the shooting sequence in Dealey Plaza . The book includes several pages about the shooting .
 Kennedy’s entire body rocketed backward with such force and speed that it bounces off the back seat . Kennedy's entire body was catapulted into the air, sending the car careering back to the ground .
 This unforgettable sight takes place when Kennedy’s head is struck and a burst of blood and tissue explodes upward into the air . Kennedy's head was struck and the burst of tissue exploded upward .
 To any objective viewer it appears that it was this shot that caused Kennedy’s violent reaction . Kennedy was in the middle of a rage when he was shot .
 I think I understand why the authors left out this gruesome fact, while including another memorable image from the Zapruder film . The authors included another image of Zapruders in the film, which was released in 1941 .
 In a panic attack, Jackie Kennedy crawled onto the trunk of the car to retrieve a piece of her husband’s skull that has just been blown out . Jackie Kennedy was in the car when the accident happened .
 If the book had described both actions, Kennedy’s body rocketing backwards and Jackie retrieving the piece of skull from the trunk, then the overwhelming impression would have been that Oswald was not the assassin . The laws of physics suggest that a shot from behind would drive Kennedy's head and
 In describing the other shot that hit Kennedy, the authors do something startling . The authors describe the other one as the "Magic Bullet" The other shot, the one that hit JFK, is known as the Magic Bullet .
 The bullet entered Kennedy at the level of his lower neck . Kennedy was hit by a bullet that entered his neck at the time .
 During the investigation by the HSCA, a medical panel reviewed the autopsy photographs of President Kennedy . A medical panel also reviewed autopsy photos of the president .
 Anyone can see that this shot did not enter the neck, but President Kennedy’s back . President Kennedy's back was shot in the back .
 In order to preserve the story of the Magic Bullet, the authors then censor more important information . The Magic Bullet was created in order to protect the story .
 Malcolm Perry’s attempt to revive President Kennedy at Parkland Hospital by cutting a tracheotomy over his throat wound . Malcolm Perry tried to revive the president at the hospital .
 Perry said the wound in the front of the neck was one of entrance and therefore could not have been fired from the rear . The authors omit the fact that later on that day, during a press conference at the hospital, Perry said that this wound . Perry said later that day that this
 O’Reilly and Dugard also say that no bones were struck in Kennedy by this bullet . But further, they say that the bullet struck no bones in Kennedy .
 John Nichols have demonstrated if one follows the measurements for this wound given in the Warren Commission, the cervical vertebrae would have had to have been struck . John Nichols has demonstrated if . one follows . measurements for the . wound given . in the . Warren Commission .
 Method to the Distortions: Assassination of George W. Bush . Author's description of the assassination is intriguing .
 The latter was allegedly to conceal him from any intruder; the former was to supposedly rest and/or mount the weapon while awaiting the motorcade . The latter would supposedly be used to hide him from an intruder . The former was supposed to rest and or mount a weapon while waiting for the
 Oswald was seen on the second floor at about that same time . Secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald on second floor of the building . Secretary of secretary Carolyn Arnold also saw Oswald .
 Williams could not have been on the landing below the sixth floor waiting for Williams to leave, Arnold says . Arnold is correct, he could have been waiting for him to leave .
 O’Reilly and Dugard now add in something that is utterly startling. To top of the all-important list, Dugard also add in a startling revelation .
 The window at which the alleged sniper was firing from was raised only about 15 inches . Yet, photos taken that day reveal that the window was only 15 inches wide .
 If Oswald were firing from a standing position, it’s likely the shot would have shattered the glass in the window, which it did not . Oswald's shot did not shatter the glass .
 O’Reilly and Dugard have a method behind their distortions, deceptions and omissions . But, as we have seen, there is a method of their distortions and deceptions .
 Howard Brennan will give a description of the shooter to the police, police say . Brennan is believed to be the shooter .
 Brennan is accused of issuing a description of the alleged incident . But there is a further problem with the alleged issuing of Brennan’s description . Brennan is alleged to have been involved in the incident .
 Brennan allegedly gave his description to the Secret Service a few moments after the shooting . Brennan is a former HSCA Deputy Counsel . Brennan gave the description to Secret Service moments after shooting .
 All the Secret Service agents were at Parkland Hospital with the president . Yet, all the agents were with him .
 O’Reilly and Dugard write that it was Oswald alone who shot Tippit and it was the patriotic bar owner Ruby, alone and unaided, who shot Oswald . Ruby shot Oswald in the bar .
 Authors ignore new evidence in Barry Ernest’s book The Girl on the Stairs, in which he interviewed a Mrs. Ernest .
 She certified by both a TV announcement and her own wall clock that the shooting took place at 1:06. She said she saw the shooting at 1.06. A wall clock shows the time .
 The fact that the woman certified the time would eliminate Oswald as the killer, because the Warren Report stated that he left his rooming house at about 1:03, approximately a half hour after the assassination .
 It would be physically impossible, even for O’Reilly and Dugard, to get Oswald to traverse nine blocks in three minutes . Oswald would not be able to do the feat even if he had to do so .
 From the scene of the Tippit murder to the Texas Theater, where Oswald was apprehended, is eight blocks . The Texas Theater is located eight blocks from the site of the murder of Oswald .
 Jack Ruby depicts Jack Ruby killing Oswald because of his outrage at what the alleged killer of Kennedy had done . Ruby killed Oswald because he was outraged at what Oswald had done to Kennedy .
 The book curtails the picture of Ruby’s weekend . Ruby had help in entering the Dallas Police basement on Sunday, Nov., or planned on killing Oswald 48 hours earlier .
 Ruby was at the midnight press conference held by DA Henry Wade on Friday night after the assassination . O’Reilly and Dugard note that Ruby was in the press conference .
 Ruby corrected Wade when he mistakenly named the group Oswald had solicited for in New Orleans . Ruby looked to the entire world like a reporter in the back of the room, looking to the world .
 Wade named, the Free Cuba Committee, an anti-Castro organization . This was an important distinction because the group Wade named was anti-Cuba .
 Killing Kennedy does not tell the reader that Ruby was also at the police station on Saturday . Killing Kennedy is not the first time that Ruby has been at police station in the past .
 Oswald was trying to get details of when the police were going to move Oswald to another jail . Oswald was taken into custody in the early hours of the day . Oswald had been taken to a different jail for questioning .
 Ruby was at the Dallas Police station early in the morning, perhaps as early as 8:00m. Then, on Sunday morning, there was more than one report that Ruby was there . Ruby was reportedly at the police station at around 8 a.m.
 The Warren Report said Ruby came down the Main Street ramp and somehow evaded the guard there, Roy Vaughn, even though Vaughn knew Ruby . Ruby evaded Vaughn, who knew Ruby, by evading the guard .
 The HSCA discovered a new witness, one who appears to have been avoided by the Warren Commission . The Warren Commission is expected to hold another hearing in the next week .
 Don Flusche told the new inquiry that there was no doubt in his mind that Ruby, whom he had known for years, did not walk down Main Street anywhere near the ramp because he was standing against his car at the time, which was parked across the street .
 The HSCA concluded that Ruby came down an alleyway at the side of the police station . Ruby was found dead at the scene of the shooting .
 In the middle of this alley is a door that opens to the ground floor of the building . In the end of the alley, a door is opened to a ground floor door .
 Dallas Police Department chief of security that day lied about this issue . It turned out that Patrick Dean, the police chief, had lied .
 The book is literally strewn with errors of omission or commission on almost every page . Much of the disinformation focused on solidifying long-term right-wing mythology against Kennedy as historical fact .
 At the time of his death, Kennedy had committed not one more American troop to Vietnam than when he was inaugurated . On the latter point, he had committed no more American troops than he was in Vietnam .
 He was in the act of withdrawing advisers he and President Eisenhower had committed . And he was withdrawing the advisers he had committed to Eisenhower .
 Johnson reversed this plan within three months with the writing of NSAM 288 . It was Johnson who reversed it in three months .
 This contained the plans for a massive air, land and sea war against Vietnam that included the use of tactical atomic weapons in case of Chinese intervention . In case of a Chinese intervention, the plans included tactical nuclear weapons .
 This is something Kennedy would never have even entertained, let alone signed off on it . This is not the first time Kennedy has even signed off with a proposal for a presidential candidate .
 The authors throw in many stories about extramarital affairs about JFK and Martin Luther King Jr. Regarding both JFK and another historical figure featured in the book, the authors throw out many stories . The authors also throw in a number of stories about the author's affairs .
 In using the likes of David Heymann and Seymour Hersh’s discredited book, The Dark Side of Camelot, they present the most extreme tales in this regard . In using this book, the book is based on David Heyman's discredited book .
 Many people who heard these alleged surveillance tapes, like journalist Ben Bradlee, felt they were created by FBI Director J Edgar Hoover . Concerning King, many people believed King was created by the FBI .
 O’Reilly and Dugard spend many pages describing the alleged character flaws of Kennedy and King . They spend much of the time talking about their alleged flaws .
 J Edgar Hoover, Allen Dulles and President Johnson all had flaws . Hoover, Dulles, Johnson and Dulles had flaws, but Hoover did not . Hoover was the CIA Director and CIA Director of the late 1960s .
 For decades, it has been a strategic goal of the American Right to tear down the hero status of Kennedy and King . But there is no similar political need to disparage Hoover, Dulles and Johnson . Hoover and Johnson were heroes in the White House .
 The book is designed to cement the conventional wisdom about the Kennedy assassination, pander to right-wing readers and make gobs of money . It would naturally ignore all the messy evidence of CIA and FBI wrongdoing and highlight the human frailties of Kennedy and King .
 Killing Kennedy is just the latest example of O’Reilly’s lucrative decision to sell out, even on a topic that once appeared to draw his honest interest . O'Reilly's decision to kill Kennedy is another example of him selling out .
 Fonzi supplied O’Reilly with many interesting stories about the Kennedy case in the early 1990s when Oliver Stone’s film was creating a new furor .
 The stories all pointed toward a conspiracy, and some still exist today . Some still exist online today .
 O’Reilly was hired by longtime Republican operative Roger Ailes to work for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox network . O'Reilly has been accused of sexual harassment in the past of sexual assault .
 O’Reilly wanted to continue his investigative pieces on the JFK case at Fox, but these ambitions were quashed by Ailes . Ailes had cut his teeth in politics as a media consultant for Nixon's archrival, Richard Nixon, according to Baker .
 O’Reilly’s work on the Kennedy case is contrary to what he did before, he says . So today, O'Reilly is working on the case, he writes . He says today, he's working on Kennedy case .
 If it came on the first page, we would have known that a supposed homicide investigation was being supervised by a political operative with an agenda to bend the history . We would've known that the investigation was under political pressure .
 Bill O'Reilly’s Outdated ‘Killing Kennedy’ has 77 comments . I am amazed at how far leftists will go to protect their own .

 "I'm sorry to say but I now suspect your critical thinking skills are on a level akin to the Rodney King jury," says the judge . "I’m sorry, sorry, I’s sorry, but I'm sorry for this," she says .
 This claim is not even supported by the Warren Report or at least the references you site in your book don’t come near elevating Oswald to a crack shot . Interviews with Oswald's Marine buddies reveal them laughing at the very thought .
 Now I wonder if there are meta-narratives to this inexplicable charade on behalf of the Establishment to carry this tune for so long. Now I'm wondering if there is there are there there to meta-Narratives .

 When studying the Kennedy issue, I cannot help but also ponder the larger hoaxes that vex the publc, such as the Apollo PR fiasco, and the current war on terror that conveniently displaced the former war on communism . The war on terrorism is conveniently displaced from the former .
 While it is becoming more mainstream to assert the truth with JFK, it is more rare to see free thinkers to ponder the logical inferences that accompany the wider swath of false hstory as presented to us, the Proletarian fool public .

 If Oswald had stood trial, he likely would have been acquitted, author says . What I am saying is the Warren Commission is untenable, he says . Oswald would have likely been acquitted .
 Altgens #6 photo clearly shows an “Oswald” in the doorway of the TSBD at the precise time JFK is being struck by a bullet .
 We now know why Lovelady lied about being ‘doorman’ and why, under duress, he changed his story about the shirt he wore on 11/22/63 .
 Recently released, non redacted documents confirm his felonious gun running activities at Andrews Air Force Base, and his subsequent flight from Maryland which culminated in his arrest . He was arrested and incarcerated at his job at the TSBD in early January 1963 .
 According to established FBI records now available, he had been on the lam for at least a year . FBI records show that he was missing at least an entire year before his arrest .
 Everything he says has to be assumed inaccurate until proven otherwise . O,Reilly is a gasbag and everything he says is assumed inaccurate . Everything must be assumed accurate until it's proved otherwise .

 A recent American veteran was allowed into the Soviet Union, how he wound up marrying and being able to bring his wife back to the U.S. It has never been explained to my satisfaction how and why I was allowed in .
 This was after all during the Cold War which was possibly the most paranoid era in American history . This was during the most paranoia era in U.S. history .
 Oswald was able to transport a weapon to the area where Kennedy was without being observed . Oswald's ability to carry a weapon is "totally unbelievable," says author .
 We should not forget that much of the Soviet power structure felt humiliated by the Cuban missile crisis . Just as many in this discussion have raised the possible involvement of various elements of the United States power structure .
 It is not beyond the realm of possibility that there was collusion by these otherwise hostile groups . It is possible that there may have been collusion by the groups involved in the killing .
 I have no answers to the overall question of who shot Kennedy and why, but I have always been convinced that the real shooter was not Oswald, and that there was more of a motive than an unsatisfactory discharge from the USMC .
 A lot of evidence put out by conspiracy theorists proves a cover-up after the fact . However, evidence proving that the CIA/Military was involved in a plot to actually kill JFK is lacking .
 Oswald, if he was involved with anti-communists, could have been an infiltrator . Oswald was involved in the anti-Communist movement . Oswald could be involved with the Communist Party, according to reports .
 "I think if he was involved with anti-communists in New Orleans, he was trying to infiltrate them," he says . He says he thinks he may have tried to infiltrate anti-Communists .
 James Angleton of the CIA kept a Soviet defector in solitary confinement for years trying to get him to confess that he was a Soviet plant . Angleton claimed the Soviets had nothing to do with the assassination, and that Oswald was a soviet agent .
 There are many questions still unanswered and I don’t think simply saying “since the CIA covered up the fact that Oswald was not a lone gunman they must have been involved in the plot” is a sufficient answer to the questions .
 Jerry Policoff wrote about the CIA media cover-up of the JFK assassination . Read everything Policoff ever wrote about . The JFK assassination was a cover up for the CIA .
 There is a mountain of evidence pointing to conspiracy, but there is one piece that should have blown the case wide open – the Oswald imposter .

 Mr Teague was a bystander under the triple underpass and was struck on his cheek by a piece of pavement from the impact of another bullet . He was struck by the pavement from another bullet that hit him .
 In his view, the problem with the JFK case has always been the refusal of the mainstream press to countenance any serious objection or alternative to the Warren Report .
 The idea that Oswald killed Kennedy with this cheap Italian rifle, from the sixth floor–which he was not on at the time–hitting 2 of 3 direct hits, which the Commission knew was not possible, would evaporate . If the media actually carried the best critiques of the report,
 O’Reilly and Dugard are trying to somehow make this thing acceptable again . They are still trying to make it acceptable again, but it won't happen again .

 If O’Reilly came out with a blockbuster revelation, it would sell a shitload of books . It would be a good thing for the company to come up with a revelation .

 "When you add in all the deceptions I noted, that is what makes this such a bad book," he says . And when you add that, that's what makes it such a terrible book, he adds .
 Vince DiEugenio says JFK assassination "facts" that are not true are wrong . Vince says he disagrees with his claim that the book did not offer anything new and insightful into the JFK assassination debate .

 I do not come away from the book with a sense that O’Reilly thought JFK caused it to fail on his own. I do know that I did not come . I do come away with a . sense that he did not think JFK caused JFK . to fail .
 I am almost positive the book says JFK was not planning a ground war in Vietnam . Also, I'm almost certain the book . JFK was probably not planning to go on ground war .

 JFK was holding his Vietnam policy close to the chest in November 1963 . The possibly of increasing military aid, etc was not totally off the table .
 Conspiracy theorists claim JFK was not going into Vietnam so they killed him is lacking in evidence . I think the claim by some conspiracy theorists that the generals and military industrial complex knew JFK wasn't going to go into Vietnam is lacking evidence .
 JFK’s public claims on Vietnam were actually quite hawkish, it was his private ones that showed he was a practical cold warrior and that he was not going to fall into the same trap as the French .
 I feel JFK was probably killed for his Cuba policy rather than Vietnam, since no one really knew what JFK was going to do in Southeast Asia except a select few . I think JFK was killed for Cuba policy .
 I know you probably discuss a lot of it in your book but I figured I’d ask now and hope for a reply . "I'm not sure what I really want to say but I just want to know what I want to talk about it."
 No conspiracy theorist seems to want to answer questions on the assassination itself . I also have a few questions to ask about the Kennedy assassination .
 Questions need to be answered in order to get a clearer picture of the assassination . They aren’t attacking conspiracy claims-they are just questions I feel need to answer .
 He does blame JFK for Bay of Pigs . James DiEugenio blames JFK for attack .
 JFK plans to withdraw after he is re-elected . JFK says JFK is planning on withdrawing after he wins re-election . JFK plans on withdrawing from the presidency .

 "I try to present Kennedy as a break with the Cold War consensus that had developed through Truman, Acheson, Eisenhower and the Dulles Brothers," says author .

 "I do see how he challenged the traditional order but he was not, in my opinion, a dove," she says . "He was not a dove. He was not," she adds .
 He realized that the status quo was not sustainable and that if things were not done to ease tensions, war would inevitably result . He said: "If things are not done, there would inevitably be war."
 President Obama engaged in numerous traditional cold war policies, such as aggressive rhetoric . Yet, he engaged in many traditional Cold War policies, albeit mixed with reasons for hope of better relations .
 He went after Castro with a vengeance and increased the defense budget . He went on a vengeance against Castro . He increased the budget .
 His support for third world nationalism was a cold war policy to get those third world countries away from the Soviet banner . He supported third world nationalist nationalism .
 He did change the reasons for some policies but he continued many inherited from Eisenhower and Truman . He continued to carry on many inherited policies from Truman .
 JFK hoped to end tensions with the Soviet Union but he did not want to do that at the expense of looking weak, in the eyes of Americans and Khrushchev . JFK was not keen on ending tensions with Soviet Union .

 President Obama's policies were a clear break with what occurred before . But as you will see, his policies were clearly different from what happened .
