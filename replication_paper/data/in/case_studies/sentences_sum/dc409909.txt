 Some key U.S. officials had disagreed about the merits of the Brazilian proposal . Administration had tentatively decided to endorse it in light of evident tensions in Havana between Castro and pro-Soviet Communists .
 U-2 reconnaissance planes suddenly discovered that the Soviet Union was secretly installing nuclearcapable missiles in Cuba . As it turned out, however, Castro politely deºected the Brazilian initiative, and the matter had proceeded no further .
 Ad hoc group of senior U.S. ofªcials that would become known as the Excomm (Executive Committee) gathered in the Cabinet Room to consider what to do . On the afternoon of 16 October, Kennedy was presented photographic evidence of the still-secret missile empl
 Rusk was resuscitating the idea presented by the Brazilian foreign minister, San Tiago Dantas, the previous spring, but this time under far more urgent circumstances . Rusk: "In effect, Rusk has resuscitated the idea, which is similar to that of San Ti
 Rusk proposed communicating the message via the Canadian ambassador in Havana or the Cuban representative at the United Nations . Rusk's passing suggestion attracted little attention amid the Excomm’s far more extensive consideration of other options .
 Rusk put the odds of success at “one chance in a hundred, possibly, possibly” he maintained that 1.5% chance of success . Rusk: “One chance in 100, possibly"
 The literature on the Cuban missile crisis occasionally mentions, but does not seriously explore, this option . This option may have been possible, but not seriously explored, in the literature .
 Martin asked Martin to outline the contents of the oral message that would be conveyed through a third party to Castro .
 Martin explained that the message would indicate that the U.S. knew about the missile bases . He said it would then point out the implications for United States security . Martin: The message would show that the United States knew of the bases .
 It would be a “breach of Castro’s past promises, not only because the missiles were ground-to-ground weapons but also because they “obviously” were Soviet-controlled . It would characterize the deployments as a ‘breach’
 Unless Castro responds positively by then, the U.S. would be “compelled” to act to remove the missiles, Obama says . The United States would then be compelled to act, he says .
 The message would wipe out the potential military advantages of a surprise attack on the missile bases, an option favored by many Excomm members . It would also wipe out potential military advantage of an attack on missile bases .
 On 17 October, several senior advisers, such as UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, Treasury Secretary C Douglas Dillon, and CIA Director McCone submitted memoranda that noted the possibility of sending an emissary to Cuba seeking the removal of the missiles .
 Stevenson urged Kennedy to send personal emissaries to Khrushchev and Castro . Dillon and McCone urged a demand to Castro to begin the removal of the weapons, followed by air strikes if rejected .
 The alternative of a message to Castro seemed to have vanished from serious consideration . By that evening the alternative of sending a message seemed to be a serious consideration.
 Attorney General Robert F Kennedy summarized the major options as an ultimatum to Khrushchev . The options included a limited air strike without warning, a political warning followed by a naval blockade, a large-scale military strike after political preparations, or a full-scale invasion of Cuba .
 The day before Kennedy spoke, the NSC decided to delete the reference . The reference was deleted the day after Kennedy spoke . Kennedy spoke at the end of the day .
 Rusk’s initial suggestion of using the Canadian embassy in Havana as a communications channel was rejected . No approach to the Canadians took place at this stage of the crisis, despite the initial suggestion .
 By the morning of 22 October Rusk seems to have modiªed his thinking to view the Brazilians, not the Canadians, as the most suitable channel for a secret direct approach to Castro .
 President Kennedy noted the possibility of recognizing a Cuban 8.0% Cuban 8% Cuba . Stevenson's address would be the first to be delivered to the UN . Stevenson was assassinated in 1961 .
 Luís Bastian Pinto, the Brazilian ambassador to Cuba, had visited Washington only a few weeks earlier . He had impressed the State Department as a serious diplomat and reliable anti-Communist .
 Ofªcials in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs considered the Brazilian envoy to Havana both “effective” and “one of the few people who could have quick access to Castro” perhaps qualiªcations that, upon further reºection,
 Rusk certainly would have preferred not to rely on the Brazilians . The United States respected the professionalism of Brazil’s diplomats, Rusk says .
 Rusk and his associates apparently took no action to pursue the Brazilian approach to Castro . Nevertheless, over the next few days as the confrontation with the Soviet Union burst into public view, Rusk did not take action .
 Kennedy’s view: Grave problems seemed to accompany either alternative . In Kennedy's view, however, grave problems seem to accompany any alternative .
 The crisis tested Brazilian-American relations at a particularly difªcult juncture . The public phase of the crisis tested .
 After apparently successful visit of Brazilian President João Goulart to Washington in April, U.S. ofªcials had grown increasingly exasperated with Brazilian leader .
 Over the summer they had authorized both covert CIA support to Goulart’s political opponents and a quiet beeªng up of military contacts in Brazil to lay the groundwork for possible support of a coup to prevent the country from falling into Communist hands .
 In September and early October, Washington was anxiously monitoring the acute political crisis in Brazil . Goulart staged a controversial cabinet reshufufing amid rumors of coups, counter-coups, and even possible civil war in the run-up to parliamentary elections .
 Kennedy’s upcoming visit to Brazil, scheduled for November 1962, was scheduled to take place in November 1962 . They debated whether to cancel Kennedy's visit .
 Brazilians even suspected that Rusk was maneuvering to gain a hemispheric imprimatur for a subregional OAS military alliance of Central American and Caribbean countries . The Brazilians believe Rusk is maneuvering for a military strike against Castro .

 The administration sought to win support throughout the hemisphere, beginning with a rapid vote at the OAS endorsing the blockade . Kennedy decided to reveal the discovery of the Soviet missiles and his plans to institute a ‘quarantine’ around the island in his televised address on 22 October .
 Goulart initially expressed total support for Washington after he was informed by Gordon of the contents of Kennedy’s speech shortly before it was delivered . Given the recent strains, U.S. ofªcials were pleasantly surprised .
 Gordon had made the first of what would be almost daily journeys during the crisis to the president’s ofªcial residence in Rio de Janeiro, the hilltop Palacio das Laranjeiras .
 On hearing a rough translation, Goulart appeared ‘visibly shocked” by the discovery of the Soviet missiles . On hearing the translation, he said: “I’m not sure what’s going on.”
 Goulart went so far as to express surprise at the "mildness" of Kennedy's announcement .
 The Brazilian president suggested that “even stronger language” be included to condemn Soviet leaders . He erroneously believed that a blockade against arms deliveries was already in place .
 Goulart expressed ‘intense interest’ in seeing intelligence photographs from aerial reconnaissance over Cuba . He also expressed “intense” interest in seeing the intelligence photos from aerial photographs .
 He says solid proof would be “critical” to his ability to back Washington ªrmly . Given the strength of leftist opinion in Brazil, he argued, he said .
 On 18 October, Kennedy had surmised that Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and “probably” Ecuador would vote against an OAS resolution supporting a United States blockade of Cuba .
 Brazilian ambassador to the U.S. had been trying to reach Goulart for hours . He says he has received calls from Brazilians who had been waiting for hours to reach him .
 The OAS Council will convene the next day to seek support for a ‘quarantine,” the Brazilian envoy says . The Brazilian envoy had received a special summons to the White House .
 Rusk gave Campos an urgent appeal of “major gravity,” in the president’s name, to deliver to Goulart . Rusk declared that the crisis was a “vital question” for Washington . OAS endorsement of the blockade was crucial
 Rusk asked worriedly whether Brazilian opinion would grasp “the gravity of the prob22. Brazil’s political crisis . Rusk: “Brazilians are not ready to accept the gravity of a crisis in the country .
 A less cordial U.S.-Brazilian encounter took place that same Monday evening between Celso Furtado, Goulart’s leftist planning minister, and United States Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon, who were in Mexico City .
 Dillon cut short his visit to Washington to return to Washington, but not before a courtesy call on Furtado that degenerated into a shouting match . Dillon is not the president of the Senate .
 The United States record, by contrast, makes clear Dillon’s strong impression of Furtado . Dillon: The U.S. record makes clear that Furtados is anti-Americanism and parochial .
 Filled with ‘extreme anguish and apprehension,” Campos had returned to the embassy . After several fruitless hours, Campos got the president on the line well after midnight .
 Goulart asked how great the danger of nuclear war would be if the Soviet Union tried to break the blockade . Kennedy asked Campos' account of the situation and Kennedy’s request .
 Campos assured Campos that a Soviet attack was improbable in light of U.S. nuclear superiority . Campos: "The United States has nuclear superiority" Campos said Campos told Campos he would not be surprised by the threat .
 More likely is a “tactical retreat” and possible counterstrike in a theater in which the Kremlin enjoys the strategic advantage, he says . More likely, he argues, is a retreat in Berlin, Turkey, or Iran, such as Berlin or Turkey .
 Kennedy administration wanted to tone down the language and strictures of the proposals it was going to present the next day before the OAS .
 The Brazilians also hoped that a provision might be included calling for UN inspectors to visit Cuba “to verify existence or non-existence of offensive build-up” prior to adopting the full complement of sanctions . The United States desired a “quarantine” that the United
 Brazil itself moved quickly to seek a solution to the problem . Unbeknownst to Gordon, Brazil had already begun looking at a solution .
 A positive answer from Havana, Brazilians hoped, would provide them with ammunition to resist an OAS call for military action or other extreme measures . The Brazilians hope to resist military action until an investigative mission could report its findings .
 Cuba’s ambassador in Rio de Janeiro was asked point-blank by a senior Brazilian Foreign Ministry ofªcial whether missile bases existed in Cuba . The envoy agreed that UN inspections to verify their absence would be an “excellent” idea .
 Brazil’s former foreign minister Afonso Arinos transmitted the idea of an investigatory commission to the Cuban representative, Mario García Incháustegui . The Cuban stressed that he lacked instructions but expressed a positive ‘personal” reaction if the establishment of a commission
 The U.S. envoy reportedly asserted that Cuba will permit a commission of UN or of any country whatever to visit its territory and prove there do not exist nuclear arms or platforms erected to destroy U.N.’s.” — a statement whose “obvious inconsistency
 The senior BFM ofªcial, Carlos Bernardes, speculated that such statements contributed to the Cuban diplomat’s arrest when he returned to the island in early November .
 Hints of Brazil’s efforts to distance itself from Washington surfaced after the vote . The government issued a public statement that same night opposing any use of force that violated the territorial integrity of another country .
 Rumors circulated that Penna Marinho had exceeded or violated ofªcial instructions by voting in support of the quarantine resolution .
 García Incháustegui’s comments were unauthorized, contradicting the prevailing militant atmosphere in Havana . Such comments may have contributed to his replacement a week later by Carlos Lechuga .
 Cubans in 1962: "Cuba, Cuba, 1962" Cubans: "Novembro a dezembro de 1962/” "Cuban Secreto"
 Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa repeated the denial of the presence of offensive weapons on the island as late as 25 October .
 The second telegram reafªrmed the ªrst’s instruction to vote in favor of the arms embargo but added that Penna Marinho should abstain on the second paragraph, authorizing the use of force, pending the results of the UN investigation Brazil backed
 This sentence was sanitized from one declassiªed version of this memorandum . It was originally published in a declassified version of the memo .
 Goulart and Hermes privately expressed support and understanding for U.S. actions . They publicly stressed the virtues of non-intervention and the desirability of peaceful resolution of the crisis .
 U.S. ofªcials were especially miffed by Goulart’s ‘fence-straddling’ on the OAS vote . They scorned his efforts to please all sides as not only unfortunate and misguided but also unnecessary .
 By Thursday, 25 October, Goulart had decided to take a more direct role in the crisis .
 One step involved a secret letter to Kennedy, ostensibly in response to the U.S. president’s appeal to him (and other Latin American leaders) for support in responding to the Soviet missile deployments .
 The Brazilian president expressed considerable ambivalence about the quarantine . Much to the irritation of Kennedy and his advisers, the Brazilian president said he was ambivalent about it .
 Goulart underscored the need to avoid nuclear conºict and to refrain from violating national sovereignty and 33.33. The need not to violate national sovereignty is mentioned in 33.3 .
 He seemed to chide Kennedy for taking ªrm action—a sharp departure from his comments to Gordon on the night of Kennedy’s 22 October speech .
 The letter implored Kennedy to eschew military measures against Cuba that might aggravate the situation . The letter also urged him to avoid military action against Cuba .
 He warned that such a tendency would alienate Latin American public opinion . After enumerating a few speciªc examples of what, in his view, were OAS actions against Cuba that contradicted the organization's purposes, he said .
 Goulart closed the letter by alluding to the news he had received earlier in the day that Kennedy intended to cancel his planned return trip to Brazil the following month . Kennedy had said he needed to stay in Washington to deal with the Cuban situation, Goular said .
 The Brazilian leader wistfully observed that he had hoped to develop these considerations personally to the U.S. president .
 Whatever the intention may have been, Goulart’s letter must have con36.36. The letter was signed by the author of the book .
 Hilsman sensed Goulart's pique at Kennedy’s postponement of the trip . Kennedy was forced to postpone his trip to Washington .
 Hilsman also believed Goulart was seeking to ensure backing for an anticipated January 1963 plebiscite to return to a presidential system . The vote was expected to take place in January 1963 .
 President wanted to inoculate himself from domestic condemnation for uncritically supporting Washington in the event of military action against Cuba, Hilsman wrote . The move would spur mass protests in Brazil, he wrote .
 Goulart wanted to deºect criticism if Kennedy eventually backed down and accepted the missiles, suffering a hemispheric loss in prestige . Conversely, he wanted the criticism of Kennedy's decision to accept missiles .
 The CIA intercepted a message to the Brazilian ambassador in Havana . The message suggests Goulart hopes UN inspection of Cuba would afford an acceptable compromise . The CIA reached that conclusion by the early morning of 25 October .
 In another diplomatic initiative, Brazil’s UN representatives began to travel to 38 countries . Brazil's UN representatives also began to visit 38.5 countries .
 It represented a possible means of extricating the United States from the immediate crisis . It would advance a concept that had already garnered wide support in the international community, especially in Brazil .
 The proposal also dovetailed well with the idea of somehow “neutralizing” Cuba and shielding it from the Cold War . Goulart knew that the objective would be popular in Brazil . If successful, it would elevate Brazil’s international standing .
 Goulart's proposal was a hint of support from Moscow, documents show . According to Brazilian documents, one reason for the proposal was that Russia was behind it .
 One of Khrushchev’s top aides, Frol Kozlov, endorsed the concept in a lunch with the Brazilian ambassador . Vasco Leitão da Cunha was formerly the envoy to Cuba .
 Brazil could “lead the pro-denuclearization movement, certainly [including] all of Latin America and the neutralist world” in the event of a Security Council veto, he says . He points out that in the . Event of a veto, Brazil could lead the pro
 The Brazilian UN representative made the proposal in a speech to the UN General Assembly on 20 September 1962 . The proposal was subsequently submitted to the First Committee as draft resolution A/C.1/L/312.1 .
 He began circulating it, in the guise of a “suggestion,” to US, Soviet, and other diplomats, to U.S. and other countries .
 Washington normally rejected proposals for a nuclear weapons–free zone in Europe . But Rusk now showed a degree of enthusiasm in presenting what he called this “very interesting possibility” to the Excomm on Thursday morning, 25 October .
 Even before U.S. ofªcials learned of Goulart’s new diplomatic ventures, they were already reconsidering the possibility of a direct approach to Castro to see whether he might be willing to expel the Soviet troops and their missiles in exchange for a United States
 President Obama said the U.S. lied to the Cuban people; they are not going to bail him out . Point out to him that just as as the Soviets lied to us, they lied to him, they lie to the Cubans .
 "There is only one course open to him -- to expel the Soviets and their weapons, and make his peace with the OAS under their terms," says President Obama .
 The message, they believed, would exploit what was presumed to be the Cubans’ “growing awareness” of Latin American opposition to the missile installation and the Soviet Union’s unwillingness to risk war . The message was believed to have been the Cuban awareness of the missile
 The ofªcials recommended that the message even imply that the U.S. would be willing to help Castro evacuate Soviet military forces or overcome resistance by them .
 The paper noted that “if the Castro Government considers that it has no freedom to act because of the presence of Soviet technicians, we would be prepared to undertake to deal with this problem”
 "We would have to give some assurances, regardless of whether we intended to 50. We would have had to . We would . have to . given some assurances," he said .
 Secretary Rusk called attention to the relationship between our quarantine and Soviet-Cuban relations . The quarantine was a result of a quarantine between Cuba and the Soviet Union .
 The Cubans would not be able to survive in political isolation, must henceforth rely entirely on the Soviets . Cubans must now rely on the Soviet Union for their survival, writes CNN's John Defterios .
 He suggested we might ask the Brazilian Ambassador in Havana to tell Castro that there was little for Cuba in being tied permanently to the Soviet Union . He suggested that we might also ask the Brazilian Ambassador in Cuba to tell him that there were little for Cuban citizens to be tied to Soviet Union
 An appeal might be made to Castro to step aside so that a new government might break this complete dependence from here on out on the Soviet Union . Castro's government is dependent on Soviet Union. Castro should step aside .
 Brazil sees itself as a peacemaker in the Cuban situation, proposing that the UN undertake denuclearization of Latin America . Brazil has proposed denuclearizing of the region .
 Rio feels this would permit Cuba and the Soviet Union to save face, thus diminishing the danger of direct confrontation . Rio says this would allow the Soviet-Cuba relations to be saved face . Rio: "This would allow us to avoid direct confrontation"
 The Brazilian Ambassador in Washington cabled his foreign ministry that “according to reports” USSR Deputy Foreign Minister Frol Kozlov supported this idea . Brazil's ambassador in Washington said the idea was supported by the USSR .
 State Department of .cials supported the Brazilian denuclearization plan at the UN . The plan drew mixed reviews, especially from the military, during an extended discussion .
 No transcript of Rusk’s comments exists, because Kennedy did not turn on the taping system until he later entered the room . Kennedy didn’t turn on taping because he didn't turn it on for first time .
 They also worried that if the zone were extended to Africa, it would provoke French opposition in light of Paris’s nuclear-testing facilities .
 Rusk conceded that the proposal might “hinder the transit by air of nuclear weapons in Latin America” and bar the storage of nuclear warheads in the Canal Zone . Puerto Rico might be exempted and that, if necessary, the U.S. could allow the French to test
 Rusk argued that a nuclear weapons–free zone represented a “face-saving” means for Moscow to withdraw the missiles . Rusk argues that, despite these problems, it would be “wise” to back the Brazilian plan .
 If Moscow refused to accept the proposal, its rejection would be on the record before Washington resorted to military action against Cuba . The proposal would be made public before the U.S. military action .
 Presidential speechwriter Theodore Sorensen also expressed interest . OAS endorsement of the plan would legitimate U.S. military action to destroy missiles if Cuba refused to go along .
 The crisis had raised the basic issue of whether the U.S. was willing to live with the Castro regime . The president and others in his administration remained loath to make that concession .
 Scholars have disputed whether Kennedy was in fact moving toward some form of military action against Cuba even before the discovery of the missiles in mid-October . The administration had been stepping up the ‘Mongoose’ sabotage operations .
 As recently as late September, Rusk had told Latin American foreign ministers that although the U.S. did not inherently object to Cuba’s internal social and economic system, it did not object to its ties with Moscow 56.
 The discussion of the Brazilian denuclearization plan’s military implications was deleted from the minutes when they were declassiªed in 1988 .

 The implication was that a ‘guarantee’ for Cuba would be a reasonable concession if it brought the removal of the missiles without a war . The implication is that a guarantee would be reasonable if a war was not fought .
 The United States, as a signatory of the 1947 Rio Treaty as well as the UN Charter, was already formally bound to respect Cuba’s territorial integrity . Rusk readily assented, noting that in the absence of some violent provocation the U.S. was already bound to
 Rusk raised anew the option of a direct diplomatic approach to Castro in Cuba . Rusk noted a legal obstacle to a potential invasion of Cuba . At that point, Rusk pointed out the legal obstacle .
 He gave Kennedy a draft cable he proposed to send to Gordon in Rio de Janeiro for transmission to Havana via the Brazilians . Kennedy gave the draft cable to Gordon for transmission of Havana .
 If Castro broke with his Soviet allies, the U.S. would abandon its plans to attack Cuba and would consider “many changes” in its policy toward Havana . That means an acceptance of the continuation of socialist rule on the island and the dropping of the United States economic embargo
 The world now knows without any question and in great detail, the nature and size of the buildup of Soviet offensive missile capability in Cuba . The world also knows without question and a great detail the nature of the build-up of Cuba's missile capability .
 The action of the Soviet Union in using Cuban soil as sites for offensive nuclear missiles has placed the future of the Castro regime and the well-being of the Cuban people in great jeopardy . The future of Cuba's Castro regime is in jeopardy, writes Julian Zelizer .
 The Soviet Union is turning around its cargo ships in face of the U.S. blockade . The countries of the hemisphere have authorized the blockade . Soviet Union has turned around cargo ships .
 The Soviet Union has put out feelers to allied governments for exchanges of their position in Cuba for concessions by the NATO countries in other parts of the world . Not only is the Soviet Union failing to support Cuba on this matter, but numerous feelers have been put out by high Soviet of
 You are not only being used for purposes of no interest to any Cuban, but deserted and threatened by betrayal . Thus you are . not only . being used . But you are not . only being . used to purposes no interest . to any . Cuban, you are deserted and . threatened
 Work is proceeding rapidly to complete and make operational the offensive nuclear missile installations and to assemble the IL-28 bombers . It is also well known that work is continuing to complete .
 The threatened countries clearly cannot sit still while the threat against them is being increased in this fashion . The threat against the countries is increasing in the form of terrorism .
 President Kennedy has said publicly that only two issues were nonnegotiable between Castro and the U.S. are nonnegotiating issues . Castro might recall that President Kennedy said only two of those issues were not negotiable .
 This view will be shared by other members of the Inter-American system . This view is expected to be shared in the coming weeks .
 Of course this means giving up the offensive nuclear capability being established in Cuba and sending home Soviet military personnel, on which help can be given if needed .
 Cuba's relations with the OAS countries, including the U.S., could be affected by the actions of the Cuban government . From such actions many changes in the relations with Cuba could be made, Cuban officials say .
 Time is very short for Cuba and for Castro to decide whether to devote his great leadership abilities to the service of his Cuban people or to serving as a Soviet pawn in their desperately risky struggle for world domination by force .
 If Castro tries to rationalize the presence of these missiles as due to Cuban fear of a U.S. invasion, Ambassador Batian should reply that he is conªdent that the OAS would not accept an invasion of Cuba once the missiles were removed .
 Rusk responded, rather lamely, that it would be the Brazilians saying it, not the Americans . Rusk said it would not be the Americans saying it . The Brazilians are Brazilians, not Americans .
 Rusk’s argument with CIA Director McCone the previous spring and again at the Special Group in August . Before the president could render a ªnal judgment, Rusk proposed a deal with Castro .
 "Long before these missiles were there, his link with the Soviet Union and the use of Cuba as a base for operations to communize all of Latin America was a matter of great concern to us," says President Obama .
 "The missiles aren’t there, but still this situation that has worried us so much for the last two or three years goes on," he said . The missiles aren't there, he said. "Still this situation ... goes on"
 McCone said it was important “to get rid of these missiles,” it was equally important ‘to have the Cuban people take over Cuba, and take it away from Castro’s .
 The draft is unsigned, but a subsequent cable indicates it was drafted by Edwin M Martin . The draft was signed by Edwin Martin .
 Robert Kennedy wondered if the U.S. would still be free to act against Cuba if Castro continued to send weapons to Venezuela or Colombia or if an uprising erupted on the island . Kennedy wondered whether the United States would still act against Castro if he continued sending weapons to Colombia or an uprising
 National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy and Kennedy cut the talk short and resolved the argument in Rusk’s favor .
 The “very simple, basic structural purpose of this whole enterprise,” Bundy said, “is to get these missiles out . Bundy: The ‘basic structural purpose” of the mission is to get missiles out. Bundy: "The very simple, very basic structural
 The State Department transmitted the eight-point message to the U.S. embassy in Rio de Janeiro . Kennedy gave his approval, and at 2m. on 26 October the State Department, over Rusk’s name, transmitted the message .
 The president concluded that Bastian Pinto seemed the best candidate for the job . The cable explained that the president had concluded that “the time has come for . representative of a friendly county to discuss with Castro alone RPT alone”
 The cable instructed Gordon to stress to the Brazilians that they must handle the matter with the “greatest discretion” and that American ªngerprints on the initiative must be assiduously concealed .
 Rusk eviexpressed his dislike of a situation involving continued control of Cuba by Castro . Rusk said he was concerned about the situation in Cuba .
 For the moment, however, the secret overture to Castro was held in abeyance . The overture is still in place .
 Rusk’s cable had instructed Gordon to pass the message to Prime Minister Hermes “as soon as possible” for transmittal to Havana . For reasons that remain unclear, the U.S. envoy did not act on these instructions immediately after they reached him .
 Rusk presented with a new option for a diplomatic channel to communicate directly with Castro, this one involving Canada . One possible reason for the delay was that Rusk that afternoon had been presented with the new option .
 The Canadian ambassador in Washington, Charles Ritchie, saw Rusk at 3:30 on Friday afternoon . He informed him that on Thursday Cuba’s envoy to Canada had called on Foreign Minister Howard Green to declare Havana’�s readiness to “ght to death�
 In interviews, Gordon had no explanation for the delay in acting on the cable . Gordon: "There is no reason for this delay in action"
 Lincoln Gordon interviews Lincoln Gordon, interviews, Washington, DC, 5 February 1998; and 16 January 2003 . Lincoln Gordon: "I am not afraid to be afraid to go out of the country"
 This Canadian-Cuban episode is brieºy noted in Martin, Kennedy and Latin America, 431. Canada-Cuba episode is noted in 431 .
 He suggested asking the Canadian ambassador in Havana to “probe the actual Cuban position,” especially if he were able to see Castro alone, perhaps during a social occasion .
 Many U.S. ofªcials were annoyed at Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker for what they regarded as his grudging backing during the missile crisis . They apparently trusted Ottawa more than Rio de Janeiro on matters pertaining to Cuba .
 Rusk’s cable to Gordon on Friday afternoon containing the secret message for Castro had crossed paths with a message from Gordon to Washington reporting on a conversation the previous day with San Tiago Dantas, the former foreign minister, who had “apparently regained his position as
 Ambassador Gordon: Dantas basically was returning to his “favorite theme” of neutralizing Cuba . Ambassador Gordon had pushed at the Punta del Este conference the previous January . He had pushed the idea of “some form neutralization of Cuba’s Cuba .
 Under this scenario, Havana would drastically cut its armed forces and eliminate the corresponding weapons . Havana would stop its subversive activities in Latin America in exchange for a formal non-invasion pledge from the rest of the hemisphere .
 Like Nehru, Dantas is living in dream world of own creation, says Nehru . My guess is that he is like Nehru: 'I'm living in a dream world'
 At same time, might be very useful to have GOB effort to seek such terms, which would certainly be great improvement over situation of last 12 months if accepted, while if rejected—as likely—would help educate GOB through process of frustration .
 The Cuban delegate to the UN, García-Inchaustegui, informed his Soviet colleague, Valerii Zorin, that the plan had achieved ‘great currency” among Latin American countries . The plan was presented to the acting UN Secretary General, U Th
 The Brazilian envoy, Arinos, told his Cuban counterpart that the plan also represented a way for Havana to “avoid humiliation” if it were forced to give up missile bases . García-Inchaustegui retorted that the scheme should cover all foreign military bases,
 Gordon warned Dantas that any Communist attempt to include Guantánamo would scotch the deal . The Brazilian 74-year-old died in the wake of the war . Gordon warned that any attempt to expand the military base would be scotched .
 The KGB was telling the Soviet Presidium that the United States had rejected the idea,77 whereas Brazil’s delegate at the OAS in Washington was reporting optimistically that both United States and Soviet ofªcials were showing positive interest in denuclearization plan .
 The optimism expressed by the Brazilian representative was not shared back in Rio de Janeiro . The Brazilian representative expressed his optimism .
 Earlier that day, the Brazilian government had received a “quite grave forecast of the current situation” from its envoy in Washington . The envoy had warned that the crisis might soon escalate dangerously . The Brazilian government says it has received a "quite grave" warning .
 The U.S. government is “gradually preparing the ground” to remove missile bases, ambassador says . Ambassador Campos says the blockade has been successful in preventing further shipments of offensive arms to Cuba .
 He predicted that Washington would soon issue a clear ultimatum to stop work on the installations . The U.S. military would either bomb the sites, expand the blockade, or launch an outright invasion, he said .
 It is possible, he says, that Moscow is deliberately continuing work on the missile bases to goad the U.S. into an attack . The action would give Moscow the political upper hand for action elsewhere, he said .
 Campos apparently relayed to Goulart a report that the U.S. government had decided to take military action unless work on the missiles in Cuba halted within the next two days . The cable gave no precise timetable, but Campos gave no timetable .

 Campos’s alarming cable prodded Goulart and his aides into further action . Campos said the U.S. had given a 48 hour ultimatum to Cuba to stop base construction under pain military action .
 In case to the contrary works will be suspended there would be a propitious climate for conversations of high level to follow for the Secretary General of the United Nations .

 Low-level U.S. reconnaissance overºights are fanning Cuban fears of a military assault at any moment, Brazil says . The Brazilian Foreign Ministry dispatched this message to Havana .
 Bastian Pinto urged the Brazilian leadership, in parallel with actions being taken by Yugoslavia, to contact Castro to urge a peaceful resolution to the crisis . Pinto: "Brazilian leadership should contact Castro on 27 October, 27 October"
 The Yugoslav ambassador quoted the Cuban president as expecting an “inevitable” U.S. attack . Dorticós expressed readiness for previously unacceptable concessions so long as Cuba’s security were safeguarded by international guarantee .

 Kennedy vetoed a retaliatory strike against the SAM site that brought down the aircraft . The action struck some U.S. ofªcials as a sign that Moscow had decided to risk escalation .
 Khrushchev had proposed a trade of U.S. Jupiter missiles in Turkey for Soviet missiles in Cuba . Washington rejected the proposal as an unacceptable concession to blackmail .
 Pressure mounted on Kennedy, especially from the JCS, to order an invasion of Cuba . U.S. military forces massed in southeastern United States and in the Caribbean around Cuba .
 Day-long discussions within the Excomm yielded a decision by Kennedy to send Khrushchev a letter that ignored the demand for a swap for the Jupiters in Turkey . The Soviet Union would withdraw the missiles from Cuba in exchange for a U.S. non-invasion
 The letter purported to embrace the terms of the lengthy message Khrushchev had sent to Kennedy late on 26 October . But the U.S. president and his advisers, well aware that the Soviet leader had only implied such an ar86. The U.K. president was well aware
 Brazilian ofªcials suspected that the “delays in the delivery to Embassy of our messages, of vital importance at this moment, are deliberate,” and instructed Bastian Pinto to make an “energetic protest” to the telegraph company .
 At this key moment, the president was ready to consider almost any gamble, no matter how implausible, that might provide an alternative to war . At this moment, President Obama was at a moment of profound concern, anxiety, even dread .
 Kennedy authorized three separate secret diplomatic initiatives that evening in a last-ditch effort to secure a political resolution to the crisis . Outside the Excomm’s awareness, it appears, Kennedy authorized the actions .
 Robert Kennedy’s meeting with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin has been generally known since shortly after the crisis . New evidence from Russian archives has added important details of the meeting .
 Robert Kennedy provided oral assurance that the U.S. would take out the Jupiters from Turkey within four to ªve months if Khrushchev withdrew the offending Soviet missiles from Cuba . Kennedy was under pressure to authorize a military strike .
 A second secret overture to Moscow at the height of the crisis was not revealed until 1987, when Rusk recounted it in a letter to the organizers of a scholarly conference on the crisis .
 The proposal urged U Thant to issue, in his own name, an appeal to Washington and Moscow calling on them, in the interests of peace, to remove their respective nuclear missiles .
 Kennedy's appeal would allow him to, in effect, accept his own proposal, but would sugarcoat the concession of a simultaneous public swap by having it appear to come from the international body . Kennedy would then appear to accept his proposal .
 Third secret overture has been unknown until now . The Albino Mission is a mission to find out what the mission is called .
 At approximately 9:45m., Rio time, on 27 October, Assistant Secretary Martin telephoned 88.5m. Rio time . Assistant Secretary of State Martin said he was 'surprised' by the call .
 Gordon then summarized the message to be passed to Castro, “emphasizing that talk must be with Fidel alone” and that the “instructions must go by courier direct to Bastian Pinto” in Havana .
 The embassy had “typed on plain paper” to conceal its origin, Hermes said . He then gave Hermes the Portuguese translation of the eight-point message .
 Gordon’s urgent midnight midnight request to intercede with Castro was a striking departure for American foreign policy . After almost three years of ambivalent and even hostile U.S. reactions to Brazilian efforts to mediate between Washington and Havana, it was a dramatic opportunity for Brazil�
 Hermes naturally welcomed the opportunity to play this potentially crucial role at the height of the most acute international crisis in many years . The role would please both the United States and friends of Castro who wished to safeguard Cuban sovereignty and security .
 Successful mediation also would showcase Brazil’s ‘independent’ posture . Successful mediations would showcase the country's “independent” posture .
 Hermes says his government has already been acting to prod Cuban leadership to moderate its position .
 He said he had promised the Cubans that if they agreed to remove the missile bases under UN inspection, Brazil would defend Cuba’s right to be secure against U.S. intervention .
 Hermes informed Gordon that a few hours ago he had received from Bastian Pinto a cable indicating that Roa had conªded that the Brazilian government’s warnings and urgings had ‘heavily inºuenced” Havana’�s decision
 Goulart had told Gordon he was considering sending Dantas to the UN to bolster Arinos’s efforts . That same day, in another sign of Brazilian diplomatic activism, had told him he had considered sending him to the United Nations .
 U.S. envoy “pointed out certain essential differences, notably effort to appeal personally to Fidel to divorce himself from Soviet control,” the envoy said . The envoy was referring to previous talks with Dantas and evidence some months back of friction between Fidel and Russians .
 Hermes responded that Tito's position like Tito’s was far better for Fidel than that of János Kádár or Grotewohl . Hermes said that if Fidel had any statesmanship he would be most interested that Lenin in similar circumstances would remove Soviet
 Only cable from Bastian Pinto that Saturday evening located in Brasília archives contains no such comment by Roa .
 Gordon was concerned about the danger of leaks and was acutely aware of the political sensitivities at home . Gordon was keen to protect the country from leaks, he said .
 Khrushchev’s agreement on Sunday morning to remove missiles from Cuba under UN supervision alleviated the immediate crisis . The situation remained tense, and the secret Brazilian mediation effort went forward .
 Fidel Castro was outraged at Moscow for what he regarded as an ignominious retreat under U.S. pressure . He was even more upset that Khrushchev had agreed to take out missiles under UN inspection without consulting or even informing Cuba . Castro issued a series of non-negot
 These “ve points” would have required the U.S. to end its blockade of Cuba, lift economic sanctions, halt subversive activities and “piratical raids” being staged from United States territory . They would have included lifting economic sanctions and withdrawing from the Guantá
 Roa welcomed the proposed visit of Goulart’s special emis95. Referring “at length to the important and sympathetic role of Brazil in the present crisis,” Roa said .
 The handful of United States ofªcials who had been informed of the covert diplomatic initiative anxiously awaited the outcome of the outcome .
 Gordon received a disturbing indication that the Brazilians were not properly handling the overture . By Monday afternoon, even before any report of Castro's conversation with Castro came in, Gordon received what he considered disturbing . Gordon: Brazilians are not properly handled .
 Upon arriving at the Laranjeiras palace, the ambassador found Goulart in a celebratory mood . The ambassador was in a happy mood .
 President Obama's comments come from a leader whom Washington found increasingly mercurial and unreliable . Such warmly supportive comments from Washington would have gratiªed Gordon .
 Castro was less pleased when Goulart informed him that Albino Albino (whom United States ofªcials regarded as ‘leftist’ and ‘anti-American”100), rather than Bastian Pinto, would be having the conversation .
 Excomm transcript, 29 October 1962, 10:10 p.m., in May and Zelikow, eds., Kennedy Tapes, p.8.m. Excomm Transcript, 29 Oct. 1962, in May . Excomm transcripts: Kennedy, Kennedy, Nixon,
 Goulart promised to report to the American “promptly” on Wednesday morning once Albino returned from Cuba . Albino will return to the U.S. on Wednesday .
 Gordon’s patience with the Brazilian president, however, dropped precipitously . After the meeting with Goulart, Gordon's patience with Brazilian president, and his conªdence in the Brazilians’ ability to serve as mediators for such a delicate initiative
 Former foreign minister Dantas called for safeguards of Cuba’s security and sovereignty if Havana would abjure subversion in the 101.1. Cuba .
 Hermes briefed seven parliamentary parties on the government’s diplomatic approach to the Cuban situation . Hermes briefed 7 parliamentary parties .
 Campos writes in his memoirs, Kennedy asked him how Brazilian public opinion was reacting to the crisis . Campos: Kennedy summoned him into his private study and asked how Brazilians were reacting to crisis .
 Kennedy laughed heartily, Campos recalled, and asked one of his assistants to jot down this all-too-apt bon mot . Another exchange, which Campos immediately recounted in a cable to Hermes but did not later mention, provoked less amusement .
 Multiple accounts of the conversation that ensued have now surfaced from U.S., Brazilian, Russian, and Yugoslav sources .
 Goulart’s envoy sent a cable to Brazil containing a terse account now available from the Foreign Ministry archives in Brasília . The talk lasted more than an hour .
 Albino’s telegram is consistent with, but far less detailed than, the version given by Hermes to Gordon in Rio de Janeiro two days later quoting from his own ‘full notes” of a sealed letter from Albino .
 Gordon immediately relayed this account to Washington,112 and two weeks later he was shown Albino’s original fourteen-page handwritten text . Gordon immediately relented this account and relayed it to Washington .
 Castro relayed the account to the Soviet ambassador in Havana, Aleksandr Alekseev, in a telegram that has since been released by the Russian Foreign Ministry archive . Another, far terser account was given by Castro to the Russian ambassador in Cuba .
 Alekseev’s cable reports that Castro had identified “da Cunha, a Brazilian general,” as the one who relayed the personal message from Goulart .
 A summer 2000 trip to the Brazilian archives failed to settle the matter deªnitively . Unfortunately, a summer 2000 visit to the archives failed .
 There appeared to be a gap from 29 October to 5 November in his dispatches from Moscow . There was time enough to undertake an urgent secret mission to Cuba to assist the Brazilian mediation effort .
 In meetings with U Thant, Castro was “in a bitter mood” and angrily denounced proposals for international inspections of the dismantling of the Soviet nuclear missile installations as violations of Cuba’s sovereignty . Castro was in a ‘bitter mood’ when he met with
 In Havana, on 30 October, U Thant saw Albino Silva and Bastian Pinto in addition to other foreign diplomats . The French president visited the Cuban capital in October .
 Albino apparently did not have any further meetings with Castro . Albino was seen off at Havana airport by Foreign Minister Roa .
 In a message for transmittal to Goulart, Roa sought Brazil's support in the UN for Castro’s ªve points, including the deal-breaking Guantánamo demand, as a basis for any negotiations .
 Albino urged Castro to follow the example of Yugoslavia and non-alignment as the only plausible escape from Cuba’s predicament . According to the Yugoslav documents, Albino had urged Castro . Albino said non-aligned Cuba was the only way to escape the situation .
 Albino insisted that despite taking a tough stand on Guantánamo and inspection, Castro had been “very honest to him and grateful” for Brazil’s initiative .
 The general predicted that his mission would succeed in persuading Castro to adopt Brazil’s suggestions .
 Under Goulart’s leadership, the policies might well carry Brazil toward an aggressively neutralist role in internationalist affairs .
 A breakthrough with a “recalcitrant Castro” would remove the obstacle to a U.S.-Soviet settlement . Wallinger noted that a breakthrough would pave the way toward broader acceptance of Brazil’s scheme to denuclearize Latin America .
 A breakthrough would also give a boost to the concept of inspections in general, he added . Moscow and Washington could overcome one of the main stumbling blocks to a nuclear 127-plus nuclear deal .
 Wallinger stressed the role of internal Brazilian politics in the whole affair . Wallinger: "Internal Brazilian politics" is key to the success of Brazilians .
 Gordon confronted Prime Minister Hermes about the Brazilian government’s handling of the missile crisis in general and the Albino mission in particular . Gordon confronted him on 4 November .
 Wallinger said Khrushchev’s 28 October agreement to withdraw Soviet missiles had “provided the opportunity they were seeking” to “take some more positive stand, without seeming to abandon their ‘independent’‘ foreign policy,” Wallinger wrote .
 Ambassador Bastian Pinto, who was already acquainted with Castro, wanted to explore Castro reaction to clear statement of dangers and disadvantages of Cuban ties with USSR and possibility of better alternatives for them .
 GOB had given maximum publicity to sending of special emissary, with newspaper stories about mediation of a type of type which could well add to Castro prestige and perhaps fortify his intransigence .
 GOB had shared with us strong support of idea of UN inspection, but had not yet publicly criticized Castro’s refusal to accept it . Castro refused to accept the idea of a UN inspection .
 Goulart and Albino boasting of success of mission quite perplexing, only explainable as design to mislead Brazilian public opinion, since in fact mission seemed to be a failure .
 Hermes vetoed a proposal by the Brazil’s OAS delegate to publicize the Albino mission . He complained that the mission had “not had the desired repercussions” in Washington, Hermes says .
 Hermes expressed conªdence that all three issues could be resolved . Hermes expressed hope that the three issues will be resolved in the near future .
 Khrushchev’s emissary, Anastas Mikoyan, would induce Castro to accept ‘some form international veriªcation,” if necessary . If necessary, he would promise extra Soviet economic aid to Cuba, he said .
 Hermes claimed inspection of Cuba could be accomplished through some multilateral scheme . Hermes claimed that inspection could be done through some multi-ilateral scheme, either to monitor a non-invasion pledge or as part of the proposed Latin America denuclearization plan .
 Hermes described the Albino mission “as only ªrst step in continuing diplomatic effort which he hoped we would support,” although he did not specify what the next steps might be . Hermes: "Albino mission only the only step"
 Hermes is ingenuous and not overly intelligent, ignorant Cold War realities, he says . Hermes is trying to reconcile recent events with romantic that Castro mere Socialist reformer who may have key to what Latin America needs .
 U.S. objection to Castro is not simply Capitalist aversion to Socialism, says author . As old-fashioned academic Socialist himself, it's hard to believe .
 The Brazilians inspired an attempt by U Thant to promote a compromise inspection formula . Neutral countries stationed in Havana would serve on a commission to verify the dismantling and departure of the Soviet missiles .
 The Cuban government has refused to allow a formal UN inspection committee . Such a move was hoped to circumvent the Cuban government’s adamant refusal to allow such a move .
 Arinos advanced the idea informally to Cuba’s new UN ambassador, Carlos Lechuga . He then suggested it to Thant on 6 November, letting him circulate it as his own to enhance its prospects .
 U Thant immediately did so, modifying it to suggest that Latin American ambassadors carry out an inspection . The move was made by the South American country .
 At an Excomm meeting on 7 November, Rusk called the idea “a help but it is not complete” Rusk sent instructions requesting that the plan be beefed up to include technical support and freedom of action for the envoys .
 Gordon softened his judgment of the Albino mission after Goulart showed him Albino’s 14-page handwritten report of Castro . Gordon: “The mission is a mission to find out what happened to Castro. It's a mission that's important for the U.S
 Albino put “more relative emphasis” on accepting UN observers and “less on detaching from Soviets” than Washington might have preferred . Albino had taken a “perhaps more cordial” tone than Bastian Pinto would have, he says .
 President Obama presented the “main points” of the U.S. secret démarche . He did not present the ‘main point’ of the United States secret .
 He mentioned that an effort was under way “to sell the idea of choosing any ªve Ambassadors,” but the results are not yet known .
 Two days later it became clear that the follow-on effort had been unsuccessful . Two days after it was announced, it was clear that it was unsuccessful .
 Castro rejected any unilateral inspection as an intolerable infringement of Cuba’s sovereignty . On 14 November, in response to a message from U Thant on 12 November urging acceptance of inspections by a mixed delegation of Third World ambassadors .
 Khrushchev himself had had “no objections” to the use of neutral ambassadors as inspectors “because we had no doubt about their good will toward Cuba,” he said . Castro vetoed the idea, but Khrushchchev’s annoyance, to Khrush
 The issue was soon superseded, in any case, by the U.S.-Soviet arrangement to have the departure of the missiles monitored by United States .
 Brazil labored far more aggressively to push its other diplomatic endeavor at the UN, the Latin American denuclearization plan . Leaders claimed the plan could allow the Soviet missiles to be removed and an inspection regime to be set up that would prevent reintroduction of the weapons .
 Kennedy administration disappointed with Brazil's handling of mediation mission to Havana . U.S. gave cautiously positive response to denuclearization effort . Draft resolution modiªed to take account of United States concerns such as transit of nuclear weapons through Panama Canal .
 The Kennedy administration relied on Brazil to assess Cuba’s reaction to the proposal .
 Rusk said that this should be done even before all the details of the proposal were worked out . Rusk: "Brazilians should un140.000" Rusk also said that the “Brazilians” should be un140 .
 Poles expressed strong private support to Brazilians for raising a concept similar to the Rapacki Plan . As before, however, Havana derailed the plan . Poles expressed support for mediation, though warning that Castro’s ‘rigidity’ constituted the main obstacle .
 Cuban delegate at the UN declared that Cuba was “very much in favor” of the idea of “denuclearized or atom-free” zones . But he insisted that the concept should cover the entire planet .
 Bastian Pinto sounded an optimistic note after a conversation with Cuban Foreign Minister Roa on 9 November . Despite this problem, Bastian said he is optimistic about the situation in Cuba .
 Bastian Pinto said that Roa had even “clearly insinuated” a willingness to drop the Guantánamo demand . Pinto: Roa even ‘clearly’s insinuated that he would drop the Guantanamo demand . Bastian said Roa
 Kennedy referring to Soviet concerns about U.S. nuclear bases in Turkey and elsewhere along its own periphery . Kennedy was referring to ongoing negotiations aimed at a veriªable nuclear test ban .
 The amendments included the extension of the scheme to Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal Zone . They also included the elimination of all military bases in Latin America . The amendments “evidently” covered Guantánamo .
 Roa instructed Lechuga to use “genteel and explanatory arguments and language” when informing Brazil . The tone could not disguise the signiªcance of the Cuban reservations .
 The day before Kennedy wrote to Khrushchev endorsing the Brazilian plan, Roa presented the fatal amendments to Bastian Pinto . Kennedy wrote the day before he proposed the plan .
 Despite “extending s goodwill” to the denuclearization concept, he listed all the revisions demanded by Cuba, essentially rendering the proposal a dead letter . Despite "extending goodwill," he listed the revisions, he said the proposal was essentially dead .
 Bastian Pinto found it difªcult to comprehend why Castro repeatedly, if politely, spurned Brazil’s appeals and suggestions . Pinto: ‘It's dif’�t hard to understand why Castro spurned us’
 Kennedy-Khrushchev Exchanges (Washington: Government Printing Of Ofªce, 1996), 215. JFK-Krushchev, Nikyushchev and LBJ exchanged exchanges .
 For the text of the Brazilian proposal (a revision of a text originally submitted in September), see Draft UN Resolution A/C.1/L.312 .
 Quotations from this and all other Cuban documents, unless otherwise noted, are the present author’s unofªcial translations from the original Spanish . The author of this article has published a number of quotes from Cuban documents .
 Khrushchev had been receiving daily reports from Ambassador Alekseev in Havana . He made no mention of the idea when responding to Kennedy on 20 November .
 Roa sent a cable to Lechuga at the UN instructing him to coordinate with the Soviet delegation regarding the Brazilian proposal . That same day, Roa wrote a cable . Roa said that the proposal would be discussed in a meeting at the United Nations .
 The foreign minister says Lechuga must “insist with Arinos on the inclusion of our points of view,” including the amendments that were unacceptable to Washington .
 He saw the concept of a denuclearized Latin America as a means to ensure against a repetition of the missile crisis . The concept was created in the 1950s and 1960s .
 Mikoyan visited Washington in November on his way back to Moscow from Cuba . Rusk prodded him to reconsider the idea of carrying out the mission .
 reference to tactical nuclear weapons is blacked out in the facsimile of the Cuban document . The reference to the tactical nuclear weapon is also blacked-out .
 Cubans provided a copy to the Soviet delegation, which immediately transmitted it to Moscow . However, the Cubans did not provide a copy of the document .
 A Russian translation of the document was among the items contributed by Sergo Mikoyan for scholarly use at the October 2002 missile crisis conference in Havana . The document was translated for scholarly purposes at the conference in October 2002 .
 My thanks to Svetlana Savranskaya for locating and translating the document .
 This decision scuttled the proposal, and the Soviet Union and its East European allies quickly followed suit . This decision was the first in the world to reject the proposal .
 U.S. ofªcials similarly informed the Brazilians that they, too, would have to abstain given Havana’s refusal to go along . Havana refused to back the move .
 Brazil formally withdrew the resolution in mid-December without a vote, although Washington blamed Havana, not Rio de Janeiro, for its demise . Reluctantly, Brazil formally withdraws the resolution, but Washington blames Havana .
 By the time the denuclearization proposal was retracted, U.S.-Brazilian ties had deteriorated sharply compared to the brief high point during the missile crisis .
 Kennedy administration began to consider supporting a military coup, especially after a series of alarming cables from Gordon sparked concern that Goulart was .irting with an economic, political, and even military coup .
 The crisis reduced Kennedy’s obsession with the island and increased the importance of relations with Brazil, Weis writes .
 On 11 December, the Excomm reviewed policy toward Brazil and decided “to seek to change the political and economic orientation” of Goulart’s government . The Excomm was originally formed to handle the missile crisis .
 The president had relied on Robert Kennedy many times over the past two years when sensitive questions arose about Cuba . The president's answer to questions arose during the Cuban missile crisis .
 After hurriedly making arrangements, the younger Kennedy ew to Brasília and met Goulart at the Palacio de la Alvorada .
 The three-hour conversation merely reinforced the United States administration’s growing belief in the futility of collaborating with Goulart . The U.S. administration believes it will continue to work with the Russian president .
 Robert Kennedy came away convinced that Goulart was a “Brazilian Jimmy Hoffa” who would hand Brazil over to Communism unless stopped . Robert Kennedy was convinced that he was the ‘Jimmy Hoffa,’ according to Robert Kennedy .
 Brazil’s various attempts to pursue an “independent” foreign policy were not the only reason for the growing antagonism between Washington and Rio de Janeiro . U.S. ofªcials soon came to believe that Goulart was espousing a form of neutral
 When Brazil tested the limits of U.S. tolerance, the Kennedy administration became increasingly worried about a country that it considered a vital ally in its own sphere .
 As far back as late 1959 U.S. ofªcials concluded that it would be impossible to live with Fidel Castro’s regime . They were intent on getting rid of the Communist government in Cuba rather than reaching an accommodation . This was true .
 Eisenhower and his administration politely turned down Brazil’s repeated offers of mediation and “good ofªces” to help resolve the U.S.-Cuban dispute .
 Brazil’s attempt to devise a ‪rst year of the Kennedy administration in 1961 led nowhere . It remained so during the . . The . attempt to . devise a .Finlandization” neutrality formula for Cuba, its good-ofªces gambit alongside
 Rusk gave green light to Dantas to find out if Castro would be willing to split with Moscow in exchange for being welcomed back into the hemisphere’s good graces . Rusk was still inclined to seek Castro's ‘disposal’ afterward, even though he
 Only under profound duress, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, did the Kennedy administration genuinely embrace Brazil’s readiness to serve as a channel to Castro .
 The Albino mission to Havana at the height of the crisis constituted a minor mystery at the time . Albino missions to Havana are still a mystery now .
 Even within the U.S. government, some senior ofªcials were puzzled .
 The basic proposal unquestionably was implemented, but changes in the situation and Brazil's handling of the mission did mean that the message was not conveyed precisely as Washington had intended .
 The historiography of the Cuban missile crisis has been equally misleading in its references to Brazil . The history of the crisis has also been misleading in reference to Brazil, the author says .
 Ernest May and Philip Zelikow said in 1997 and 2001 that the United States plan on 27 October for Brazilian mediation was “overtaken by the events” of the 179.2 million people killed in the World War II .
 De martí a Fidel correctly notes the United States role behind the Albino Silva mission but erroneously dates the midnight conversation between Gordon and Hermes Lima to the night of Friday, 26 October .
 Goulart's handling of the matter, especially his decision to entrust the mission to Albino rather than Bastian Pinto, further darkened the Kennedy administration’s impression of the Brazilian president and his inconsistent behavior .
 Kennedy gave Fidel Castro the text of the message approved by Kennedy forty years earlier for transmittal to the Cuban leader on the evening of 27 October . Kennedy gave the text to Castro in Havana in October 2002 .
 Castro had not previously known about the intended communication . He recalled, “That day we were .ghting,” ªring at low-level United States reconnaissance .
 In the event, the Albino mission that reached Havana on 29 October, after Khrushchev had decided to remove the missiles, made no lasting impression on Castro . Castro had no idea that the sudden visit had actually been instigated by Washington .
 The odds seem remote that even if Castro had known of 183 deaths, the odds are remote that he would have known of the deaths of 183 people .
 The grounds simply did not exist for fruitful or even mutually respectful negotiations . Apparently, the grounds simply didn't exist on either side .
 Its attempt to mediate and its denuclearization proposal both came to naught . Castro’s hard line was in large measure because of his hard line . The U.S. and Cuba have been at odds for decades .
 In that respect, the crisis may have served to “educate GOB [Government of Brazil] through process of frustration,” as Gordon had anticipated .
 Brazilian diplomats claim the crisis vindicated their efforts to mediate the U.S.-Cuban confrontation before it reached a boiling point . On the other hand, Brazilian diplomats say it vindicates their longstanding efforts .
 This would explain Kennedy’s preference in 1963 to rely mostly on U.S. channels to communicate secretly and unofªcially with Havana . Kennedy was still pursuing covert operations, assassination plots, and serious contingency planning .
 Subsequent U.S. administrations engaged in similar direct contacts, even in the absence of normal diplomatic relations . Subsequent administrations engage in similar contacts .
 The contacts became even more frequent after the establishment of ‘interests sections’ in the Cuban and American capitals in the late 1970s .
 Even during periods of acute tension between Washington and Havana, a sporadic direct dialogue has been held behind the scenes .
 The acrimony between Washington and Havana at the time was too entrenched . It was too much of a war between the U.S. and Cuba in the 1950s .
 Castro represented the more militant and uncompromising party in that dispute . Despite the very real tension that erupted between Havana and Moscow in 1962, Castro represented a more militant party .
 The Cuban leader’s bellicosity hardly made it likely that he would have suddenly veered toward the ‘bourgeois” Latin American governments, not the U.S., not to mention the United States . The Cuban president's belliceness hardly makes it likely
 A conclusion requires additional research in U.S., Brazilian, and still-closed Cuban archives . A ªrm conclusion requires further research in the United States .
 This article, however, seeks to provide one piece of a murky history of secret U.S.-Cuban diplomacy during the Castro era .
 The article also is intended to highlight the link between the missile crisis and the quieter crisis in US-Brazilian ties . The article is meant to show the relationship between Washington and Brazil during the Cold War .
 I hope to provide fuller acknowledgments in a forthcoming book on the U.S.Brazilian-Cuban triangular relationship .
 The Brazilian archives in Brasília, Brazil, and the Norwegian archives in Washington, D.C. are located in Brazil . The archives include the Brazilian Foreign Ministry archives .
