 Cuban leader Raúl Castro’s announcement that Cubans will now be allowed to travel freely beyond their island is the latest reminder of the legacy of the 1962 US-Soviet standoff over nuclear missiles in Cuba .
 It may seem astonishing now, but throughout the 1950s and early ’60s, children like this writer throughout America, and most probably in the Soviet Union, lived with the idea of death .
 Death in the form of nuclear Armageddon would be visited on school children foolish enough to fail to follow the instructions in every school's routine ‘duck and cover’ civil defence drills .
 The rise and fall of a wailing civil defence siren would sound, children scrambled safely beneath their elementary school wooden desks, heads down, eyes covered to protect against the deadly atomic flash fearfully watching for the tell-tale flash .
 Television, radio, newspapers and popular novels frequently offered stories about the atomic holocaust visited upon Earth . Russian and American bombers, missiles and even nuclear-armed artillery duelled for victory .
 Shows like ‘The Twilight Zone’ dealt with the terrors of a post-nuclear war world . Dr Strangelove fantasized about the inevitable; while classic science fiction stories like On the Beach, A Canticle for Leibowitz and The Golden Horn set out the new
 Einstein said he wasn’t sure about the Third World War, he was absolutely certain the war that came after that one would use sticks, stones, bows and arrows . Einstein answered that while he wasn't sure about that war, the war came after .
 The U.S. defence bureaucracy and military establishment – and undoubtedly their Soviet equivalents – were equally transfixed with the emerging nuclear balance . The United States tried hard to create a military doctrine that could explain how one side’s nuclear weapons would be a counterweight to the other�
 Each side was intent on stockpiling sufficient weapons that even if its antagonist could carry off a pre-emptive launch of weapons, the other side would still have sufficient forces left over in reserve to deliver a lethal response .
 No rational leader would choose to launch a first strike if it meant their own half of the world became cinders once all the missiles and planes had done their horrible work . With that clarified, no rational leader .
 For the theorists, the idea was to create a perfectly protected second strike that could guarantee retaliation and thereby prevent the first strike from ever happening .
 Strategists like Herman Kahn and Thomas Schelling developed mathematically sophisticated models of the movement up the escalatory ladder from a modest border patrol clash to a full-scale nuclear war, the better to sort out how to put a break on any run-away military confrontation .
 The two sides continued to test increasingly terrifyingly sized nuclear weapons . Meanwhile, they worked on missile delivery systems of increasing accuracy and ease of operation .
 In 1960’s American presidential election, one of the issues that animated the campaign was the supposed missile gap favouring the Soviet Union . The missile gap was a key issue in the 1960s American election .
 Kennedy charged Eisenhower’s Republican administration allowed the Russians to achieve tactical, and perhaps even strategic, success as they built larger, more agile guided missiles in contrast to those developed by the American military . Democratic candidate John F Kennedy charged that Eisenhower's Republican administration had allowed the Russian to achieve
 This was paired with the Russians’ success in reaching space with their new rockets . The Russians have already reached space with new rockets.
 The fear was that a Russian satellite, loaded with a bomb, could pass over the U.S. and launch its payload from space . The fear is that a bomb could be launched from space from a satellite .
 Fidel Castro’s increasingly radical socialist revolution in Cuba was drawing closer to a full-scale alliance with Russia at the time, antagonising the Americans . Fidel Castro's increasingly radical socialism was being drawn closer to an alliance .
 Kennedy allowed the CIA to go forward in sending a secretly equipped army of Cuban exiles to end Castro’s rule on the island . Kennedy, perhaps unnerved by his unhappy first encounter with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, allowed the move forward .
 Castro was close to panic over the possibility of a formal United States invasion of his island . Castro prevailed upon his Soviet allies to build up their military forces on the island, including the installation of batteries of intermediate range nuclear missiles .
 These were missiles that could reach most of the territory of the continental US, most of its major cities, many of its primary nuclear weapons bases – all in less time than it would take to prepare to launch America’s own missiles and bombers .
 Russia's first-strike capability in the hands of the Russians seemed to be in place . Strategic surprise with an actual first strike capability in place seemed in place in Russia's hands .
 Castro's missile force has also become a shield that will prevent an American invasion, Castro says . Castro: "For Castro, this missile force is also a shield" for the U.S.
 For the Soviet Union this gamble seems poised to achieve strategic success, allowing them to force the Americans to make yet other concessions in Berlin, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean littoral – or else else .
 Missile emplacements discovered by routine surveillance flights over Cuba by U.S. spy planes . Then these new missile emplacement were discovered by . American spy planes. Then they discovered the new missiles .
 The president and his cabinet and staff were briefed by military and intelligence analysts . Once they were sure they were missiles, the president and Cabinet members were briefed .
 On 22 October, Kennedy went on live TV and radio to announce that terrible Russian missiles were in Cuba, with more on the way . Kennedy made the announcement on 22 October .
 America checked out bomb shelters and stocked up on supplies like tinned milk, beans, tuna, biscuits and water . America – almost literally – held its collective breath, then checked out bombs shelters . America is almost ready to go into a state of emergency .
 This might have meant a nuclear war a generation of children had spent afternoons under their school desks giggling about . But this might not have meant the nuclear war was actually a nuclear bomb .
 The president ordered troops to move south to Florida in the first steps of an actual invasion force . The president has ordered a troop deployment to Florida . The move is the first step toward a military invasion of Florida .
 The navy steamed a flotilla into place to tighten a ring around Cuba, quarantining the island . It was hoped to monitor the return to Russia of missiles already in place .
 It was called a quarantine, an antiseptic, clinical word, instead of a ‘blockade’, which could be interpreted as an act of war . Instead of a 'blockade' it could have been interpreted as a war act, it was called quarantine .
 The two sides were moving quickly into unknown territory, like night drills in a dense forest . "The two sides are moving quickly . like night . drills in the dense forest," says CNN iReporter .
 The wrong turn of phrase, the wrong message or the wrong act could go all wrong . The wrong signal, the right signal, and the wrong twitch and things could go wrong .
 The mythology evolved out of this confrontation is of steely eyed men in the White House who carefully calibrated quarantine ship placements and Russian transport ship inspections without boarding the enemy vessels . The mythology that evolved from this confrontation evolved from the confrontation .
 The craftily interpreted messages from Khrushchev to pick the one that gives a way forward out of madness . The craftly interpreted messages to pick one of the ones that gives way forward .
 U.S. will dismantle older missiles based in Turkey and Italy aimed at Russia . The move makes it easier to climb back down that ladder of escalation and away from nuclear disaster .
 Entire university courses are built around the crisis as a case study in political management . Entire universities courses are based on the crisis .
 Even now, conferences in honour of the crisis’ 50 anniversary, lectures and yet more books are coming forward . The crisis' 50 anniversary is being celebrated with conferences and lectures .
 The myth has become a touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured . But Cold War historian Michael Dobbs has recently argued that “the myth” has become “a touchstone’s toughness .”
 Dobbs has learned that the Russian ships did not continue ominously to steam towards the quarantine line in the Caribbean Sea . Dobbs learned that they did not actually continue to steam toward the quarantined line .
 Rather than this clash of the titans, the real dangers came from the more mundane fog of war . The real dangers were the rather mundane fog, says CNN's John Defterios .
 By 27 October, Dobbs argues, the two national leaders were no longer the total masters of their respective military machines . Dobbs says the two leaders were now sliding onward under their own momentum .
 The Soviets sent MiG fighters into the air to try to shoot down the American intruder . Alaska Air Defence Command scrambled F-102 interceptors armed with tactical nuclear missiles . The U.S. also scrambled F.102 interceptor missiles armed with nuclear warheads .
 In the Caribbean, a Soviet submarine commander was dissuaded by his subordinates from using his nuclear torpedo against American destroyers that were trying to force him to the surface, Dobbs writes .
 Dobbs said the lesson will need to be understood by whoever takes charge of the U.S. military forces on 20 January 2013 . Dobbs left unsaid by Dobbs, but just as clearly true, is that this same lesson .
