 The arms race was driven by the U.S. military-industrial complex, without the consent of the United States people . The U.N. has been involved in the arms race for more than a decade .
 "In the South, its the corrupt politicians that buy those arms not the people. Again, in the South," says CNN's John Sutter .
 This can be achieved by using chemical devices, i.e., imploding several small amounts into a small volume inside the bomb . This is done by imploding small amounts of explosives into a very small volume .
 Several subcritical amounts when fired into a small volume, exceed critcal mass and thus fissile material fissions with neutrons . Subcritical amounts can be fired into small volume and exceed critical mass .
 Each fission of either U-235 or Pu-235 nucleus induced by a neutron produces two radioactive fission products and on the average 2. neutrons with the evolution of a large amount of energy .
 It is an uncontrolled chain reaction and thus a fraction of fissile material is fissioned . Fissioned material is then released from the fissioning process .
 Fission products that are produced along with enormous amount of energy, disperse in the environment . Fissions products are produced in large amounts of energy and disperse into the environment.
 The second one consists of an atom bomb with deuterium and tritium compounds like lithium deuteride etc. The second atom bomb is a bomb made of hydrogen and helium . The first atom bomb was made of a hydrogen atom bomb .
 At these high temperatures deuterium and tritium start reacting with each other to form a helium atom and 14.6MeV neutron .
 As you see that it produces a stable atom of helium and a fast-moving neutron . As you can see that the atom is produced, it is produced by helium and the neutron .
 In addition to fission products we also have neutron-induced radioisotopes . In short, in addition to the fission product, they also have neutrinos .
 These are also dispersed along with enormous amount of energy in the environment . These are dispersing large amounts of energy into the environment, scientists say .
 This types of bomb has been tested by many nations in South Pacific and in Siberia from 1952 to 1963 . Many nations tested this type of bomb from 1952-1963 .
 The difference is that it is detonated at high altitudes so that neutrons can travel to ground level and destroy life . The difference between the detonation and detonation is that the bomb is detonated in a high-altitude location .
 Some neutrons react with other material and produce radioisotopes . Of course, some neutrons do react with each other and produce them .
 The fission bomb is kept as small as one can assemble and the amount of tritium and deuterium is kept large . The bomb was built in the 1940s and is believed to be one of the largest in the world .
 Once the fission bomb raises the temperature so as to initiate tritium-deuterium reaction, the fusion energy evolved in the D-T reaction keeps the temperature high for a longer duration and thus keeps the reaction going .
 Human life is destroyed by neutrons over a certain area under the bomb . Human life can be destroyed in certain areas of the bomb's impact .
 As the distance becomes longer between the spot where the bomb is detonated and the ground, neutron flux also reduces . 6-Mev neutrons fly to all directions .
 The ones that are directed toward the sky and not deflected, do not harm humans or cause property damage . They are directed to the sky . The ones are directed at the sky do not cause harm or damage to property .
 It is not as distructive as the hydrogen bomb but it is false notion that there is very little radioactivity associated with it . It's not as distructive as the hydrogen bomb but it's false notion there are very little radioactivity associated with

 I doubt if many people knew then or now how close we were to the tragedy . I doubt many people know now or now that many people were killed in the tragedy.
 As a direct principal I think I can give you some insights concerning the ""scramble"" of the F106 jets from Duluth Air Base . The F106 jet is one of the most powerful jets in the world .
 The Squadron under the command of Lt Col Kupersmith had 18 airplanes and about twenty four rated pilots . The Squadron had about 20 pilots .
 Hurley was a charismatic officer who was very popular with the pilots in the 11th Squadron . Hurley died in the Battle of the Atlantic at the end of the war .
 As a result the morale all over the base, and particularly in the Fighter Squadron, was very low . As a . result, the morale . over-the-base, and especially in the . Fighter Squadron was . very low, and as a result of the . low morale all
 Kupersmith ordered that all flyable aircraft be mated with a pilot . Four armed airplanes were kept on 5 minute alert status at all times at all .
 The 11th was a very close knit origination and the pilots wives were an integral part of the Squadron . The pilots' wives were also integral to the squadron .
 To improve moral they prepared a buffet diner and served it in our squadron Mess Hall to all the members of the squadron .
 Because I was closest to my airplane when the klaxon sounded, I was first to leave the my hanger and taxi toward the west end of the runway . Because of his position, he was the closest to his airplane when he heard the first whistle .
 Under the rules of engagement no further confirmation of the scramble was required . The three pilots in the planes behind me had every intention of taking off with armable nuclear weapons on board .
 About halfway down the taxiway, the order came by radio to abort the scramble . The order was followed by a radio call from a radio tower tower .
 The authentication required the use of a code book and a key that was valid for only a specific amount of time . The authentication was required for the authentication of a key .
 This procedure was not easy to do particularly at night, while taxiing, and wearing gloves . This procedure is not easy, and especially at night .
 When the order to abort was authenticated the four airplanes returned to the ramp and were re-fueled and re-set up on alert . The four airplanes were able to safely land safely in the air .
 Back inside the squadron mess hall there were some extremely white faces among the wives . The wives of the wives were also extremely white .
 "My own wife said she was sure we were at war the minute Klaxon sounded. My own wife thought we would be at war," he says . "I'm sure we're at war, but I'm not," he adds .
 I don't remember the names of the three pilots behind me on the taxiway . But I can give you a few names of pilots it could have been. I'm not sure who was behind me but it could've been the pilots .
 During the Cuban crisis we did get one airplane airborne with an armable nuclear weapon on board . We did get a plane airborne with a nuclear bomb on board during the crisis .
 This happened about two days into the crisis under circumstances I do not know. This happened two days after the crisis began . This happened in the early days of the crisis in Syria .
 The flight was a single ship and the pilot was Captain, General Winston Deporter . General Deporter was the pilot of the flight .

 "This occupied our minds completely. Once in the airplane we had the task of getting an expensive weapons system airborne," the author says .
 Two of the missiles were radar guided all the way to the target, and two were self guided heat seeking missiles . The missiles were guided by radar guided to their target .
 The MB1 nuclear weapon was probably the dumbest weapons system ever purchased . It was probably a dumbest weapon system ever bought .
 Prior to launch the airplane radar computed a lead collision course and the best range to fire the missile . The missile was launched by a U.S. Air Force Air Force missile .
 A lead collision course is the course of the missile that would put it under the target at a point in space slightly ahead of the position the target occupied at launch at launch . The missile would then try to find the target's position at the time of launch .
 The bomb was supposed to explode just under the bomber or group of bombers and bring them down by over-pressuring then with the atomic blast . The atomic blast was intended to bring down the bomber .
 The effect of that blast on the F106 that delivered the missile was never adequately ascertained . The effect on that blast was never properly determined .
 In the 1960s the percieved threat was from Russian Bear bombers coming over the pole at high altitude and then dropping to tree top level to deliver their weapons . The threat was thought to have been from a Russian Bear bomber .
 We trained for this but because it was so dangerous, particularly at night, we were restriced to an altitude no lower than 5000 feet above the terrain . The Russians were believed to have terrain mapping radar which hooked to their autopilots and allowed them to go much lower .
 LeMay bitterly criticised Kennedy for not allowing an invasion of Cuba . The blockade of Cuba worked, the crisis passed and LeMay criticised Kennedy's decision .
 President Kennedy invited the chiefs to the White House so that he could thank them for their support during the crisis . As Macnamara put it, 'there was one hell of a scene'
 At a conference in 1989 in Moscow in Moscow it was revealed C.I.A. 'intelligence' of only conventional capability in Cuba could not have been more wrong .
 The Cubans had 20 nuclear warheads for their R-12 ballistic missiles which could have reached Washington quite easily . The U.S. had 20 warheads for the missiles . The Cuban missiles were able to reach Washington easily .
 There were also 9 tactical nuclear missiles that Soviet commanders in Cuba were delegated power to use . The missiles were also used by Soviet leaders in Cuba .

 The revelation counters important aspects of the traditional history of the U.S. bomb project, known as the Manhattan Project . The revelation counters important aspects .
 The commonly accepted version of atomic bomb history states the bombs were created entirely by the United States . The United States spent $2 billion and five years of work by a battalion of top scientists, with help from Great Britain .
 Documentary evidence indicates time pressures, technological delays, and a surprise opportunity to obtain from Germany allowed the Manhattan Project to complete its bombs in time for the mid-August 1945 deadline .
 Nazi Germany was an important source of nuclear bomb components used in the attacks on Japan, Hydrick says . Hydrick displayed several documents from the United States National Archives and elsewhere to support his historical revision .
 The existence of U-234 and its cargo have long been known, and have been the subject of discussions over whether the uranium or any other components found on the vessel were used in the war against Japan . Until now, until now, no connection has ever been proved .
 At $100,000 per ounce in 1945 dollars, enriched uranium was well worth the investment in gold to protect it . Hydrick explained that, at $100k per ounce, the enriched uranium in uranium was worth well worth .
 Gold would not have been used to ship uranium that had not yet been enriched, sources say . The value of raw uranium did not justify such expense, the source says .
 He cites instances in the United States program when uranium that had not been enriched was shipped in cloth bags and steel drums with no protection from corrosion .
 A second, stronger, validation that the uranium on board U-234 was enriched uranium came from eye-witness accounts of a crew member of the submarine, who was present at both the loading and unloading of the boat .
 A crew member reported in two memoirs that the uranium containers had the label U235 painted on them just before they were lowered into the submarine . The uranium containers were painted with the label 'U235' before being lowered into a submarine .
 The supply tubes of the submarine were tested with geiger counters after it was turned over to the United States . Geiger counters registered a very high level of radioactivity . The same crew member reported that United States Navy personnel later tested the supply tubes .
 Without understanding the import of the U235 designation, the crew member assumed the uranium was left over from failed, but later highly publicized, plutonium breeding reactor experiments .
 Even if uranium was enriched, that does not prove it was used in the Manhattan Project, concedes Hydrick . Hydrick: "Even if the uranium was enriched, it doesn't prove that it was in use in the project"
 Documents show relationships between the Manhattan Project and the U.S. U-boat . To prove the two events were related, he presented copies of documents held in the United States National Archives .
 One of the documents is a secret cable from the Commander of Naval Operations directing that a three-man party had been dispatched to take possession of the cargo from U-234 .
 Major John E Vance of the Army Corps of Engineers was accompanying two Naval officers in an otherwise all-Navy operation . Vance was a major part of the Manhattan Project under the Army under which it operated .
 The uranium had disappeared from the materials in Navy possession . Additional documents show that a few days following Vance’s arrival, when another accounting of the cargo was made, the uranium disappeared .
 U-234 carried eight high-profile military and scientific passengers who were not crew members, says Hydrick . A second connection is also documented between the Manhattan Project and U.234, he says .
 The alleged Commander Alvarez appears to have been the personal handler of Dr. Dr. Alvarez . The alleged commander appears to be Dr. Alberto Alvarez's personal handler .
 Heinz Schlicke, one of the scientific passengers on board U-234, had now become a prisoner of war . Heinz was one of a number of scientific passengers aboard the U.234 .
 Schlicke was an expert on high frequency technology such as radar and infra-red technology . He was a pioneer in radar technology and infrared technology in the 1960s .
 No entry in the name of Alvarez was recorded in either document in 1943 and 1945 . Hydrick found no entry in Alvarez's name in any document .
 The researcher points to one of the heroes of the Manhattan Project, Luis W Alvarez, as the probable identity of Commander Alvarez, who he suggests was dressed incognito in Navy uniform to surreptitiously cull information and technological expertise from Dr. Dr.
 The Manhattan Project had struggled for a year and a half with the dilemma . Hydrick says the Manhattan Project struggled with the problem for years .
 Alvarez was head of a three-man committee tasked with solving the fusing problem . Hydrick points to documentation from the National Archives showing that Alvarez was the head of the committee .
 Schlicke had in his personal care while on the U-boat, a supply of Germany’s newly developed infra-red fuses,’ Hydrick said . Hydrick continued: ‘Schlicke’ was in care of Germanys newly
 The evidence strongly suggests, in my view, that Luis Alvarez and Commander Alvarez were one and the same person . Luis Alvarez used Dr. Dr. Luis Alvarez as a doctor, Dr. Alvarez says . The evidence suggests that the two men were one of the same .
 Schlicke’s infra-red fuses ignite all 32 detonation points on the American plutonium bomb simultaneously at the speed of light, solving the plutonium bomb detonation problem . The fuses were fuses to ignite all of the 32 detonations points at the time of
 Hydrick’s revelations will probably cause widespread controversy among historians and World War Two enthusiasts . His proposition that U-234 was intentionally surrendered to United States forces according to a prearranged agreement with top Nazi leaders is certain to bring a storm of debate .
 There is a body of circumstantial evidence suggesting some of Hitler�s top men made a deal with our leading intelligence and military people to hand over the U-boat in return for their freedom and protection .
 Historians have long argued the claim that Bormann died trying to escape from Berlin on May 1, 1945 . Historians say the claim is true .
 The main evidence given for his death was based on eye-witness accounts by Hitler�s chauffeur and Artur Axmann, head of the Hitler Youth organization . Both maintained strong Nazi convictions and connections until their deaths .
 Neither witness categorically stated they were certain they saw Bormann dead, their account has become the traditional version of the end . Neither witness said they saw him dead, but it has become a traditional version .
 Despite this finding, Bormann was convicted of war crimes in absentia at the Nuremberg trials . A warrant was placed for his arrest that remained in effect for many years, as did a later warrant issued in West Germany in 1967* based on new evidence of his continued survival
 Many sightings of Bormann, alive and well, were reported over the three decades following the war . Many sightings were reported in the years following the conflict .
 The supposed grave of Bormann’s escape partner, Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller, was also disinterred in 1963 and found to contain the skeletal remains of three men, none of them Mueller . The graves of the Gestapo chief were also found in 1963 to contain
 The subway had been flooded by the SS, which, by the way, killed thousands of German women and children who were forced there for shelter when their homes were bombed out . Its fairly certain they escaped together, but the problem with the rest of the story is .

 Stalin's agents traced Bormann to Hamburg, where he boarded a large U-boat and departed Germany . From there, Stalin insisted, his agents traced him to Hamburg . Stalin insisted that he boarded the U-boats and left Germany .
 Martin Bormann maintained secret radio negotiations with Admiral Karl Doenitz, the commander of all of Germany�s U-boats, and had made plans to escape . Martin had planned to escape to Admiral Doenitzer’s submarine headquarters .
 Doenitz at first resisted this effort but ultimately was ordered by Hitler (presumably at Bormann's bidding) to accept the Nazi leader at his headquarters . Hitler ordered the Nazi Party to meet with the German leader at Hitler's headquarters .
 Hydrick concedes, details become sketchy and many disparate accounts are given of Bormann's escape or possible end . From this point on, Hydrick admits, details of the escape or end are sketchy . Hydrick conceded, "Many disparate accounts" given .
 Fuehrer bunker escape stories seem to indicate a probable scenario, researcher says . But parallels from various, otherwise unconnected, unconnected stories indicate a possible scenario, he says .
 Hanna Reitsch flew seriously injured German Air Force General Ritter von Greim out of Berlin late one night in the last days of the war . Reitsch was Hitler's good friend and the counterpart to Amelia Earhart .
 Other accounts confirm the flight was made April 29, 1945, the same night Stalin�s agents reported Bormann�s escape by small aircraft . Other accounts say it was made that night .
 Reitsch recounts how they flew to Doenitz’s headquarters before flying south to the Austrian/Swiss border . General von Greim was badly injured and very important . Reitsch recalls how they made an odd and seemingly careless detour .
 Second, independent account purportedly of Gestapo Chief Heinrich Mueller’s escape follows a somewhat similar path, though in it he was flown out of Berlin alone .
 In this account, Mueller was flown out of the German capital late the same night as in Reitschs tale, in a Fieseler Storch airplane, in the same aircraft used in the story . Mueller's story is told in this account .
 Mueller makes no account of flying to meet Doenitz, but tells a story about flying to the Austrian/Swiss border that is decidedly similar to Reitschs version .
 There are obviously discrepencies in these stories, as there are in virtually all accounts of these events, according to Hydrick . Hydrick says it is hard to know what is true and what is disinformation .
 Three men, one injured, and a woman, flying out of Berlin in a small airplane, seem to paint a compelling scenario . But the similarities of the independent accounts set against the observations of Stalin�s informants seem to be compelling . The similarities of independent accounts appear to paint
 It identifies Bormann and Mueller by name; also a heavily bandaged man, which fits the description of von Greim at the time . Hanna Reitsch, probably the only woman in the world one could have expected to see in that circumstance, at that time . At that time
 Hydrick: 'The three accounts just seem to interlock too well not to be connected,’ insists Hydrick . Hydrick says the accounts 'just seem to interlock too well' to be connected .
 The chief radio operator of U-234 received at least one message on a high-priority frequency directly from Hitler's bunker in Berlin . The U-boat was stationed in Kristiansand, Norway, when it was stationed there .
 Admiral Doenitz seems to be an effort to keep the U-boat under his command . An order sent to the U.boat a short time later was sent to keep it under .
 If the boat was following the course its captain and traditional history said it took headed for Japan, then it was travelling at only 1 1 1/2 miles per hour . The boat is believed to have been travelling at just 1 1-2 mph .
 Hydrick contends that U-234 silently patrolled the North Sea according to prearranged plans with Bormann at Hitler�s headquarters . Hydrick: U.234 was able to negotiate an agreement with Doenitz, until he negotiated agreement with Hitler .
 As the end of the war drew near, the boat slid into Hamburg harbor under cover of night and picked up Martin Bormann and Heinrich Mueller . The boat continued its voyage, by way of a rendevouz off the coast of Spain to off-load Borm Mann
 Hydrick asserts that a successful negotiation between Bormann and Doenitz would explain the radio transmissions . Hydrick says it would explain why Doenitzer, with no political experience and virtually no political following, became Hitlers successor .
 He believes a series of enigmatic events leading up to U-234’s surrender point to an intentional secret capitulation of the boat outside of the parameters of the general surrender orders given on VE Day .
 He contends a photo taken by a local newpaper photographer at the time U-234 docked on U.S. shores, shows a mysterious, unidentified civilian prisoner with a remarkable physical resemblance to Heinrich Mueller .
 Hydrick believes the subject of the photo is, in fact, the former head of the Gestapo stepping onto American soil . Hydrick says the photo shows the former Gestapo chief stepping onto U.S. soil .
 According to Hydrick, Mueller oversaw the transferral of the atomic bomb components and other war materials from Germany to the United States . In return, Mueller, Bormann and many other Nazis received American protection for decades .
 He is also completing a manuscript for a book he hopes to publish later this year .
 Hydrick has spent his vacation time the last three years, as well as significant amounts of his free time for eight years and about $20,000 of his own money, doing research for a book . Hydrick said he questions the foundations of the traditional history of the atomic bomb and
 Hydrick said he feels confident enough in his evidence to come forward with the information . Hydrick has written 10 of the book's 15 chapters complete . He says he's confident enough to share his evidence .
 The commonly accepted version of atomic bomb history states the bombs were created during the Manhattan Project . The most commonly accepted history of the atomic bombs is that they were created in the 1940s .
 Hydrick said a ""surprise opportunity"" to obtain essential components and data from Germany allowed the United States to complete the uranium and plutonium bombs in time to drop them in August 1945 .
 In May, 1945, a huge Nazi U-boat was headed for Japan but surrendered to the U.S. Navy . The U.N. Navy took control of the vessel in May 1945 . In May 1945, it was headed to Japan, but surrendered .
 The submarine, called U-234, was three times the size of a normal U-boat . It was called three times larger than a normal German submarine .
 Hydrick says he has evidence that the contents of the submarine were transferred to the Manhattan Project to complete the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Hydrick said he believes he believes, and has evidence, that the submarine was used to carry out the bomb .
 The surrender of U-234 appears to have been prearranged by the U.S. military and Adolf Hitler's top lieutenant Martin Bormann, Hydrick says . Hydrick said the surrender appears to be a prearrarranged between the United States and Hitler's lieutenant Martin
 Hydrick says uranium on board the submarine was enriched uranium, which is usable in the creation of the uranium atomic bomb . Hydrick said he is the first to prove that enriched uranium was used in a nuclear bomb .
 Hydrick says captured enriched uranium was used in the uranium bomb which was used on Hiroshima Aug., 1945 . Hydrick said he has evidence that indicates the captured enriched . uranium was also used in Hiroshima Aug. 1945 .
 The U-234 also held infrared fuses such as the type needed for detonation of the plutonium bomb used against Japan, Hydrick says . Hydrick: The U.234 also had infrared sensors such as those needed to detonate the bomb used in Japan .
 Eight high-profile military and scientific passengers occupied the boat, including Germany's expert, Dr. Dr. Hans-Joachim Schauchner . Dr. Schauckner was the ship's first passenger .
 Luis Alvarez was the Manhattan Project's scientist who came up with the solution to simultaneously detonating 32 fuses needed to explode the plutonium bomb . Alvarez was credited with coming up with, at the last minute, the solution .
 The Manhattan Project had struggled for 1 1/2 years to find a way to detonate the fuses . Before the solution was found, the Manhattan Project spent 1 1-2 years trying to find out how to do it .
 Hydrick said he has evidence suggesting that the U-boat's technology was used by the Manhattan Project to complete the plutonium bomb which was dropped on Nagasaki Aug., 1945 . Hydrick: Evidence suggests that the technology as well as information from Schlicke were used .
 Hydrick said he has extensive evidence supporting his claims . Hydrick says he needs a 15-chapter book to explain it all . Hydricks says he has a lot of evidence to support his claim .
 Hydrick now resides in Houston and works in marketing communications for the Compaq Computer Corporation . He now works in Houston .
 Hydrick said he has spent time researching at the National Archives and Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., as well as the regional archives in Atlanta . Hydrick says he has also spent time at archives in Washington and Atlanta .
 In July, he was able to spend 10 days visiting family members still living in the Lake Tahoe area .
 Hydrick said he has not let his research get in the way of the rest of his life . Hydrick says he is proud of his work in the field of medicine .
 Hydrick said he will be happy that his efforts have paid off if the new information finds its way into the accepted history of the atomic bomb . Hydrick: "I'm not happy that my efforts paid off"
 The security of the test personnel and of nearby inhabitants has been assured . The security has been ensured by the test team .
 Those participating in the tests have fulfilled the task of our Motherland, says President Vladimir Putin . The tests have been carried out, says Putin .
 In Moscow, the 22nd Congress of the CPSU has already been in session for two weeks . The 22nd CPSU Congress of Russia has already begun in session .
 The Kremlin Palace of Congresses began its work in the newly-built Kremlin Palace . It was just opened its doors for the first time .
 50megaton explosion over Novaya Zemlya island in northern Russia above the Arctic Circle at an altitude of 4,000 meters . 50 megaton explosion .
 The atmospheric disturbance generated by the explosion orbited the earth three times . The explosion created an atmospheric disturbance that orbited Earth three times.
 The flash of light was so bright that it was visible at a distance of 1,000 kilometers, despite cloudy skies . Flash of light so bright it could be seen at a long distance from the light of the sun .
 The bomb exploded after having fallen slowly from a height of 10,500 meters, suspended by a large parachute . It exploded after falling slowly from 10,000 meters . The explosion was the first of its kind in a series of explosions in the air .
 By that time the crew of the TU-95 Bear bomber, commanded by Major Andrei Durnovtsev, were already in the safe zone some 45 km from the target .
 The commander was returning to earth as a lieutenant colonel and Hero of the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union Hero was a Soviet hero . He was killed in the Battle of the Caucasus .
 Efim Slavsky and Kirill Moskalenko, as deputies to the Congress, had arrived by plane on the day of the test to observe the explosion . The explosion was the first of a series of nuclear weapons tests in Russia .
 In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero, wooden houses were destroyed, and stone ones lost their roofs, windows and doors . Radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour after the disaster .
 At the time of the blast, the bombs designers and test supervisors were at the airfield near Olenya station on the Kola Peninsula . Major General Nikolai Pavlov, the Chairman of the State Commission, was at the time .
 For 40 minutes they had no firm information on the test, or the fate of the bomber and the Tu-16 Badger airborne laboratory accompanying it . The test took place in a test room in Moscow, Russia's capital .
 Only when radio contact with Novaya Zemlya was reestablished were they able to request information on the altitude of the cloud . Only when they were able to reestablish contact with the Russian city was able to ask for information .
 Both aircraft and documentary crews observing the test were subjected to a most graphic experience .
 The sea of light spread under the hatch and even clouds began to glow and became transparent . Even clouds also glow and become transparent .
 At that moment, our aircraft emerged from between two cloud layers and down below in the gap a huge bright orange ball was emerging . Down below, the aircraft was emerging from a gap in the clouds .
 Everything in this area has been swept clean, scoured, melted and blown away . "Everything has been blown away," says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Its hard to believe that a more powerful explosion will ever take place, says CNN.com's John Sutter . The explosion will be the most powerful ever, he says .
 The test stunned the world community, and became the subject of numerous discussions, legends, and myths which continue to this day . The test has been a major topic of discussion, legends and myths since it was created .
 Khrushchev agreed to sign the Moscow Limited Test Ban Treaty two years later with a 60 megatonner in the arsenal . The super-powerful hydrogen bomb represented a qualitative leap which wiped out the American advantage in total number of tests,
 The only way to compensate for this was to increase the power of the warhead, the U.S. says . "The only way" to compensate is to increase its power, he says .
 The explosion of the 50-MT bomb did not lead, as some suppose, to the immediate conclusion of the Limited Test Ban Treaty . The explosion was not an immediate end to the limited test ban .
 The explosion may have indirectly contributed to the talks success . However, one may speculate that the explosion indirectly helped the talks .
 It was a one-time demonstration of force, part of the superpower game of mutual intimidation . The U.S. has been involved in the world's most powerful and most powerful .
 The proposition that now we have even more powerful warheads is simply ridiculous . Superweapons are rejected by contemporary military doctrine, and the proposition is absurd . The proposition is simply absurd .
 Khrushchev's visit to the U.S. in September 1959 aggravated relations between Moscow and Washington . The following May the espionage flight of Frances Gary Powers over the Soviet Union aggravated them seriously .
 The U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft batteries near Sverdlovsk on 1 May 1960 . The aircraft was a reconnaissance aircraft .
 The summit conference of Soviet, U.S., British, and French state leaders in Paris was aborted . The return visit to the USSR of United States president Dwight Eisenhower was cancelled . In the aftermath, the summit conference was aborted and Eisenhower's return to the Soviet Union was cancelled.
 The failure of the U.S.-sponsored invasion by anti-Castro Cuban emigres at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 was a great shock for the Kennedy Administration . Cuba, where Castro came to power, became the object of passions, and the failure of a U.
 The main arena of opposition between the U.S. and Soviet Union was Europe . Europe was the main arena between the two countries .
 The serious, seemingly insoluble question of a peaceful German settlement once again rose to the fore, with the status of West Berlin the focus of attention . The serious question of the peace in Germany again came to the forefront .
 The exhausting talks on arms reduction, accompanied by strict demands from the Western Powers to inspect the territories of participating parties, were unsuccessful . Western Powers demanded inspection of the territories, but the talks failed .
 Geneva negotiations on a nuclear test ban looked more and more gloomy . The Geneva talks looked gloomy although the nuclear powers were adhering to a voluntary test moratorium .
 Hostile propaganda and recriminations between the USSR and the USA became the norm . Meanwhile, hostile propaganda was the norm between the two countries .
 Main event of that period was the erection of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 . Main event aroused a storm of protests in the West .
 It was the first to test an intercontinental ballistic missile and launch satellites into orbit . The first to send a man into outer space, it was also first to launch a man in outer space .
 The USSR did not yield to the Western pressure and started active operations on its own . Having acquired immense prestige, among the Third World countries, the USSR did . The USSR had acquired . immense prestige among the . Third . World countries in particular .
 By the end of the summer of 1961 international tensions grew unusually high, the course of events took on the peculiar logic of superpower politics . Therefore, when by the end . of the . summer of . 1961, international tensions were unusually high .
 For a month and a half prior to the announcement by the Soviet government, we, the developers of nuclear weapons, began preparing to test new prototypes . The Soviet government began testing new prototypes a month before the announcement .
 The U.S. gave the world ample warning about the upcoming event, it gave it ample warning . It also made public the power of the bomb under development, it said .
 By October 24, the final report, including the proposed design of the bomb and the theoretical and design calculations, was complete . The final report was released October 24 .
 The specifications in the report were sent to design engineers and bomb assemblers . The report was sent to designers and bomb makers .
 Report was co-authored by Andrei Sakharov, Victor Adamsky, Yuri Babaev, Yuri Smirnov, and Yuri Trutnev . The report was published by the Russian Investigative Committee .
 The parachute system to permit the slow descent of the bomb, which weighed more than 20 tons, was unique . It was unique to have a parachute system that allowed the bomb to slow descent .
 Bomb contained a special mechanism which triggered its detonation only after the plane had reached a safe distance . However, even if this parachute system had failed during the test, the bombers crew would not have been endangered, as the bomb’s .
 Tu-95 strategic bomber which was to carry the bomb to its target underwent unusual modification . Bomb was to be carried out by a Russian bomber carrying a bomb to a target .
 The bomb, around eight meters long and two meters wide, was too large to fit in the plane�s bomb bay . A non-essential part of the fuselage was cut away, and a special lifting mechanism attached, as was a device for fastening the bomb .
 The bomb was so huge that over half of it protruded from the plane during the flight . Over half of the bomb was seen protruding from the aircraft .
 The planes fuselage, and even its propeller blades, were covered with special white paint for protection from the explosion’s intense flash . The fuselage was covered in white paint to protect from the flash of the explosion .
 A separate airborne laboratory plane was also covered with the same paint . The same plane was covered in the paint .
 In Arzamas-16, the secret nuclear weapons laboratory in the Urals, the bomb was assembled in a factory-shop on a special railroad flatcar . After completion was camouflaged as a regular freight-train car .
 "It was necessary to build a railroad line right into the assembly-shop. It was necessary, it was necessary ... to build the railroad line," says the author of the book .
 I want to say that our tests of new nuclear weapons are also coming along very well, says President Barack Obama . Obama says the tests are coming along 'very well'
 "We shall shortly complete these tests presumably at the end of October," says the author .
 In exploding the 50megaton bomb we are testing the device for triggering a 100 megaton bomb . However, in exploding the . 50 megaton bombs we are tested for triggering 100megaton bombs . The bomb is a 50 megataton bomb bomb .
 In strengthening the defense of the Soviet Union, we are acting not only in our own interests but in the interests of all peaceloving peoples, of all mankind, says President Vladimir Putin . Putin: We are acting in the interest of all peace loving peoples .
 When the enemies of peace threaten us with force they must be countered with force, too . When the enemy of peace threatens us, we must be and will be countered . We need to be more impressive, too, and more impressive .
 Anyone who is still unable to understand this today will certainly understand it tomorrow, says President Obama . Obama will be able to make a speech at the White House on Thursday .
 This test demonstrated the global nature of the effects of a powerful nuclear explosion on the Earths atmosphere . This test was the first of its kind .
 The test of the bomb�s design confirmed the possibility of making a device of any power, however large . The test confirmed that the device could be made of any material, however, .
 For Sakharov, his involvement in the development of the 1961 superbomb marked a turning point in his years of work in thermonuclear weapons . For more information on the 1962 superbomb, visit http://www.nasa.org/sakharov .
 "This was the last device on which he worked intensely, seriously, and without hesitation," he said . "This is the last thing he has done without hesitation"
 He accepted the proposal to make and test this awesomely powerful bomb, motivated by a desire to demonstrate the absolute destructiveness and inhumanity of this weapon of mass annihilation, he said .
 No matter how sophisticated an opponent, the other side would find a simple, but crippling, response . The other side of the debate would find it easy to find a way to respond .
 The device at the same time demonstrated the technological potentials available to humanity .
 Sakharov searched for a worthy application for it, and he applied for it . Sakharova's application was submitted to the highest bidder in the world .
 He suggested using superpowerful explosions to prevent earthquakes . He also suggested using particle accelerators of unprecedented energy to probe the secrets of matter .
 He also advanced a plan to use similar explosions to deflect the course of heavenly bodies near earth, such as comets or asteroids .
 He was still preoccupied with the search for possible military applications of nuclear energy . But also, he was still looking at the possibility of possible military uses of nuclear power .
 Ninety-seven percent of the power of the 50-MT bomb derived from thermonuclear fusion . The bomb was remarkably clean and released a minimum of fission by-products which would elevate background radiation .
 U.S. scientists also wanted to reduce to a minimum the radioactive after-effects of nuclear testing, as well as lessen the effect of radiation on present and future generations . Thanks to this, our United States colleagues understood that .
 The enormous yield of the test (the most powerful of all tests conducted either by us or the USA) should have provoked and in fact did provoke fear throughout the world, in the sense that nuclear weapons were seen to threaten humanity's future .
 It also led to the realization that such weapons should be placed under international control . The framework for the framework for such weapons has yet to be found but must be sought out and implemented .
 A series of agreements limiting the testing and spread of nuclear weapons was gradually concluded . The agreements were gradually concluded in the 1950s .
 The world community and superpowers governments came to see the necessity for such agreements as a result of evaluating the results of many nuclear tests . The test of 30 October 1961 was the first nuclear test of its kind in North Korea .
 Sakharov sent a letter to Khrushchev opposing his decision to resume nuclear tests, suggesting that they would jeopardize the test ban negotiations, the cause of disarmament, and world peace . But also said he worked on the test of the 'Big Bomb' only after Khrush
 Viktor Adamsky worked on the Soviet nuclear weapons program in Sakharov’s group at Arzamas-16, the long-secret nuclear laboratory . Adamsky was a member of the group that worked at the secret laboratory .
