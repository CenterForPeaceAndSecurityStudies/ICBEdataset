 The study of international politics has evolved in reference to the great power wars, with every major conflict marked as a turning point in global history .
 The crises that trigger these wars are rigorously scrutinised for every single bit of a clue that may potentially shed light on the origins of such devastating undertakings . Consequently, the crises which trigger these crises are scrutinised .
 The 'other' crises that do not lead to wars are treated as relatively unimportant incidents that don't require the full brunt of our attention . The ‘other’ crises that don’t lead to war are often treated as ‘unimportant’ incidents .
 The crisis has shaped how we have come to think about nuclear weapons and foreign policy analysis in the last half a century . The focal point of numerous scholarly and journalistic inquiries, the crisis is now a focal point .
 During the so-called ‘thirteen days’ of October 1962, the world literally stared into the eyes of a nuclear abyss, only to step back in the last moment . The 'thirteen-day' stand-off took place in October 1962 .
 The contribution that a single study can make to our understanding of the crisis has become rather limited, if not marginal . However, these studies also suggest that after five decades, the contribution . can be made to the understanding of . the crisis, they say .
 Stern was a historian at the John F Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts from 1977 to 2000 . Stern was the first non-member of the ExComm, the President's famous inner circle, to analyse the tapes .
 Each empirical chapter deals with the myths surrounding a key member of the ExComm . The book unfolds systematically; each empirical chapter focuses on a key character .
 Robert Kennedy was ‘one of the most hawkish members’ of ExComm . He also championed the full-scale invasion of Cuba before the decision to opt for a blockade was reached . Kennedy opposed removal of Jupiter missiles from Turkey .
 Stern challenges the myth of Robert McNamara, who is usually depicted as the wise and cool-headed statesman who went out of his way to help John F Kennedy prevent a nuclear war . Stern challenges myth of McNamara .
 The tapes reveal McNamara's erratic posture was a far cry from his cool-headed image, Stern says . Stern: McNamara belonged with the hawks of ExComm .
 Stern’s book has a lot to offer to those who are not familiar with Stern's previous research, but it will not surprise those familiar with it . The book is published by Simon J. Stern at the University of New York University .
 Gibson examines ‘the role of talk’ among the ExComm members during the crisis . Gibson examines the role of ‘talk’ in the wake of the crisis.
 The conventional interpretations of ExComm members are misleading, Gibson argues . Gibson argues that the divergent preferences, interests, and beliefs among ExComm are misleading .
 Such machineries do not automatically lead to particular outcomes, but they can have ‘tremendous, even decisive, importance’ for them . ‘Even decisive, even when there is no guaranteed outcome,’ he said . Such machinations do not always lead to
 Qualitative analysis is coupled with quantitative inquiry about ‘who spoke, how they obtained the floor, and who was addressed’ , as well as how frequently an ExComm member spoke or was addressed . ExComm members are asked to explain how frequently they spoke .
 Gibson examines the ExComm debates with respect to three major turning points . Gibson examines three key turning points in the history of ExComm . Gibson: "ExComm" debates were a major turning point in history .
 The second major decision involved not stopping some Eastern bloc ships after the blockade was declared . The decision to not stop ships was made in response to the blockade .
 The third episode relates to Kennedy’s intricate ‘strategy’ to accept Khrushchev’�s milder – and first – proposal on October 27 . Kennedy also made a backstage concession over Jupiter missiles in Turkey .
 The book presents many aims and ideas, which, when combined with the book’s admittedly ‘highly inductive’ nature, sometimes prove to be overwhelming and distracting . However, the book presents a lot of ideas, and sometimes proves to be distracting .
 Paradoxically, while there is an abundance of ideas in the book, the only big idea seems to be that ‘talk’ really matters. Paradoxically the book is about how important 'talk' really matters .
 Some sections of Talk at the Brink may be impenetrable . Readers may not be familiar with the intricacies of the relevant debates in sociology over theory and methodology . Also, readers may not appreciate the novelty of its arguments .
 Stern, Barrett and Holland argue that the strategic myth-making efforts of the Kennedy administration in the aftermath of the crisis led to a particular narrative that is misleading . Similar to Stern and Barrett, they argue that Kennedy administration's efforts in aftermath of crisis were to create a narrative that was misleading
 By focusing on how the Kennedy administration managed the crisis, we tend to lose perspective on how their mismanagement prior to October 14th paved the way for the crisis . The Kennedy administration put the U.S. in a remarkably disadvantageous position at the bargaining table .
 Kennedy administration gets the blame for turning a blind eye to Cuba for five weeks between early September and mid-October . The Kennedy administration, in this narrative, turns the blame on the Kennedy administration .
 Key members of the Kennedy administration went to great lengths to cover the blunder . Barrett and Holland carefully document how they eventually succeeded . They build on rarely scrutinised reports (for example, papers of US Congress)
 The administration might have indirectly implied to the intelligence community that it preferred to limit the risk of inciting a geopolitical crisis over Cuba, but it never turned down a request for U2 surveillance missions during the photo gap .
 The authors all too readily assume that the Kennedy administration made a serious mistake . Second, they all too easily assume that it was a mistake, they say .
 It remains unclear how the crisis would have played out if the missiles had been discovered earlier . Furthermore, it remains unclear what would have happened if they had been found earlier .
 Blind Over Cuba raises important questions, but some readers may protest that its reading of the Kennedy administration’s conduct, at times, becomes slightly overcritical . The book is published by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tom Charity .
 Anastas Mikoyan was a historian of the Soviet Union and the son of a prominent Soviet statesman . He was the first senior Soviet official to visit Cuba after Fidel Castro took power, and the Soviet envoy to Cuba following the much-popularised thirteen days .
 Sergo Mikoyan's account mixes his own personal recollections (he accompanied his father during his visits to Cuba in 1960 and 1962) with a wide variety of documents from the Soviet archives .
 Sergo Mikoyan passed away in 2010 and the final manuscript was edited by Svetlana Savranskaya . Sergo died in 2010 at the age of 92 .
 Cuba was an important actor in the crisis, which itself was not ‘solved’ until the Soviet leadership and Castro came to an understanding about how to deal with the Soviet presence in the country, especially over the questions of the Soviet Il-28 bombers and the possibility of a
 Khrushchev ignored Cuban opinions and interests during the so-called October crisis . Just like the Kennedy administration, he ignored Cuban opinion and interests in the fall .
 Anastas Mikoyan spent three weeks in November 1962 in Cuba . The tensions between the Soviet Union and Cuba were finally alleviated thanks to diplomacy .
 Operation Anadyr aimed to secretly install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba . The book offers a great many insights into the so-called Operation AnAdyr that aimed to covertly install nuclear missiles .
 It was neither the ‘missile gap’ nor feelings of strategic inferiority that prompted the operation . The Soviets were genuinely trying to prevent a United States invasion of Cuba, author says .
 Some readers may raise issues about the author’s treatment of Anastas Mikoyan . However, some readers may also raise issues .
 Author's portrayal of Anastas Mikoyan as a miracle-worker who repeatedly fixed the unfixable leads to the impression that the book sometimes focuses more on Mikoyans than on the Soviet position .
 If what is sought is a ‘bird’s eye’ perspective and an aloof historical narrative, the rather personalised interpretation may be seen as a weakness . However, much depends on readers’ expectations; if what is seeking is a 'bird's eye' perspective
 Jim Wilson’s Britain on the Brink, in turn, investigates the British posture during the crisis . Jim Wilson's Britain on Brink is a look at Britain's posture in the aftermath of the war .
 Wilson highlights that the Macmillan government kept the public in the dark and did not take any significant measures to prepare the state and society for a nuclear showdown . The government ordered the Royal Air Force to stay on a ‘high state of operational readiness’ which paled in comparison
 Throughout the book, Wilson carefully summarises the evolution of the British position by juxtaposing it with the development of the crisis in the main ‘theatre’ in the Caribbean .
 In fact, once scrutinised, the main ‘puzzle’ seems more self-evident than the book acknowledges . The main 'puzzle' seems to be self-explained, but it's self-defensible .
 First, Macmillan’s choice would strike most readers as a prudent and reasonable one, for it is not clear how the UK would have been served by military and societal mobilisation .
 Britain on the Brink is a well-written and accessible account of how Britain kept calm and carried on .
 By drawing attention to the weaknesses and shortcomings of the extant interpretations, these studies contribute to our understanding of the crisis that almost brought an end to civilisation as we know it .
 Jesse Ferris’s main argument is that past scholars have overestimated the degree to which the 1967 Six-Day War was responsible for Egypt's twilight years between 1967 and 1973 when its regional influence diminished considerably .
