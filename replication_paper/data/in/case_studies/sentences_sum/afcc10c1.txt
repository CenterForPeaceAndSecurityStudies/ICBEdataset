 The Missile Crisis was never fully resolved, because of Fidel Castro’s refusal to allow UN inspections for nuclear weapons, to ensure that all the Soviet missiles had been removed . In fact, the Cuban leader refused to allow the UN inspections of nuclear weapons .
 JFK’s supposed pledge not to invade Cuba to end the Crisis is so pervasive that it is important to finally put it to rest . However, decades of misinformation about JFK's supposed pledge to not invade Cuba is still pervasive .
 The failure to fully resolve the crisis led to the creation of the C-Day coup plan the following year . This chapter documents that JFK made no such pledge, and shows how the failure to . fully resolve . resolve the . crisis .
 JFK’s Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, explained to us in 1990 that JFK never agreed not to invade Cuba . The reason being that Castro refused to allow UN weapons inspectors into Cuba in the fall of 1962 .
 A transcript of Kennedy’s November 20, 1962 prime-time TV news conference provided the first confirmation of his involvement in the Vietnam War .
 Bechloss was one of the first major historians to question the existence of the pledge . The pledge was made during the Missile Crisis .
 JFK "may have deliberately avoided such an unambiguous commitment," he says . JFK "watered down the pledge" by adding conditions that “had the effect of neutralizing” it, he adds .
 The actions of George W Bush, Saddam Hussein and UN Secretary General Kofi Anan in the fall of 2002 regarding weapons of mass destruction parallel very closely with the words of JFK, Fidel Castro, and UN secretary general U Thant in 1962 . George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein's
 Documents show that Dean Rusk was one of the U.S. officials who encouraged JFK not to make a firm no-invasion pledge in 1962 . Rusk wanted to allow the United States more flexibility in getting rid of Castro, documents show .
 A strategy paper from Rusk’s State Department dated November 7, 1962 called for “maximal United States strategy . . directed at the elimination of the Castro regime,” even as the Missile Crisis was winding down . The paper was published in 1962 .
 A leading Cuban journalist at the time, Carlos Franqui, said that Castro “could never accept the idea of an inspection of any kind by any agency . That would have finished him off” by making him look weak, he said .
 JFK notified Khrushchev that the Missile Crisis was over on November 21, 1962 . UN inspections and a no-invasion pledge still unresolved .
 JFK and members of his administration felt that they had to do something to make sure all the missiles were gone and wouldn’t be reintroduced . JFK’s efforts at the UN had proven fruitless, since their efforts had failed .
 By the spring of 1963, JFK and his key advisers were looking at new ways to topple Castro . JFK was looking at ways to get rid of the Castro regime .
 Rusk agreed that the American public had assumed that there was such a pledge . Rusk said the Kennedys’ efforts in 1963 were all the more risky than they were .
 The U.S. needed a “coup,” not just an assassination or a full-out United States invasion while Castro was still in power . That’s why they needed a legitimate—or seemingly legitimate—”coup” Not just assassination or
 Any U.S. military action against Cuba would have to take place under very special circumstances . They didn’t want to risk a nuclear confrontation with the Soviets, so any United States military action .
 It would have to appear to be a peace-keeping mission, in response to a “palace coup” against Castro, to quote a recently declassified memo . The mission would appear to have been a response to the ‘palace . coup’ against Castro .
 Castro’s refusal to allow the UN inspections led directly to what became the Kennedys’ plan for a coup in Cuba . Dean Rusk explains to us that Castro‘refusing to allow UN inspections in Cuba led to what led to a coup .
 The problem of Cuba remained a growing thorn in the side of JFK into the spring and summer of 1963 . The Cuban crisis was a thorn in JFK's side .
 The report said that concealed missile sites were “quite possible,” a charge that JFK couldn’t completely refute without the UN inspections that Castro wouldn�t allow . The report also said concealed missile bases were ‘quite possible’
 Hawkish sub-committee chairman John Stennis was demanding that JFK take “positive” steps to make getting the Communists out of Cuba his highest priority . JFK was in Cuba at the time of the Cuban coup .
 The U.S. might not be able to find the missiles if they were reintroduced . The report says it would be “possible” for the Soviets “to adopt improved measures of concealment and deception .
 We could not always depend on U-2 spy planes to do the job, since they were now sometimes being approached by Soviet MiG jets . The U.S. was forced to rely on U.2 planes to spy on Soviet jets, which were now being approached .
 JFK had already been planning to take some type of action to prevent the reintroduction of Soviet missiles into Cuba and to resolve the problems with Castro once and for all . However, JFK had been planning on taking action .
 White House memos declassified just a few years ago show that in late April 1963, the Kennedy administration was beginning a major push to eliminate Castro . The Kennedy administration began a push for Castro to be eliminated in April .
 Bobby Kennedy was one of several groups under the control of Bobby Kennedy . The group was just one of a number of groups under Kennedy's control .
 The notes from a different Cuba subcommittee two days later develop the plans further . The plans were discussed at a meeting of Cuba subcommittee members .
 Robert Kennedy assumed the task of dealing with the nuts and bolts of policy implementation, according to journalist Gus Russo . Russo: "This by no means implies that the younger brother was operating without JFK’s implicit agreement"
 The memo also had a section where the Defense Department, the CIA, and Bobby Kennedy’s Justice Department could all check their “concurrences” with the policy . The memo was addressed to President Kennedy .
 April 1963 meetings were not the first time the Kennedys had targeted Castro with a broad plan of covert action . The meetings were held in the same place in 1963 .
 Robert Kennedy was actively involved, though he did not dominate it to the extent he would dominate C-Day the following year . Robert Kennedy would dominate the event the next year, but not the next .
 Operation MONGOOSE has been described as primarily a relentless and escalating campaign of sabotage and small Cuban exile raids that would somehow cause the overthrow of Castro . For decades, the operation was described as mainly a relentless campaign of sabotaging .
 Only in recent years have newly released documents and accounts shown that MONGOOSE also included plans for an invasion of Cuba in the fall of 1962 .
 The military was heavily involved with MONGOOSE, and suggested a variety of outrageous plans to justify the invasion . The plans included blaming the sinking of a ship or the crash of an airliner, or a United States space capsule .
 MONGOOSE was quietly terminated in early 1963 after a demonstrable lack of results . MONGOose was the first organization to use the name MONGOSE .
 Some of the programs were known to the Kennedys and their Cuban subcommittees . Some of those programs were also known by the Kennedy-led Cuban government .
 It was an attempt to find disgruntled military officials who might be willing to recruit higher military officials in a plot to overthrow Castro . It was a search for disgruntled officials in Cuba .
 The Kennedys were starting to scale back their support and shut down the groups’ raids on Cuba . The CIA had been supporting dozens of Cuban exile groups for years, but most were ineffective .
 The CIA had two other major operations against Cuba that were being hidden from the Kennedys in April 1963 . The CIA also had a major operation against Cuba in the same month .
 CIA backing for violent Cuban exile group Alpha 66 . Alpha 66 attacked Soviet ships in Cuban waters during the Cold War . CIA also backed the violent group, Alpha 66, in the 1950s .
 JFK denounced Alpha 66 and tried to clamp down on its leadership . He didn't realize that the CIA was actually directing the group’s activities .
 The other major operation was the CIA’s ongoing plots with Mafia boss Johnny Rosselli to assassinate Castro . The CIA was also involved in the assassination of the Italian Mafia boss .
 The CIA-Mafia plots began in 1959, ramped up in the summer of 1960 prior to JFK’s election . The plots continued even after Bobby Kennedy had assured Bobby Kennedy in May 1962 that they had been stopped .
 These plots were still active in the spring of 1963, with two well-documented attempts . The plots were in existence in 1963 .
 This program was first uncovered by the Senate Church Committee in the mid-1970s . It was uncovered by a Senate Church committee .
 CIA Director John McCone was kept in the dark about the unsanctioned CIA operations . JFK appointee was JFK's first CIA director . McCone is a recent Kennedy appointee .
 CIA officials had far different ideas on overthrowing Castro by 1963 than did the Kennedys . CIA officials who were aware of them, the highest of whom appears to have been Deputy Director for Plans Richard Helms .
 Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Jr., a JFK aide at the time, wrote that “the CIA wished to organize Castro’s overthrow from outside Cuba, as against the White House, the Attorney General's office and State who wished to support an anti-Cast
 Schlesinger worked closely enough with the Kennedys to accurately describe their feelings about Cuba . Sources and documents indicate he did not know about the plan for a coup in Cuba, documents show .
 CIA officials acted as if assassination of Castro by any means was justified . The Kennedys wanted a change in Cuba to be part of a political solution, whether by a coup or a negotiated agreement .
 The Kennedys were very receptive when a Cuban official offered to stage a coup against Castro, if the Kennedy family would back him . The CIA’s sanctioned or unsanctioned actions were having much effect by April 1963 .
