 In 1962, Latin American foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk arrived at the Uruguayan beach resort of Punta del Este to debate Cuba’s position in the Western Hemisphere .
 Representatives from 21 different states with varying political, socio-economic, and geographic contexts, they had divergent goals . Unsurprisingly for a group of representatives, the goals of the group were divergent .
 Delegates at Punta del Este voted by two-thirds to exclude Cuba’s revolutionary government from the Organization of American States . Six nations abstained in the vote .
 The foreign ministers also agreed to an arms embargo, to suspend Cuba from the Inter-American Defense Board . They agreed to examine the possibility of further trade restrictions through the OAS Council .
 Uruguayan Foreign Minister, Homero Martínez Montero, reflected that ‘no other event’ in the twentieth century had shaken the region and disturbed the established order in the hemisphere to the same extent .
 The unanimity with which delegates regarded Cuba’s position in the Western Hemisphere is striking . First, the unanimity in the United States is striking. First, it is striking that delegates regard Cuba's position in Western Hemisphere .
 We tend to think of the Cuban Revolution as polarizing opinion in Latin America and feeding into Cold War divides . The Cuban Revolution was a Cold War divide between Latin American and American opinion, says CNN.com .
 By early 1962 all regional governments subscribed to the view that Cuba’s revolutionary regime was directly at odds with inter-American system . Yet, by early 1962, the Cuban regime was at odds . The Cuban revolution was a major source of tension in the region .
 The question is why and what this tells us about the history of the Cold War in Latin America, says CNN's John Sutter .
 Inter-American meetings before, during, and following the Cuban missile crisis also served as forums for debates on Cuba . The meetings were held before and after the missile crisis in Cuba .
 Diplomatic encounters offer windows through which to grapple with evolution of the Cuban Question in the inter-American system . The emphasis here is the contested move to exclude Cuba’s government from the OAS and then the difficult road to imposing collective sanctions against it .
 Cuba's relationship with the region has received little attention from international historians . Given the impact of the Cuban Revolution on Latin American governments and the inter-American system in the early 1960s, it is surprising that Cuba’s relationship with Latin American countries has been overlooked .
 Scholarship on Cuba’s international relations since 1959 has focused mainly on U.S. responses to the Revolution . Scholarship has focused on the country's international relations .
 We also know quite a bit about Cuba’s foreign policy goals and support for revolutionary movements . Cuba has a long history of supporting revolutionary movements, including the Cuban Revolution .
 Diplomatic archives in the region have only recently opened . To some extent this is because diplomatic archives have only opened recently . This is due to the opening of diplomatic archives in region .
 This was how U.S. government officials privately represented their interactions with regional counterparts . This was certainly how United States government officials .
 Latin Americans saw themselves teaching Latin Americans to understand Cuba’s threat . They saw themselves . Expending enormous efforts managing the ‘noise-level” of information on Cuba through hemispheric media .
 U.S. documents often give the impression that the Latin Americans passively awaited instructions . United States documents often show that Latin Americans are passive waiting for instructions .
 Latin America binary account of the Cuban question can also be tempting . Latin American binary account is tempting, but it can be tempting to ignore .
 Regional governments did not need to be fed stories about Castro to the extent U.S. policymakers believed . Regional governments were not alarmed by the radicalization of the Cuban Revolution or its relations with the Soviet Union with alarm .
 Anti-Communism had a long internal history in Latin America prior to the Cuban revolution . Rooted in Catholicism, the military, and elites’ fear of hierarchical power structures being uprooted anti-Communists had a history in the region .
 Communist parties were banned in eight countries by 1948 . All but three of fifteen states that had established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union had broken off ties by the mid-1950s .
 Latin American documents show anti-Communism in turn fed into interpretations over Cuba . Declassified documents show that this longer tradition of anti-communism fed in to interpretations of Cuba's Cuba .
 Even those governments that held out on imposing sanctions, and were perceived by Washington as “soft” or “trying to sit on the fence” when it came to the Cuban Question, privately condemned Castro’s revolutionary regime .
 Leaders in the region often deferred to the United States, shared similar concerns about the Cuban Revolution with U.S. officials, and were also influenced by United States actions . Leaders often deferring to the U.K. and were influenced by U.N. actions .
 Not all conversations regarding anti-Communism and Cuba were routed through Washington . But not all conversations were routed around Washington .
 The story of the Cuban question in Latin America fits within a . historiography that emphasizes the importance of decentralizing Cold War narratives and recovering Latin American agency .
 As Odd Arne Westad argued in 2005, we need to pay closer attention to ideas and protagonists in Latin America, Asia and Africa to get a sense of the conflict’s global dimensions .
 Historians like Renata Keller, Robert Karl, Eric Zolov, James Hershberg, Aragorn Storm Miller, Thomas Field, and Jonathan Brown have recently shed light on the way in which the Cuban revolution was construed in Latin America .
 Hershberg has tracked Brazilian attitudes to Cuba and Brasilia’s mediation in U.S.-Cuban conflicts of the early 1960s . He has tracked Brazil's attitudes to the island nation .
 Chilean historian, Joaquín Fermandois concretely examined Chile’s interaction with the Cuban Question drawing on the Chilean press and congressional records . In my own work I have also examined Cuba's influence on the left in Chile . Bolivia and the Alliance for Progress in the 6
 Despite the important literature that has already appeared, a great deal remains to be learned . Despite the importance of the study, a lot remains to learn, says author .
 In particular, we need to know more about the influence the Cuban Revolution had on inter-American relations and institutions, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Aim of this article is not to contribute another nationallyor bilaterallyframed study of Cuba’s impact . Aim is to begin piecing together a regional picture of diplomacy surrounding the Cuba question .
 The article builds on the valuable research that Fermandois, Keller, Keller and Keller have already undertaken on Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia’s relationship to Cuba respectively . It adds new perspectives from my own research in Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, and Mexico
 It is impossible in one article to examine all diplomatic and state-level discussions regarding la cuestión cubana throughout the Americas over a five-year period . In my analysis here I d not pretend to provide a full picture of all Latin American governments on the crisis .
 First, I have not had access to all the diplomatic archives in the Americas, and the coverage of those I have consulted has been problematic . Second, he has not been able to access the archives of the U.S. and Canada .
 Allende’s Chile and the Inter-American Cold War are reportedly “missing,” and more often than not, diplomatic cables from the field are far more extensively available .
 Based on what is currently available, this is an initial opportunity to take a broader view of the Cuban revolution’s diplomatic impact and its significance for the inter-American system . The U.S. should take an initial view of Cuba's diplomatic impact, however, but this is
 We can already begin discerning the main turning points, fault-lines, and frameworks used within Latin America to interpret the Cuban revolution, and how they helped shape, and were shaped by, the Cold War .
 This article pays particular attention to countries that were democratic in the early 1960s and that opposed a hardline stance against Cuba in inter-American forums such as Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina . Mexico’s nationalist revolutionary one-party state, Mexico, was one of the
 Brazil and Argentina had three different governments each in the period between 1959 and 1964 . Reformist reformist governments of Jaino Quadros and Arturo Frondizi fell in 1961 and 1962 at least in part as a result of domestic military opposition .
 These perspectives illustrate that resistance to sanctions did not imply sympathy and support for Cuba’s revolution . Even those opposing them were Cold Warriors when it came to resisting Communism in the hemisphere .
 The picture emerges of a region's leaders more united than divided over Cuba’s significance . The picture that emerges emerges is of a . region united over Cuba's significance, rather than divided .
 Far right dictators, conservative democrats, nationalist revolutionaries, and centrist reformers were bound together by a shared antiCommunism that put them directly at odds with Havana’s leaders .
 With Cuba magnifying the Communist threat, conceptualizations of the Cold War in the region also changed . Cuba magnified the threat in the area .
 Anti-Communism had been prominent in the region for decades . Many now spoke about Cuba having brought the ‘iron curtain’ to Latin America .
 Some Latin American leaders increasingly saw themselves and the interAmerican system as part of a global Cold War in the early 1960s directly as a result of the Cuban question . The Cuban question was a key issue in the 1960s .
 Until now, “these calamities had not been felt” in Latin America, he said . Cuba had changed that, he added . Cuba has changed that.
 On the question of what to do about Cuba, the picture is more complicated, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Cuba is a key part of the U.S. relationship with the island nation .
 First, they were constrained in acting more openly against Cuba due to domestic pressure from nongovernmental political actors who sympathized with the Cuban Revolution or actively supported it . The Cuban Revolution was a major source of influence in Cuba .
 The U.S. did not agree that the inter-American system’s post-war institutions and collective security agreements mandated punitive actions against Cuba . Second, they didn’t agree that they should be punitive actions .
 The principle of non-intervention at the heart of the inter-American system, in place mainly to contain the United States, was still considered sacrosanct . The principle was still seen as sacrosian .
 Third, they argued that sanctions would be ineffective and counterproductive . They also argued that they would be counterproductive and ineffective .
 They worried about the precedent that intervention against Cuba would set . Finally, they worried that intervention would set a precedent that it would set.
 They were disdainful of extreme regional anti-Communists who sought aggressive action against Cuba . They were contemptuous of those who sought to take action against them .
 They often regarded the United States interlocutors as more rational hemispheric players . Furthermore, they often regarded their U.S. interlocuttors as a more rational .
 Extreme anti-Cuban lobbyists bemoan what they perceived as lackluster U.S. action against Castro . On the other side of the argument, the Cuban missile crisis was the missile crisis crisis .
 Latin Americans did not line up neatly against or for the United States . Inter-American disagreements were multisided rather than binary . Latin Americans were not always aligned neatly against the U.S.
 U.S. policymakers often missed in their simplistic belief they had to instruct their regional counterparts how to think and act . Only by paying attention to perspectives from within the region can we appreciate the complexity of the region, U.N. policymakers missed .
 Latin America’s Foreign Ministers met at Punta del Este . Diplomats throughout the region had already come to view the Cuban revolution with concern . Latin America's Foreign Ministers shared concerns with each other .
 When Castro gained power on 1 January 1959, he was widely regarded as nationalist, anti-dictatorial, and anti-Communist . Castro was widely considered to be anti-communist .
 Diplomatic observers in the Americas concluded by late 1959 or early 1960 that first impressions had been misguided . However, opinions rapidly changed, with diplomatic observers concluding in late 1959/early 1960 that the situation had been misguided .
 There are several reasons for this change of heart, including the radicalization of the Revolution inside Cuba, the growing influence of Communism on the island, and Havana’s support for revolutionary insurgencies in the region . Cuba's alignment with the Soviet Union and Havana's support for insurgencies
 Left-wing groups in Latin America celebrated these developments, but elites inside and outside the government, democrats, religious groups, and members of the armed forces, were increasingly worried .
 Disenchantment with Cuba was also closely related to how diplomats conceptualized Latin America, its vulnerabilities, and their own domestic political contexts . Diplomats conceptualize Latin America's vulnerabilities and its vulnerabilities .
 Cuba’s new revolutionary government committed itself to respect representative democracy and human rights . The evidence available to observers suggested otherwise . At a meeting of OAS Foreign Ministers in Santiago in August 1959, Cuba committed itself .
 Cuban government's reluctance to hold elections and revolutionary tribunals drew criticism from regional observers . In particular, the new Cuban government’s reluctance to release elections and its revolutionary tribunal hearings drew criticism .
 We tend to associate this kind of condemnation with the United States, but Latin Americans were also outspoken, says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: Latin Americans have been outspoken in the past .
 Brazil’s ambassador in Havana was an early admirer of Castro . He was one of the first diplomats to try and stop summary executions days after Castro came to power .
 The complaints against revolutionary trials could also be farcical . Central American and Caribbean dictators denounced Cuba for being un-democratic and violating human rights .
 It would be a mistake to dismiss all concerns with Cuban policies as the preserve of anti-Communist dictators . However, it would be wrong to dismiss concerns with Cuba's policies as a result of dictatorships .
 Already in April 1959, previously sympathetic Colombian journalists were warning of “The Danger of Excesses” in Cuba . Already in . 1959, already sympathetic . Colombian journalists warned of the dangers of excesses in Cuba in 1959 .
 What made Cuba different in a region familiar with repressive dictatorships was the increasingly prominent role of Communists in government . Cuba's growing influence in the region was the rise of Communists .
 Chile’s ambassador, belonging to an influential and elitist family, ascribed its influence to the island’�s late independence . Rather than exploring the historical appeal of Communism stretching back to the 1920s and 1930s in Cuba, for example, Emilio Edwards Bell
 In Cuba/1960/Oficios Conf. y Ord. and Ord. Aspectos Internacionales,” 19 July 1960, in Cuba/ 1960/In Cuba .
 He warned that “Cuba is heading in the direction of Haíti,” evoking the eighteenth-century slave revolt and the fear it inspired across the Americas .
 Latin American diplomats were increasingly concerned with Cuba’s international alignments . Alongside these prejudices, Chilean prejudices were also expressed .
 Castro’s ties to the Soviet Union loomed large in 1960s . With the U.S.-Cuban relationship deteriorating in 1960, Castro's ties to Russia loomed high . Castro's relationship with the Soviet Soviet Union was strained .
 Diplomats from Brazil and Argentina have engaged in mediation to improve relations between Havana and Washington . The Mexican government also offered to facilitate dialogue . The U.S. and Cuba have been at odds for decades .
 Latin American diplomats from these countries calculated that if further conflict could be avoided, Cuba’s position in the hemisphere and its relationship with the USSR, could be managed, they said .
 U.S.-Cuban hostility is helping Cuba mobilize support and boosting anti-U.S. sectors in the region, Chile says . Chile's Foreign Ministry says it's helping the Cuban government mobilize support . The Chilean Foreign Ministry said it was helping Cuba to mobilize support, boost anti
 Chile’s domestic Cuban problem would “disappear” if U.S.-Cuban relations improved, he says . Chile's domestic Cuban problems would ‘disappararify’ if relations improve, he adds .
 Soviet ties to Cuba increased when the USSR offered to purchase the island’s sugar and invest heavily in its economic development . Even as U.S.-Cuban relations broke down, Soviet ties increased .
 Latin America's diplomats kept a close eye on Cuba’s evolving relationship with the Soviet bloc . Latin American diplomats kept an eye on the evolving relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union .
 It only remained in the inter-American system to “hide its position as a Russian satellite,” he added . The U.S. satellite was only in the system to hide its position, he said .
 Cubans would have preferred Latin American specialists, he says . These specialists encountered language problems, he said, and they would have been better served .
 Regional governments have not shown the same ‘enthusiasm’ for helping Havana’s new leaders, officials say . Havana's new leaders are expected to be welcomed by regional governments, they say .
 Soviet campesinos looked like ‘soldiers’ and were staying in the prestigious Habana Libre hotel, he warned . He said they looked like 'soldiers' implying an ulterior military purpose .
 In many ways, the Cuban Revolution made the Soviet Union more visible in Latin America than it had been before . The Soviet Union became visible in many Latin American countries after the revolution .
 The revolution's outward looking nature and potential to mobilize revolutionary fervor abroad caused alarm . However, very soon after 1959, the revolution’s outward looking . nature and its potential to . mobilize revolutionary . fervor overseas caused alarm at the time .
 No government–in Latin America or elsewhere in the world–wanted to be overthrown . After all, no government-in-Latin America wanted to overthrow the government of Venezuela .
 In 1959, Cuba’s revolutionary regime supported anti-dictatorial insurgencies in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua . In Panama, Cubans, without the apparent backing of their government, participated in an insurrection .
 Latin American diplomats quickly perceived Soviet presence in Latin America to be growing thanks to Cuba . Cuba is a key source of influence in Latin American diplomacy .
 Ambassador Leitão de Cunha told a United States official in late 1960 that he was extremely concerned over Cuban Government’s acquisition of huge stores of arms . He is convinced that the arms are destined for Castro-type extremist groups throughout Latin America .
 The entire continent is facing grave hour and that action must be taken very quickly to remove danger posed by Castro . He expressed opinion entire continent faces grave hour .
 In late 1960, Amoedo warned that, according to “confidential sources,” “communist propaganda” was being sent from Cuba to Argentina via Montevideo . ‘Confidential sources” were said to be behind the Cuban regime’s �
 Argentina’s Foreign Ministry also ordered all its diplomats to report on Communist influence in host countries . Around this time, Argentina's Foreign Ministry was also ordered to report Communist influence . Argentina's foreign ministry also ordered that diplomats report on communist influence .
 The Argentine Chargé d’Affaires in Tegucigalpa warned Buenos Aires in early 1960 that “Communist penetration” was growing “every day” in Honduras as a result of the country's standard of living .
 Argentina’s Foreign Minister Diagones Taboada pressed a similar point in conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter in August 1960 .
 The fear among governments in the region that the Cuban Revolution could mobilize left-wing opposition and/or support revolutionary insurgencies inside their own countries made it an “internal problem” as much as an external one .
 Rightwing dictators tried to control the effect that Cuba’s revolution had on their opponents’ increasing militancy through repression and militarized counter-insurgency . The Cuban revolution was the result of the revolution in Cuba .
 Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Chile and Colombia, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela were more constrained . However, nationalist and democratic governments like those in Argentina and Brazil are more constrained.
 repressive tactics were used at times against left-wing opponents in these countries . Authorities also tried to ameliorate criticism by implementing reforms . Authorities adopted a more moderate stance on Cuba .
 For a similar Chilean perspective, see Edwards Bello to Señor Ministro, ‘Cuba y la OEA,” 19 July 1960, in Cuba/1960/Oficios Conf. y Ord.
 Bolivia’s nationalist President Víctor Paz Estenssoro similarly believed he could only resist pressure from left-wing opponents by refusing to break relations with Castro . As Field argues, Bolivian President Váctor Estensoro similarly .
 Chile’s Eduardo Frei, the reformist Christian Democratic senator and presidential candidate in 1964 campaigning against a left-wing coalition that included Communists and Socialists, also confided that advocating sanctions against Cuba could cost him 100,000 votes .
 President Alessandri repeatedly insisted he did not want the Cuban issue to exacerbate divisions in Chile . He is conscious of critics to the left and the right, and has insisted he does not want it to exacerbate division .
 Latin American governments also had to respond to the right and the military within their own countries by proving they were dealing with the problem of Communism effectively . Elected Latin American countries had to show they had dealt with the issue effectively .
 Alessandri faced sharp criticism in the National Congress for lack of sufficient anti-Communism . He faced pro-Castro protests and mobilization, but was criticized for not dealing with Cuba . The Italian prime minister is expected to take office in January .
 Others in the country–above all people from banking, industry, and commerce–voiced their disquiet . However, others in the industry, including banking and commerce, voiced their concerns .
 Venezuela confronted a “serious internal crisis” over Cuba . The Chilean ambassador in Caracas reported the crisis . Venezuela is facing a "serious internal ... internal crisis"
 Many Latin American diplomats harbored concerns prior to the meeting that were similar to those of their U.S. counterparts . However, many diplomats–including those that represented the so-called moderate group of regional states resisting more hardline action against Cuba – harbored similar concerns before the meeting
 By late 1960, the Cuban revolution was already isolated informally, and even formally, within the hemisphere . The Cuban revolution had already been isolated in the United States .
 Leftwing parties, trade unions, and students in Latin America could count on strong support from leftwing parties and trade unions . Many of them were prepared to go out onto the streets to express their solidarity with the Revolution .
 Others, mostly in Central America and the Caribbean, took up arms . Others vowed to overthrow their governments by force of arms following Cuba’s example .
 A growing state-led consensus among governments and diplomats that Cuba–and the growing Communist and Soviet influence it brought to the region–was a cause for significant concern . On the other side of the Cold War divide, stood a growing consensus among states and diplomats of many different political persuasions
 By 1960, at least on the regional level, the fault-lines of the Cold War did not run between countries but between anti-communist governments on the one side and groups of their citizens who sympathized with, or actively supported, Havana's revolutionary leaders .
 The situation in Venezuela grew particularly acute in this regard from October 1960, with the development of a Cuban-inspired revolutionary insurgency that received Havana’s support in the form of training at least from 1962 . As well as breaking diplomatic relations with Havana and adopting a militarized counter, Venezuela
 The inter-American system had to face was whether to turn shared governmental concern into collective action . The question is whether to use shared concern to turn collective action, he says .
 It did not help matters that the U.S. was regarded as not communicating its own position effectively . The United States did not communicate its position effectively, it was said to be .
 As the Uruguayan ambassador in Washington warned after the Bay of Pigs, the lack of U.S.-Latin America consultation over the crisis had threatened the legitimacy of the Western Hemisphere’s institutional architecture .
 The 1947 Treaty of Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance and the OAS were created in 1948 . They committed the U.S. and Latin American states to collective defense of each other's territory .
 Member states had agreed to a resolution on the “Preservation and Defense of Democracy in America” which labeled international Communism as “incompatible” with the inter-American system when they signed the OAS Charter in 1948 . Member states also agreed that international Communism was �
 This anti-Communist pledge was updated in 1954 at the Tenth Inter-American Conference in Caracas .
 After 1959, Cuba was then in the spotlight with the San José meeting having been the first effort to deal with it . The San Josico meeting was the first of its kind in Cuba .
 The San José Declaration’s failure to name Cuba and recommend decisive action against Castro left many governments unsatisfied . Many governments in the region unsatisfied.
 U.S. officials believed San José had fallen “considerably short” of desired objectives . United States officials believed the mission had failed to achieve its objectives . San José has been the site of a major earthquake in the region .
 Eight foreign ministers had spoken in favor of the right to selfdetermination at the meeting . Fearful of setting a precedent for intervention in Cuba’s internal affairs, eight foreign ministers spoke in favor .
 The meeting had also been convened under the OAS Charter and not the Rio Treaty, meaning it could only recommend measures to be taken . The meeting also had also had to consider measures to take place .
 The United States and Latin American governments that ardently opposed Castro had subsequently begun pushing for Castro's regime . Castro's government had been pushing for a mechanism to end the Castro regime . The U.S. and Latin America pushed for this mechanism .
 Governments in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia have resisted such a meeting . Despite broadly shared concern in Latin America concerning Cuba’s trajectory, governments in Mexico and Brazil have resisted the meeting .
 Until proof emerged of an armed Cuban attack on a Latin American state or a decisive threat to hemispheric peace, they preferred to deal with the situation in the OAS . Domestic politics also factored into their position .
 Chilean Foreign Ministry wanted to avoid the domestic political "complications" that could arise from a new "tribunal" on Cuba . Chile's Foreign Ministry wants to avoid political complications .
 Castro suddenly announced he was a life-long Marxist-Leninist on 1 December . Presumably having failed to get reassurances, and with the OAS vote days away, Castro decided to make the announcement .
 Observers were “extremely surprised” by the announcement, not because they didn't think he was a Marxist-Leninist, but because of its timing, they said .
 Castro’s announcement comes seven months after he declared the Cuban Revolution socialist . The announcement confirmed the ‘incompatibility’ of the Cuban regime with the inter-American system . Castro had declared the revolution socialist seven months earlier .
 Those abstaining or voting against the meeting did so on the grounds that there had been no Cuban “aggression” and thus the Rio Treaty could not be invoked . The Rio Treaty was not invoked, and therefore the treaty was invalid .
 Brazil’s Foreign Minister, Clementino de San Tiago Dantas, noted absence of democratic governance did not imply “radical incompatibility” of a confrontational political ideology . Brazil”s foreign minister said “the deliberate and permanent acceptance’ of a
 The island no longer fitted within the inter-American system, the U.S. agreed by twenty votes to one that it no longer fit within the system . They agreed by 20 votes to . one that the island was no longer .
 Martínez Montero: “26 country had a friendly attitude” at the conference .
 The Cuban revolution’s “incompatibility” was one thing . However, agreeing on the Cuban revolution's ‘incompality was one of one thing, he said .
 As had been the case in San José, a number of concerns complicated agreement . The agreement was reached after a series of high-profile incidents .
 In addition to domestic constraints, the interAmerican system’s commitment to non-intervention and different interpretations of the legal frameworks that existed to manage hemispheric security were key .
 Chile’s Foreign Minister called the “profusion of contradictory ideas” at the meeting . Together, these issues contributed to the meeting, he said . Chile's Foreign Minister calls the meeting a meeting of conflicting ideas .
 The Central Americans’ “intransigence” on the issue was so extreme that not even the U.S. delegation shared their position . As Carlos Martínez Sotomayor, Chile’s new young centrist Foreign Minister .
 On Martínez Sotomayor’s mediation efforts, see also Fermandois, “Chile y la ‘cuestión cubana’” 349 .
 On Martínez Sotomayor’s appointment, his sympathy for the recently formed Non-Aligned Movement, his support for independence struggles in 27 countries . Those arguing against sanctions meanwhile did so on legalistic grounds and the basis of their purpose .
 Tello rejected the idea that there was any proven threat to hemispheric peace or territorial integrity . The TIAR could not be evoked to apply punitive measures .
 U.S. Ambassador Thomas Mann said earlier that year that any action against Cuba would only “only “strengthen the Cuban government and pro-Communist groups” in Latin America .
 Sanctions were likely to increase Soviet bloc assistance to Cuba rather than reduce it . Sanctions also likely increased Soviet bloc aid rather than reduced it, says historian .
 Because 85 percent of Cuba’s trade by early 1962 was conducted with Communist countries, economic sanctions would also have little effect . Cuba's trade with communist countries was conducted in the early years of 1962 .
 Delegates voted seventeen to one with three abstentions for an arms embargo against the island . With a twothirds majority to exclude Cuba’s government from the OAS with six abstents .94 Even so, this decision came at a cost .
 To reach a two-thirds majority, the U.S. delegation had to offer Haiti substantial economic aid . The United States delegation had been forced to offer substantial economic assistance .
 Individual governments faced concrete domestic political costs as a result of their position at the meeting . Individual governments also faced concrete political costs from their positions .
 Most dramatically, Frondizi was overthrown by a military coup d’état the following month in part because his government had not taken a harder line against Cuba . The coup d'état was in part a result of his government's failure to take a tougher line
 Shortly before his overthrow, military generals had forced him, almost with a “pistol at his head,” to break diplomatic relations with the island, he says .
 Fidel Castro issued his most explicit pledge to "make revolution" in Latin America in response to Punta del Este . In what became known as the Second Declaration of Havana, Fidel Castro pledged to make revolution .
 The region had plenty of warning in the region that some sort of showdown was looming . The region was warned by the U.S. that it was about to get ready for a showdown .
 In July, August, and September 1962, Mexican and Chilean ambassadors in Havana warned of growing U.S.-Cuban tensions on the border of the United States military base in Cuba .
 Counterrevolutionary bands and skirmishes appeared to be rising in Cuba . The number of asylum cases grew as Castro’s opponents sought exile in Latin American embassies .
 Edwards Bello reported that there had been a noticeable increase in people, goods, soldiers, and arms arriving in Cuba in early September 1962 .
 Soviet weapons being erected by Soviet technicians did not appear aimed at ‘armed aggression,” he said . He underlined that “Communist infiltration” remained a serious problem in Latin America .
 Fidel Castro attended a major rally held by the Cuban government in late September 1962 . He also appears to have been particularly struck by the sight of 30,000 “sincere and convinced communists” singing the Internationale .
 Afonso Arinos, Brazil’s former foreign minister and senior diplomat at the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, told the Brazilian ambassador more proof of what had arrived was needed before a meeting could be convoked .
 In a conversation with Colombia’s ambassador, Arinos reportedly said he was only aware of ‘technicians’ having arrived in Cuba . Arinos also reportedly stated that he was not aware of "technicians" having arrived there .
 Arinos meanwhile stated that another divided inter-American session on Cuba would be “catastrophic” for the hemisphere . Chile’s ambassador, Arinos, said that another such a session would be catastrophic . Arinos said another such session would also be ‘cat
 The “moment has arrived when they will believe us,” he proclaimed immediately after the announcement . The ‘moment’ has arrived, he proclaimed .
 As a dictator, Luis Somoza Debayle was on the “warpath’s” and highly critical of Washington .
 Right-wing anti-Communists responded to the crisis as a wake-up call . However, it was not just right-wing opponents of the Communist Party .
 President João Goulart ordered Brazil’s air force to prevent the Soviets flying cargo to Havana via Brazil via Brazil . Brazil's air force was ordered to stop the Soviet trade to Havana .
 Argentina and the Dominican Republic provided naval units to support U.S. Navy operations . Argentina and Dominican Republic provide naval units for support .
 Argentina’s position had shifted firmly in favor of the U.S. following a coup d’état against Frondizi in March 1962 . Different branches of Argentina's armed forces now competed to offer Washington military support .
 Governments in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and El Salvador pledged assistance in imposing the quarantine .
 In Venezuela, President Betancourt ordered full-scale mobilization of the country’s armed forces, in part to control domestic upheaval generated by the crisis . The crisis included armed attacks on U.S. targets and an electrical plant .
 At an inter-American level, resolution of the crisis only exacerbated the growing sense of urgency that Cuba generated . In Mexico, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil, too, police and military forces were called on to contain demonstrations and protect key infrastructure .
 Latin American governments that had long-since been arguing for punitive action against Cuba were angry Castro was still in power . Latin American nations were angry that Castro still had control of Cuba .
 Caribbean states would have preferred “the invasion of Cuba and the overthrow of Castro’s regime” as part of the resolution of the crisis, the ambassador in Washington says . Argentina's ambassador to the U.S. reflected on the crisis .
 Latin American diplomats at the United Nations were reported as being “anxious” for news of what the U.S. would now do to resolve the Cuban problem . Diplomats at U.N. were reported to be anxious for news on what the United States would do to
 Washington’s UN ambassador, Adlai Stevenson, reported to Secretary of State Dean Rusk, requests for clarity and action meant that the “important making right decision” had risen substantially .
 U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs met with Latin American ambassadors in Washington . He listened to Latin American “preoccupation over continuing threat” Castro posed and calls for further action .
 Martin and Rusk found themselves on the defensive, reassuring representatives that there was “no basis for return to OAS” as long as it kept up its subversive actions in the hemisphere .
 “trying to find a way of pleasing most dedicated allies” was not easy, he says . However, he said, “Trying to . find a . way to please most dedicated . allies’s “most dedicated allies,” he said .
 Latin American representatives refused to be mollified by these reassurances . They raised concerns about continued presence of Soviet troops on the island .
 Stevenson replied troops were not included in the agreement with Khrushchev . Stevenson replied that troops had not been included in agreement with the agreement .
 At least one of 21 thousand troops had withdrawn from Cuba, he said . He estimated that at least 21,000 had withdrawn .
 The Kennedy administration was fearful that an invasion of the island would lead to another serious U.S.-Soviet confrontation . Although unilaterally involved in various actions against Castro under Operation Mongoose, the Kennedy administration did not want an invasion .
 United States officials sat uncomfortably in between, apparently unable to reassure their most steadfast Cold War allies that they had a solution to the Cuban problem . U.S. officials were unable to convince their Cold War ally that they have a solution .
 Venezuelan government called for action after discovery of arms cache in November 1963 . Three-ton arms cache was discovered in the Paraguaná Peninsula in 1963 .
