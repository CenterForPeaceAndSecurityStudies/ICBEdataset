 Hot doc gives us a glimpse of the two brinksmen’s personal correspondence as they approached the brink of war .
 Historians still believe the Crisis to have been the Cold War’s pinnacle . Cold War historians still believe it was Cold War's pinnacle . The crisis was the first of its kind .
 Less than three months after JFK was inaugurated, the new President launched an invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs . The invasion was the first time the U.S. invaded Cuba .
 Castro regime failed miserably, Castro regime remained firmly in power . Castro regime strengthened its security alliance with the Soviet Union with the USSR . Castro's regime was overthrown in Cuba .
 Cuban-Soviet agreement included agreement to secretly construct nuclear missiles in Cuba . This alliance included a secret agreement that allowed the creation of nuclear missiles .
 On 14 October 1962, an American U2 reconnaissance aircraft photographed the missile sites . The missile sites were photographed by U2 aircraft .
 Kennedy assembled a secret, fifteen-member committee to determine the course of action for the U.S. Upon seeing the photographs of the nuclear missiles, Kennedy assembled the committee .
 October 23, 1962 U.S. Naval photograph shows Soviet nuclear missile sites in Cuba . Do nothing. Do nothing! Do nothing .
 Kennedy was swayed by his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara . He ultimately chose the blockade . The blockade was the result of a blockade .
 He "rebranded" the procedure as a quarantine . A blockade was internationally accepted as an act of war . South and Central American nations supported the move .
 Kennedy announced the existence of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba in a nationally televised broadcast on 22 October 1962 . Kennedy also announced the decision to quarantine the island of Cuba .
 The Secretary General warned that “with the advent of modern types of armament” the United States had “completely lost its former isolation” The U.S. had ‘completely lost’ its isolation, he said .
 Despite its bellicose tone, Khrushchev’s letter ultimately conveyed that he understood and feared nuclear war . Despite its tone, the letter ultimately conveys that he feared and understood nuclear war.
 Next week we’ll look at the President’s reply to Khrushchev, the Crisis’�s resolution, and new evidence proving that nuclear war was even closer than Kennedy believed at the time .
 A large snow storm also blasted Washington just before his 1961 inauguration . The storm also hit Washington in the same year .
 It always sounded to me like JFK listened a lot more closely to his brother – who honestly didn’t really belong in the room, if one looked at the virtues of his position in the government alone – to really make the claim that it was truly ‘rational”,
 The transcripts are a fascinating read from a series of fascinating interviews with journalists . They were tape recorded but the transcripts themselves make a fascinating reading .
 True, people often mistakenly assume that nuclear weapons will always launch and detonate as planned .
 McNamara made an important point when he stated that the missiles in Cuba did nothing to alter the strategic balance . McNamara also made a point that the Cuban missiles did not alter the balance .
 He said in 1990, “It made no difference…The military balance wasn’t changed.” The military balance was not changed, he said .
 Insightful piece– thank you Mr Jones. Melanie .
 Didn’t Kennedy have to give something too . like standing down his missiles in the Mediterranean sea .
 Also doesn’t the U.S. violate other sovereignty’s with impunity . Also doesn't the United States violate other countries with impunity? Don't the US violate other nations with impunity.
 The United States buys up these small countries in order to legitimize their presence in the area . The U.S. buys up the small countries as part of a larger military presence in Africa .
 Kennedy stood down his missiles in the Mediterranean sea . Well…. mr. president, WE DID IT “
