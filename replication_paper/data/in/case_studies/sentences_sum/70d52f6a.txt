 This study surveys and evaluates previous attempts to use game theory to explain the strategic dynamic of the Cuban missile crisis .
 All of the explanations judged to be either incomplete or deficient in some way . All of these explanations were judged to have been inadequate or deficient .
 Schelling’s explanation is both empirically and theoretically inconsistent with the consensus interpretation of the crisis . Howard's explanation is consistent with the contemporary understanding of rational strategic behavior; and Brams’ with the full sweep of the events that define the crisis. Brams' explanation is
 The broad outlines of a more general explanation that addresses all of the foundational questions associated with the crisis within the confines of a single, integrated, game theoretic model with incomplete information are laid out .
 Cuban missile crisis; game theory; threat that leaves something left something to chance; metagame theory; theory of moves; analytic narrative 1.1.2.3.4.5.5 .
 The Cuban missile crisis is an event whose significance in international affairs almost defies hyperbole . It is perhaps no clearer than the attempts by game and decision theorists to explain the crisis . Game theorists are trying to explain why the crisis happened .
 In light of developments, one might well expect that explanations of the crisis have been adjusted and refined . The crisis has been particularly acute in recent weeks .
 Game theorists have been involved in the crisis in the past and in the theory of the crisis . This has been the case in both the general literature and the explanations constructed by game theorists .
 The parallel game-theoretic literature reflects controversies and refinements within game theory itself . But it also reflects controversies within the theory itself itself .
 As game theory has evolved, so have the explanations fashioned by its practitioners . Game theory's explanations have evolved as well as the explanations it has evolved .
 The purpose of this essay is to trace these explanatory refinements using the Cuban crisis as a mooring . The essay is intended to outline a new interpretation of the crisis that exploits both the advances in game theory over time and the expanded evidentiary base .
 Before beginning, however, two preliminary questions must be addressed . "I don't know what I'm going to do with this," says President Obama. "I'm not going to be surprised," says Obama .
 The surveyed explanations will be evaluated by the extent of which all three of these questions are answered . The survey will be judged by the amount of answers to each question .
 In return for a public U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba, the Soviets agreed to withdraw the missiles . In exchange for a . private assurance that United States controlled missiles in Turkey would eventually be dismantled, the . Soviets agreed in return to a public . pledge not . invade Cuba
 The key event to be explained was a political bargain in which both sides gave way . Though there are some who argue otherwise, this analysis will take as its starting point to the fact that there was no clear winner .
 As will be seen, coding the outcome a “compromise’s”, confounds explanation . The outcome of the vote will be known as ‘confusion’
 No one player has an incentive to abandon its strategy given that none of the other players switch to another strategy at the same time . Within game theory, this task is delegated to the game’s equilibria . Equilibria are particular combinations of strategy choices such that no one
 An explanation is … the assurance that an outcome must be the way it is because of antecedent conditions . An explanation must be an explanation for an outcome, an explanation is an assurance that the outcome is due to antecedents .
 Of all the outcomes in a game, only the equilibria are consistent with rational choices by all of the players . Of all of these outcomes in games, only those equilibrian outcomes are consistent .
 The assumption that the players in a game are rational, therefore, leads naturally to the expectation that they will make choices associated with some equilibrium outcome . The assumption is that they make choices that are associated with an equilibrium outcome, such as that of some equilibrium outcomes .
 Game-theoretic explanations and predictions from this expectation are based on this expectation . Game theoretic explanation and predictions derive from this prediction .
 Game-theoretic predictions about future play presume rational choice . The assumption is that an equilibrium choice will be made by each of the players . Similarly, game theory predicts that each player will make a rational decision .
 The precise definition of an equilibrium depends on whether the game’s depiction is dynamic or static . The players have complete or incomplete information about one another's preferences . The definition depends on the game's depiction of the game .
 Technical details between different types of equilibria will be suppressed whenever possible .
 The interested reader should consult Morrow or another standard source on game theory for any omitted particulars . Morrow is a standard source for game theory .
 The benchmark against which all other explanations of the crisis should be measured is Thomas Schelling’s . Schelling and the Threat-That-Leaves-Something-to-Chance is the key to the crisis, writes Andrew Hammond .
 Schelling never actually offered a fully formed explanation of the missile crisis . Strictly speaking, however, Schelling did not offer a full formed explanation .
 An explanation can be pieced together from several lengthy passages about the crisis in the book . Nonetheless, the book is worth reading .
 A Win in this game occurs when one of the players cooperates by choosing C when the other defects from cooperation by choosing D A Compromise is reached if both cooperate . A Win is reached when one player chooses D A and the other chooses C .
 In Chicken, the assumption is that each player most-prefers to win and, failing that, to compromise . Economies 2014, 2 23, is based on the assumption that each of the players wants to win, not compromise .
 Chicken’s defining characteristic, however, is the assumption that Conflict is a mutually worst outcome . Chicken's defining characteristic is the further assumption that conflict is mutually worst . Conflict is the mutual worst outcome, says the author of the book .
 Each player's preference is to back off and allow the other player to win rather than crash head on . In other words, each player’s preference is not to crash head-on .
 The first entry in each cell indicates the payoff to State A, the second to State B . Each player’s highest ranked outcome is indicated by a rank of “4”, the next most-preferred by “3” and so on. The first
 The outcome called Conflict is the lowest ranked outcome of both players in the game . The outcome is called Conflict, and the outcome is Conflict .
 From a game-theoretic perspective, Chicken presents a number of perplexing analytic problems . Chicken presents many of the most perplexing problems in game theory . The game is based on the fact that Chicken is a chicken .
 There are two Nash equilibria in Chicken .3 A Nash equilibrium is the accepted measure of rational behavior in normal-form games with complete information .
 The two Nash equilibria are neither equivalent or interchangeable . But they are associated with different payoffs to the players . The strategies associated with them may not have identical consequences .
 This is especially true in Chicken where the players have symmetric roles . This is particularly true in chicken where the roles are symmetric .
 Schelling's answer to both questions is that the player who is the first to commit to driving straight on will force the other player to swerve, and will thereby gain the advantage . Schelling’s answer to the question is that .
 In a chapter appropriately entitled “The Art of Commitment” he offered several examples of commitment artists at work .
 President Kennedy’s televised speech to the nation on October 22 was one of the most memorable moments in American history . Kennedy's televised speech was a prime example of the nation's first televised address .
 Schelling went on to note that a firm commitment was probably not necessary . Schelling said it was likely not necessary to commit to the project .
 Schelling came to view interstate crises such as Cuba as risk taking contests . Of course, what is true for one player is also true for the other in any symmetric game .
 This is a feature of strategic-form games that many first wave strategic theorists, including Schelling, seemed not to recognize . Schelling: "Strategy games" is a form of games that can be played in a strategic game .
 The canoe may wobble, and neither could be able to stabilize it . Neither could be sure if the canoe starts to wobble .
 In any crisis, there is an autonomous risk of war, says George W. Bush . "There is a risk of things spiraling out of control," he says .
 Schelling’s intuition led him to argue that this was a type of risk that could be used to successfully manage an intense interstate conflict . Schelling argued that this risk could have been used in a successful war .
 The blockade, as measured as it was, still carried with it the possibility of an inadvertent nuclear exchange . But the blockade still carries with it a potential of an accidental nuclear exchange.
 Schelling was not the only one to code the outcome of the crisis as a “win” for the U.S. Schelling called it a ‘win’ for the United States and attributed it to President Kennedy’s adroit brinkmanship .
 Throughout the crisis he coolly and exactly measured the level of force necessary to deal with the threat, he said . But throughout the crisis, he did not rush to rush to the scene of the crisis .
 "Defining a clear and limited objective, he moved with mathematical precision to accomplish it," he said . "He had a very limited objective: Defining and achieving it, he did it very carefully," he added .
 Schlesinger’s interpretation of the crisis has not withstood the test of time and informed historical scrutiny, says John Sutter . Sutter: ‘Schlesinger and Schelling’�s view of events in the 1930s and 1940s has been wrong .
 White House tapes show Kennedy was more nuanced and skeptical about the value of ‘red lines’ than his political acolytes were . Michael Dobbs: Kennedy was a good deal more nuanced, and skeptical, than his supporters were .
 Dobbs and Trachtenberg find little evidence of the mathematically precise manipulation of threat levels that Schlesinger wrote about . Economies 2014, 2 25 .
 Schelling’s view of the crisis as a competition in risk taking can be cast aside, Schelling says . Of course, their empirical observations do not necessarily mean that Schelling's view is cast aside .
 Before rejecting Schelling’s explanation of the missile crisis, a more compelling reason would have to be given . Thus, before rejecting the explanation, Schelling's explanation would have been given .
 Schelling's interpretation of the crisis was problematic in the years immediately after he wrote, it was problematic . In the years after Schelling wrote, a determinative assessment of his interpretation was problematic, he says .
 Robert Powell developed a two-person sequential game model about the same time that Achen and Snidal wrote . Powell developed the model for two people to play . Powell says the model is a "two-person" game .
 In Powell’s model one player begins play by deciding whether to accept the status quo, to escalate the contest by challenging it, or to attack it . Powell's model is that one player must decide whether to attack or accept status quo or accept it .
 If that player chooses not to contest the status quo or to attack, the game ends . The game ends if that player does not challenge the current status quo .
 If escalation is chosen, the other player is faced with similar choices . But if escalation is not chosen, other players are faced with the same choices .
 Four possible outcomes in this model are the same as in Chicken . Significantly, the four possible outcomes of the model are same as Chicken . The model is based on a chicken-like scenario .
 If the player choosing first does not escalate or attack, the status quo prevails . The status quo in the game prevails if the player chooses first to attack .
 If one player escalates and the other does not, the escalating player wins . The escalating player is the player who escalates . If one escalates, the player wins, the other wins .
 If both players escalate, the game continues until one player submits or until the game “gets out of control” and culminates in disaster . And if both player escalates, it will continue until one submits, or until one person submits . The game ends if
 Powell assumes that by choosing to escalate, a player unleashes an autonomous risk, beyond its control, of an all-out war . Powell assumes by doing so, the risk is beyond the control of a player's control, he says .
 Powell shows that the existence of a crisis equilibrium depends on incomplete information, that is, each side’s lack of information about the values of its opponent . Powell: A crisis equilibrium is an outcome that arises after a challenge by one player and resistance by the other .
 The political bargain that brought the Cuban crisis to a close cannot be explained by a mutual fear that things might spiral out of control . The clear implication is that the political bargain is that it cannot be adequately explained .
 If the Cuban crisis were truly a competition in risk taking, there could have been no compromise . There would either have been a clear “winner” or a thermonuclear war .
 Schelling’s interpretation of the Cuban missile crisis and, arguably, of most other intense major power disputes, is game-theoretically inconsistent with what is now a strong consensus among historians and foreign policy analysts . Snyder and Diesing also find no example of the use of
 Powell's model suggests that when deterrence breaks down, the connection between resolve and victory in a crisis does not always depend on a greater willingness to risk war . Powell’s model, however, suggests that . .
 The historical record shows that President Kennedy was more than eager to compromise . Kennedy was willing to offer much more than he did to end the high stakes stalemate that the Soviets called the Caribbean crisis .
 The lack of fit between Schelling’s theoretical explanation and the resolution of the crisis is indeed disturbing . Schelling's theoretical explanation is not fit with resolution of crisis, it says .
 Howard’s analysis begins on Tuesday October 16, the day that President Kennedy was told that the Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba . Howard's analysis begins at 9 p.m. ET on October 16 .
 On October 22, after a full review of United States options, Kennedy announce the blockade . Kennedy announced the blockade on October 22 after a review of options .
 Howard assumes a payoff structure that defines the crisis as a game of Chicken . Like Schelling and most other strategic analysts of this era, Howard assumes that the crisis is Chicken . Howard: "Like Schelling, most of us assume that this is a game."
 In Chicken, Conflict is the worst outcome, and Compromise is second-best outcome, for both players . Recall that in Chicken, conflict is the best outcome . Conflict is worst outcome for both parties, and compromise is second best .
 All-out Conflict would ensue if the Soviet Union decided to maintain the missiles and the U.S. launched an air strike to remove them .
 A Compromise would be reached if the U.S. decided to blockade Cuba and the Soviets responded by agreeing to withdraw their missiles . By contrast, it would be possible to reach a compromise if the United States decided to block Cuba, but the Soviets agreed to withdraw missiles .
 Howard implicitly accepts what is now the standard understanding of the crisis’s resolution, that is, that it was a draw . Of course, this is what happened so Howard, unlike Schelling, implicitly accepts that it happened so .
 As noted above, the existence of two non-equivalent and non-interchangeable Nash equilibria in Chicken confounds a game-theoretic analysis . Each with equal status as a solution candidate, confounds analysis .
 A United States Victory would have occurred if the United States used force to remove the missiles . Similarly, a United States victory would have happened if the U.S. used force .
 Howard altered the underlying game to reflect the possibility that the players might be able to anticipate each other’s strategy choice . Howard's version of the game is based on an idea first suggested by von Neumann and Morgenstern .
 The metagame is rendered and played “in the heads” of the players prior to the play of the actual game . Presuming that each player bases its own strategy choice on the strategy it expects the other to select, a new game—the metagame—is rendered and
 Howard’s reformulation of classical game theory is as a theory of equilibrium selection . One way to think about Howard's theory is that equilibrium selection is based on equilibrium selection in game theory . Howard's new theory of game theory could be used to explain how it works .
 In the metagame, the metastrategies can be interpreted as signals that the players send to one another before the game begins . In the game, players are shown to each other using metastrategy strategies .
 These signals, verbal or otherwise, allow each of the players to anticipate the other’s strategy choice . These signals allow each other to anticipate and anticipate each other's strategy .
 The theory of metagames attempts to model the impact of preplay communication in a non-cooperative game environment . In other words, the theory of meetingagames .
 Howard’s goal is to identify those communication patterns that are consistent with rational choice, that is associated with the metaequilibria . Howard: ‘Rational choice’ is consistent with rationality, and rational choices are associated with rationality .
 An explanation is uncovered when a plausible connection is made between a communication pattern, a pair of metastrategies, and an observed metaequilibrium . Within the theoretical confines of the theory of metagames, an explanation is made .
 Preplay communication allows the players to form a common conjecture about the way the game will be played . Problem of multiple non-interchangeable and non-equivalent equilibria is potentially rendered moot .
 Soviet leadership believed that it could correctly anticipate the U.S. strategy choice of the United States . To illustrate, assume that, as the crisis unfolded, the Soviet leadership thought it could .
 If this were the case, the range of choices available to the Soviet Union would expand . The Soviet Union could have a range of options available to its citizens .
 The third metastrategy of the Soviet Union is conditionally cooperative . Notice that the third strategy was conditionally cooperable . The Soviet Union's third strategy of the USSR is conditionably cooperative .
 Under a mixed strategy equilibrium in a 2 × 2 game, all four outcomes occur with positive probability . All four outcomes have positive probability of positive probability in the game .
 One might expect the compromise outcome in Chicken to occur, but only sometimes, and not necessarily often . Thus, one might expect it to occur in Chicken .
 It provides, at best, a very weak explanation for the resolution of the Cuban crisis . At worst, it provides no explanation at all. All of which suggests that it provides that .
 Two correspond to the Nash equilibria in the original Chicken game while the third is strictly a product of the metagame . The other three are strictly product of metagame.
 The additional metaequilibrium, however, does not materially expand the set of distinct rational strategic possibilities, i.e., it is repetitive . The additional meetaequilibilibilibity does not . materially expand .
 Each player must intend to choose conditionally cooperative metastrategies and convey this intention to the other . To support this outcome in equilibrium, each player must want to see this in equilibrium .
 The United States must intend to cooperate by blockading Cuba if the Soviet Union cooperates by withdrawing the missiles . The U.S. must also intend to blockade Cuba if it withdraws the missiles, the author says .
 This is an interesting and potentially important theoretical result . Economies 2014, 2 29, is published in economics 2014 .
 If it stands a logically consistent rational choice explanation of the political bargain that ended the missile crisis will have been developed, it will be developed .
 Whether it stands, however, depends on the interpretation of the metaequilibria . Whether the theory stands depends on how it was interpreted .
 Each, therefore, describes a logical possibility in a game between rational players . Each of these possibilities is described as a 'logical possibility'
 Which metaequilibrium eventually comes into play depends on what the players expect from one another, or what they communicate to each other, in play .
 In the present example, both players were prepared to cooperate but also indicated that they were willing to run the risk of all-out war (the Soviets by maintaining their missiles and the U.S. by using an air strike to remove them) if the other was unwilling to cooperate .
 If only one of the players was willing to risk war, that player would have won, Howard says .
 If the Soviet Union limits itself to the two metastrategies that do not admit the possibility of the Conflict outcome, Withdraw Regardless and Tat-for Tit, the only remaining metaequilibria are associated with a victory for the United States .
 There is a compelling strategic rationale that suggests that the metastrategies required to effect a compromise would not be selected by rational agents . Worse still, there are compelling strategic reasons to choose a compromise .
 Howard refers to the “sure-thing” metastrategy A/B/B-A . He says it gives the Soviet Union a good reason to suspect that the U.S. would choose it .
 The metaequilibrium associated with these two metastrategies would bring about a Soviet victory, might well evolve in an actual play of the metagame .
 Howard, however, rejects this outcome as the solution to the metagame, and denies that any particular reason exists for singling it out . Howard says he has no idea why it is being singled out .
 Harsanyi argues convincingly that the use of any dominated metastrategy is irrational and, hence, incredible . He argues that using a dominated strategy is irrational .
 A player with a dominant metastrategy always maximizes its expected utility by choosing it . There is no good reason for an opponent to believe that any other strategy would be chosen . In this case, the strategy maximizes the expected utility of a player's strategy .
 This, in turn, implies that a player with a dominant metastrategy should choose it . This, of course, is the case for a player to choose it, and that they should do it .
 If the U.S. were to select its retaliatory metastrategy A/A/B/A and the Soviet Union, anticipating the sure-thing metastrategy M, selects M . Regardless, each player’s worst outcome, Conflict, results .
 It is difficult to ignore Harsanyi’s admonition not to abandon the use of even a weakly dominant strategy . The United States should not abandon its use of such a strong strategy .
 Howard’s metagame theory provides insight into the conditions that are both necessary and sufficient to effect a political compromise during a crisis . Howard's theory suggests that compromise is necessary and necessary in order to deal with crises .
 Howard's explanation of the missile crisis within its theoretical confines can only be considered weak and incomplete . But, because it lacks a normative foundation, Howard says, the explanation is incomplete . Howard: "It's not a theory that explains the crisis in terms of missile crisis"
 Niall Fraser and Keith Hipel’s explanation of the Cuban missile crisis begins . Fraser, Hipel and the Analysis of Options Technique .
 Fraser and Hipel’s analysis of options (or improved metagame) technique should be interpreted, at least in part, as a proto-theory of equilibrium selection . Like Howard's theory of metagames, the theory of the metagame is at least a proto
 Fraser and Hipel's subtle refinement of Nash’s equilibrium concept adds a dynamic element into the analysis of complex conflicts . But unlike Howard's attempt to reformulate classical game theory, they add dynamic elements to analysis .
 Fraser and Hipel’s innovative methodology explores the stability characteristics of every feasible combination of strategy choices in a game . It suggests a path leading to the selection of one equilibrium when multiple equilibria exist . The authors’ methodology is based on the stability of each feasible strategy choice
 CNN's John Sutter analyzes the Cuban missile crisis in Cuba . He begins with the discovery of the missiles on October 16 . Sutter: The crisis began October 16, 1962 .
 Perform no aggressive action, either by doing nothing or by using diplomatic channels to try to induce the Soviets to remove the missiles, 2. Use diplomatic channels or try to use normal diplomatic channels .
 Some of these options are mutually exclusive, while other could be selected concurrently . Clearly, some of these . options are not mutually exclusive .
 The Soviets could not both withdraw and maintain the missiles, although the United States could blockade and attack the missiles sites at the same time . The U.S. could also attack the missile sites in the same way .
 After eliminating mutually exclusive combinations of options, twelve feasible combinations and, hence, twelve different outcomes, remain . After eliminating the mutually exclusive possibilities, 12 feasible combinations of possible outcomes remain .
 A “1” indicates that the option has been selected, a “0” that it has not been selected is a "0" that it hasn’t been selected . A ‘1’ indicates that a decision has been made, or a �
 One option for the United States is to ‘do nothing’, that is, neither blockading nor striking . For instance, one option is to "do nothing," not blockading or striking .
 To explore stability characteristics of the set of feasible outcomes they start with preference assumptions . To explore the stability characteristics, the team starts with a preference assumption . They start with the stability of a set of possible outcomes .
 Fraser and Hipel assume that the U.S. most-prefers outcome 4 (which is brought about when it does nothing and the Soviets withdraw their missiles) to outcome 6 (in which the Soviets pull their missiles in response to a blockade) and so on. Fraser and
 Fraser and Hipel do not provide a detailed justification for their preference assumptions . They ask whether any of the outcomes offer either player a ‘unilateral improvement’ , which is defined as a better outcome a player can induce by 17 .
 The United States has a unilateral improvement from outcome 6, its second-best outcome, to outcome 4, its most-preferred outcome . For example, the U.S. has an improvement of 6 to 4, the best outcome for the United States .
 Overall Stability United States r s u u r u u u . U.S. Player Stability 4 6 5 7 2 1 3 0 11 9 10 8 Preference Vector 4 4 4 2 2 2 11 11 11 UI 6 6 1 1 1 9 9 UI 5 3 10 UI 5
 These steps involve characterizing the stability, or lack thereof, of each outcome . The next step involves characterizing each outcome, or the stability of the outcome .
 Rational outcomes are those for which a player has no unilateral improvements . Rational outcomes for a player are those that have no unilateral gains .
 Sanctioned outcomes designated by an ‘s’ in the row above each player’s preference vector are those for which the other player can credibly induce a worse outcome for a player who acts on a unilateral improvement . The other player's outcome is designated by a �
 A credible action is one which brings about a better outcome for the sanctioning player . The decision to sanction the player is a 'credible' action, says Simon Cowell .
 Unilateral improvement of the United States from outcome 6 to outcome 4 is sanctioned by the Soviet Union since the Soviets can unilaterally induce outcome 0, which the U.S. does not prefer, to outcome 0 . The Soviet Union can unilaterally change outcome 0 to outcome 6, which it prefers
 Unstable outcomes, designated by a ‘u’, are those with an unsanctioned unilateral improvement . The 'u' is a "unsanctioned" unilateral improvement, with a "u" in the name .
 Fraser and Hipel examine the status quo outcome, outcome 0, which was the state of the world on October 15, the day before the missiles were discovered . They examine the state-of-the-world outcome, outcomes 0 and outcome 0 .
 This is the outcome that obtains when the Soviets maintain their missiles and the U.S. does nothing . The United States does nothing. This is an outcome that occurs when the United States maintains their missiles . This is what happens when the Soviet Union maintains its missiles .
 Although outcome 0 is rational for the Soviet Union, it is unstable for the 18 . There is a fourth type, an outcome that is rendered ‘stable by simultaneity’ that does not come into play in their analysis of the missile crisis .
 The United States can induce three other outcomes it prefers to outcome 0 simply by switching to another course of action . Economies 2014, 2 33 U.S. Economies .
 Of these three unilateral improvements, outcome 2 would be the US preference . US preference would be outcome 2 .
 The likely Soviet response to the blockade can be also deduced from its incentive structure . The likelihood of the blockade is also based on the incentive structure of the Soviet government .
 At outcome 2, the Soviets have a unilateral improvement to outcome 6, which it can bring about by withdrawing missiles . At outcome 1, the Soviet Union has an option of withdrawing missiles from the sky .
 By definition, neither player can do better at equilibrium by unilaterally switching to another course of action, the game would end there . The game would rationally end there, and neither player could do better by switching to a new course . Neither player can unilaterally switch to another action, and the
 Fraser and Hipel successfully explain why the U.S. blockaded Cuba and why the Soviets responded by withdrawing the missiles .
 The dynamic process they explore did not stop at that point . What they are unable to explain, however, is why the dynamic process didn't stop .
 The United States has a unilateral improvement from outcome 6 to outcome 4, which is also an equilibrium . Notice that the U.S. has improved from outcome 4 to outcome 6 . The U.N. has a bilateral improvement from outcomes 6 to outcomes 4 .
 Outcome 4 Pareto-superior to outcome 6 is a more accurate description of the flow of events that brought the crisis to a close . Moreover, outcome 4 is more accurate than outcome 6 .
 Once the Soviets withdrew their missiles, the U.S. dropped the blockade . After all, the United States dropped its blockade of North Korea .
 A unilateral improvement from an outcome is sanctioned for a player if the other player has a credible response that leaves the player acting on the unilateral improvement worse off . Recall that a unilateral improvement is sanctioned if the player acted on the outcome worse off.
 The criterion limits each player’s foresight to a single move and counter-move . In effect, this criterion limits the player's foresight .
 The U.S. should consider the consequences of three moves rather than just two, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Fraser and Hipel fail to fully extend the strategic logic of their model, they say . With laudable but nonetheless perplexing consistency, then, they fail to extend their model . Fraser, Hipel and Fraser have been criticised for their approach .
 North Korea's explanation of the missile crisis necessarily falls short of the mark . In consequence, their explanation for the crisis falls short, they say .
 While it uses the input of their improved metagame technique, it is not a game-theoretic model . It is not the first time the team has used a new metagame model .
 Here I concentrate on the theoretical core of all his explanations and ignore the subtle differences that set the various explanations apart .
 Like Fraser and Hipel, Brams abandons both a normal-form representation and the standard Chicken analogy . Brams says he wants to use the Chicken analogy in his work .
 The ordered pair in each cell of the matrix reflects Brams’ understanding of the relative ranking of the four possible outcomes by the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively .
 Brams assumes that once a game begins either player can move from whatever outcome is the initial state (or status quo outcome) and, if it does, the other can respond, the first can counter-respond, and so on . Brams: Once a game starts, either player
 The process continues until one player decides not to respond, and the outcome that they are at is the final outcome .
 The compromise outcome can also be supported in equilibrium if Khrushchev either deceived the U.S. by suggesting that the compromise outcome was his most-preferred or if his preferences “deteriorated” as the crisis progressed .
 Brams constructed an extensive-form game model in which the compromise outcome is Nash equilibrium . Brams also constructed a Nash equilibrium model for the game .
 When Kennedy announced the blockade on October 22, the Soviet missiles were already being installed in Cuba . The blockade was already being implemented by the Soviet Union .
 This, the initial state of the world, was the worst for the U.S. and best for the Soviet Union . This was the first state of world, and the best for Soviet Union, the author says .
 Brams suggests several reasons why the Soviet Union would then withdraw missiles and induce its next-best outcome, the Compromise outcome, rather than stick with its initial choice .
 If the U.S. possessed threat power, which is the ability to threaten a mutually disadvantageous outcome in the first play of a repeated game, it could induce the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles by threatening to remove them with an air strike .
 The missiles were withdrawn by the Soviet Union in the 1980s . The Soviets withdrew the missiles, but it was not clear why .
 Brams’ explanation is that the Compromise outcome is a nonmyopic equilibrium . Neither player can do better by moving the game to another state of the world by changing its strategy choice, given that the other might then switch to another strategy .
 At the last node of this tree, the U.S. has a choice of staying at its second-worst outcome or cycling back to the Compromise outcome . The United States has the option of cycling back into its second best outcome .
 The U.S. would anticipate the outcome induced by the American choice at the subsequent node, which is better still . But it would do so not because it prefers to — which it does, but because it would anticipate an outcome that would be better .
 Counter-intuitively, perhaps, the United States would, at the second node of the tree, also rationally move to its best outcome, not because it is its best, but because it prefers to cycle back to the Compromise outcome, which is its second-best .
 Brams argues that the Soviet Union would stick with its choice to withdraw missiles simply because, by not doing so, it would only cycle back to the Compromise outcome . Brams says that by not withdrawing missiles, the USSR would only repeat its decision .
 It would be a straightforward exercise to show that there is also no incentive for the U.S. to precipitate the move-countermove process .
 Neither player has a long-term incentive to move away from this outcome if and when it is reached, it constitutes a nonmyopic equilibrium . And since neither player has an incentive to change this, it's a non-myopic .
 As an equilibrium, the Compromise outcome is, by definition, consistent with the rationality postulate . As a result, the equilibrium is consistent with rationality postulates . The equilibrium is an equilibrium between the two sides .
 Brams shows that it was in the interest of the U.S. to allow the Soviet Union to precipitate the move counter-move process rather than initiate the process itself .
 Economies 2014, 2 37 believed that maintaining them would not be in their long-term interest . Economies said maintaining them was not in the best interests of the country .
 Given the U.S. blockade and the incentive structure of the game, they simply could not win . Given the American blockade and incentive structure, the game could not be won .
 The Theory of Moves is a simple and extremely intuitive methodology for analyzing complex interstate conflicts like the missile crisis . It is also more general than the analysis of options technique developed by Fraser and Hipel .
 In the case of the missile crisis, however, its strengths are also it weaknesses . In the past, the U.S. has been criticized for its lack of transparency in the past .
 The concept of a nonmyopic equilibrium has not as yet been successfully defined in games in which the players have more than two strategies each . It can only be used to assess the rationality of four outcomes at a time . The concept has not yet been used in games where players have two
 Brams starts his analysis on October 22, the day Kennedy announced the blockade . This limitation explains why Brams started his analysis the day that Kennedy announced it .
 These are questions that Brams does not address and, in fact, cannot address within the confines of a single integrated game model using the Theory of Moves framework . Brams says he cannot address these questions with the theory of Moves .
 The author's analysis of the end-game of the crisis is both insightful and penetrating, but his explanation remains incomplete . Thus, while his analysis is insightful, it is incomplete, he says .
 By the mid-1980s it was apparent that a sea change was underway in the game-theoretic literature of international relations .
 First, there was a distinct shift away from the static environment of strategic-form games, where the central equilibrium concept is Nash’s, toward the dynamic framework provided by the extensive-form . The accepted measure of rational behavior is Selten's concept of a subgame perfect equilibrium
 The until-then standard assumption of complete information fell by the wayside . And second, the analysis of games of incomplete information became the norm .
 In an extensive-form game of incomplete information, rational choices are associated with perfect Bayesian equilibria . R Harrison Wagner was the first to make use of the theory of games with incomplete information to analyze the Cuban crisis .
 U.S. and Soviet Union's crisis bargaining model is based on the choices and sequence of moves made by the two countries . Unlike a Nash equilibrium, a subgame-perfect equilibrium requires the players to plan to choose rationally at every node of the game tree .
 Players can choose an action choice for every type of every player at every decision node or information set belonging to the player . As such, the player's actions can be used to make decisions for each type of player .
 Each player must indicate how each player updates its beliefs about other players’ types in the light of new information obtained as the game is played out .
 Economies 2014, 2 38, 238 respond in a more aggressive way; and for the bargain that ended the crisis to have come about . The world's second largest economies will have to respond to the crisis in 2014 .
 Wagner constructs a set of strategies consistent with the rational choices of both Kennedy and Khrushchev, given their inferred preferences and beliefs . Wagner then constructs a equilibrium equilibrium, or a series of strategies, that is consistent with both Kennedy's rational choices and beliefs, in his model .
 Khrushchev's refusal to halt work on missile sites provided him with valuable information about Kennedy’s preferences . The characteristics of the equilibrium he discovers suggests that the . characteristics of this equilibrium suggests Khrush .
 Wagner argues persuasively that the crisis was not a ‘competition in risk taking’, as Schelling suggests . Rather, it was an exercise in bargaining and information gathering that is consistent with the fact that both Kennedy and Khrushchev lacked complete information about one another�
 Wagner’s conclusion was based, in part, on his belief that the Soviets never put their bombers on alert . Wagner: The Soviets never had their planes on alert. Wagner's conclusion is based on a belief that they never had a bomber alert .
 Schelling's interpretation of the crisis is inconsistent with Schelling’s interpretation . Nonetheless, the fact that the Soviets did not make their alert known to the United States decision-makers is inconsistent .
 Wagner’s study provides a plausible and insightful description of the strategic dynamic that characterized the missile crisis . Wagner's study was published in Economies 2014, 2 39 .
 At the same time, it falls short of providing a compelling explanation . CNN.com: "It's not a mystery. It's a mystery"
 Of course, the identification of a plausible explanatory equilibrium in a general model is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for a fully satisfying explanation of any real world event .
 Wagner’s approach does not allow him to identify co-existing equilibria . Wagner's explanation of the missile crisis must, ultimately, be judged incomplete, he writes .
 The empirical fit between this model and the strategic dynamic of the missile crisis is especially close . I claim that it is able to generate a more complete and a more satisfying explanation of the crisis than any of the attempts evaluated in this essay .
 There is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of this incomplete information model that is uniquely consistent with the beliefs and the action choices of the U.S. and the Soviet Union and, significantly, with the eventual resolution .
 This equilibrium, which is a member of a family of perfect Bayesian equilibria called the Constrained Limited Response family, is able to address all of the foundational questions associated with the crisis . In consequence, this equilibrium is a . member of the . family of . perfect Bay
 Soviet actions were motivated, at least in part, by the clear expectation that the U.S. would not respond . It was thought that the Kennedy administration would be unwilling to respond forcefully or because it would be too late to do so .
 By contrast, an air strike and/or an invasion carried with it an unacceptably high risk of a superpower war . An air strike or an invasion carries with it a risk of war risk of superpower war.
 The strong belief that that that an escalatory response was likely to lead to an all-out conflict is required for a limited conflict to occur under any Constrained Limited-Response equilibrium . Needless to say, the strong belief . that that . an escalator response was . likely to
 Wagner, of course, reaches the same conclusion but constructs an equilibrium to conform to the fact rather than deducing the fact as a theoretical implication of a general model of interstate conflict initiation .
 The short answer is that the Soviets got the message implicit in the blockade and other signals, intended or not, sent by the U.S. The Soviets got a message, writes CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: "The short answer to this is that they got
 The Soviet decision to withdraw the missiles was the rational response to the additional information they acquired about U.S. preferences while the crisis was playing out . All of which is to say .
 Clearly, space and other considerations preclude a full description of the model or a detailed discussion of the explanation derived from it . Economies 2014, 2 41, is published on October 4, 2014 .
 The equilibrium structure of the model is neither ad hoc or post hoc; rather it flows naturally from the model’s a priori theoretical expectations . Suffice it to say that the explanation implicit in the equilibrium structure is not ad hoc .
 This is not necessarily at odds with most of the other game-theoretic explanations discussed in this essay . It is more general . And while it's not necessarily correct, it's more general. It's not always correct .
 It is also a claim that must be evaluated in a different venue, and by others . Unfortunately, it is also an evaluation of the claim that needs to be evaluated by others.
 All the attempts were judged to be either incomplete or deficient in some other way . All attempts to complete the project were judged incomplete, deficient or incomplete .
 Schelling’s “threat-that-leave-something-to-chance” fails as an explanation on both theoretical and empirical grounds . Schelling: “Threat that’ll leave something to chance” is not true .
 Formal analyses of this bargaining tactic reveal it to be inconsistent with the consensus interpretation of the crisis’ outcome . Formal analysis of the bargaining tactic reveals it is inconsistent with a consensus interpretation .
 There is scant empirical evidence that the Kennedy administration manipulated the risk of war during the crisis with “mathematical precision” as Schlesinger and some other insider accounts have claimed .
 Nigel Howard’s metagame analysis of the missile crisis also fails to provide a compelling explanation for the crisis . Nigel Howard's analysis of missile crisis is also lacking a compelling reason .
 Howard shows the superpower compromise that settled the crisis is a meta-equilibrium in his game model . Howard shows that the compromise is consistent with a minimal definition of rational behavior . Howard: The superpower compromise was consistent with his model of rationality .
 Howard is unable to explain why rational agents would settle on the compromise meta-equilibrium . Howard says one of the players in his model would lose if it were “perfectly rational’s” model were ‘perfectly’ rational .
 A rational choice explanation that rejects even some of the logical imperatives of the rationality postulate is less than satisfying . Needless to say, rational choice explanations .
 The improved metagame technique of Fraser and Hipel falls short of the explanatory mark . Similarly, the improved metagagamming technique is short of explaining itself .
 Fraser and Hipel find that the compromise outcome is an equilibrium in their dynamic model . But they are unable to explain, at least game-theoretically, why it, and not another co-existing equilibrium, ended crisis .
 The co-existing equilibrium is in fact a more accurate description of the eventual resolution of the crisis than is the equilibrium implied by their modeling technique . Making matters worse, the equilibrium is more accurate than that of the modeling technique.
 The description of the crisis begins after the missiles were installed, they fail to address one of the three critical questions that a . complete explanation of the . crisis requires . Finally, since their description . begins with the missiles being installed, the question is still unanswered .
 Brams’ theory of moves framework avoids the arbitrary foresight limitation that Fraser and Hipel assume of the players in their model . Brams has been criticised for his approach to the study of chess .
 It also mitigates some of the problems associated with the existence of multiple, co-existing equilibria .
 Wagner’s model makes use of the modern methodology of games of incomplete information . The model does in fact address all of the central questions about the crisis, says Wagner .
 Wagner's model is carefully constructed from the facts of the crisis as they were known to him at the time . Wagner’s model was carefully constructed . Wagner's models are carefully constructed and carefully constructed to reflect the facts .
 It can be considered a concise and even more than plausible description of the events of October 1962 .
 Theories and models that are constructed from facts cannot but fail to explain those facts . Theory and models cannot be built from facts, the author says .
