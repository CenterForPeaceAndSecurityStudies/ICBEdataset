 The analysis uses data derived from primary source materials that have become available only in the last 2 years . The analysis includes well-known public statements by the president .
 The Verbs in Context System was used to generate insights into how Kennedy’s operational code differed across sources and changed during the period of the crisis .
 The results provide evidence of Kennedy’s initial private belligerence and provisional support for the “Gettysburg thesis” while also calling into question some other potential interpretations of the effects of the crisis on the president .
 The Cuban missile crisis is generally thought to have brought the world closer to nuclear destruction than any event before or since . John F Kennedy was president of the United States when the crisis occurred .
 It occupies a unique place in the history of U.S. foreign policy and superpower relations in the Cold War era . As a result of its role, it occupies a special place in history .
 Scholars from three generations and virtually all social science disciplines have examined the crisis from innumerable angles . Scholars have examined it from all angles, including from the social sciences .
 As the temporal restrictions on document classification have expired, the emergence of new information from domestic and foreign sources has continued to fuel academic interest in the events of the autumn of 1962 .
 John F Kennedy was the most prominent figure in the crisis from the American perspective . In this study I examine the manner in which those events affected the belief system of the President John F. Kennedy . The study examines the effect of those events on the American view .
 I use the Verbs in Context System to generate insights into how Kennedy’s operational code differed across sources and changed during the period of the crisis . VICS is a system that generates insights into the code .
 I note four patterns that recur in the qualitative historical literature and, after defining them in terms of belief change, conduct an analysis aimed at exploring the veracity of the observations . I note . Four patterns that repeat in the . qualitative . historical literature .
 A third pattern concerns the belief change that Kennedy may have exhibited as the crisis unfolded . Kennedy's belief change may have occurred in the wake of the crisis .
 Sorensen and White both noted that throughout the earliest stages of the crisis, Kennedy was angered by the Soviet actions . Kennedy angered by Soviet actions throughout the early stages of his presidency .
 Schlesinger indicated that although Kennedy was initially furious at Khrushchev and Dobrynin, his demeanor changed almost immediately to that of a sober and calculating tactician . However, he indicated that, although initially furious, Kennedy was a sober, calculating strategist .
 This raises the question of when Kennedy’s initial belligerence abated . Kennedy was reportedly belligerent at the start of his presidency .
 A fourth pattern is one that has only recently been identified by comparison with these others . The pattern was only recently identified by comparing it to the other patterns .
 It is the disparity between the public and private aspects of Kennedy’s handling of the crisis . The disparity is the public versus private aspect of his handling of this crisis .
 The Cuban missile crisis has long been understood as consisting of an American ultimatum and a Soviet withdrawal . This newer perspective raises questions concerning the difference between the public and private conduct of crisis management and the attendant beliefs involved .
 The United States, it was understood, held a preponderance of conventional forces in the area of dispute . The U.S. held a pre-eminently dominant position in the region of dispute.
 The Soviets were presented with an ultimatum of either withdrawing their missiles or preparing to fight a nuclear war . The Soviet Union was forced to withdraw its missiles or prepare to fight nuclear war.
 Robert Kennedy’s secret meeting with Dobrynin to discuss this arrangement has also come to be part of the historical record . Robert Kennedy's secret meeting to discuss the arrangement also comes to light .
 These newer analyses predict a disparity between Kennedy’s public utterances and private rhetoric . Kennedy has been accused of being a hypocrite in his public statements .
 In the case of the missile crisis, the nature of the U.S.-Soviet relationship was much more cooperative than one would expect from an examination of the public record . It would appear from the historical accounts, it would appear that the relationship was cooperative .
 A second pattern suggested by some analysts stands in partial contrast to the simpler public-private dichotomy outlined above . Some analysts suggest a second pattern suggests that the pattern is not the same .
 This pattern should manifest itself most clearly in a shift in Kennedy’s operational code over time . Kennedy's operational code should change over time, he says .
 His view of the political universe should be initially hostile, his optimism should be low, and we should also expect his strategic and tactical propensities to be conflictual . That is, of course, his view of politics should be hostile .
 Kennedy’s shift away from an angry response toward a reasoned strategy occurred rapidly, Schlesinger says . Kennedy's shift from angry anger to reasoned strategy was rapid, he says .
 The “overconfidence thesis” stands in contrast to the Gettysburg thesis . The ‘overconfidence’ thesis is based on Gettysburg’s ‘Overconfidence” thesis .
 There was great relief among the United States decision-makers as the crisis was resolved . The U.S. government is relieved at the resolution .
 The U.S. perceived that the escalation of pressure on adversaries worked in this instance and that, eventually, when met with the appropriate degree of threat or force, any adversary would back down, even a superpower .
 If Kennedy did become overconfident, we would expect hypotheses 17, 18, and 19 to be reversed . We would expect hypothesis 17 to 18 to 17 to 17 .
 The predictability index should be higher at the end than at the outset of the crisis . The locus-of-control indicator should be lower than the role-of chance indicator .
 To test these hypotheses, I divided the period of the crisis into phases based on the important turning points in Kennedy’s state of mind according to the secondary literature .
 Kennedy's suspicions of Soviet buildup in Cuba began in late August . Evidence of Soviet conventional force buildups and rumors of missiles focused Kennedy’s attention on Cuba . Kennedy had suspicions on the Soviets .
 Kennedy’s beliefs would be in a state of flux because of some uncertainty regarding Soviet actions and motives . During this phase, up to the point of decision, it is my contention that . Kennedy would be uncertain about Soviet actions .
 By the evening of 18 October, the process of problem recognition was virtually complete . Problem recognition is virtually complete for the first time .
 The blockade would not actually be announced until 22 October and implemented the morning of 24 October . The blockade was announced on 22 October .
 After this series of early meetings, the focus of the ExCom discussion shifted . However, after this, after the meetings, it has shifted the focus .
 Vice President Lyndon Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Under Secretary George Ball, Latin American Assistant Secretary Edwin Martin . Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Defense Secretary Roswell Gilpatric, Assistant Secretary Paul Nitze and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
 Authors focused on the role of stress in patterns of cognition . They placed emphasis on the discovery of missiles as a stress-inducing development .
 Earlier attempts to conduct content analyses of either the McBundy transcripts or meeting memoranda have also focused on temporal changes in ExCom meeting dynamics but have been severely limited by data availability .
 Purkitt adopted an earlyversus late-crisis approach . By focusing on 2 days of meetings at the beginning and end of the crisis, Purkit adopted a late crisis approach .
 Anderson’s study, the earliest of these attempts, used memoranda generated by 3 days of meetings late in the crisis and contained no early samples . Anderson correctly predicted that this limitation would be overcome in time . Anderson predicted in time that the study would overcome .
 In particular, contingent military preparations, diplomatic maneuvers in the Organization of American States, and likely Soviet responses occupied Kennedy and discussants .
 On this day the superpowers came closer to nuclear war than at any other time . As we have been told numerous times, on this day we have a reminder of the day .
 Soviet freighters steamed toward Cuba, joined by a contingent of submarines, and American naval vessels moved to intercept them . ExCom waited for news .
 Robert Kennedy observed, “These few minutes were the time of gravest concern for the President.” Robert Kennedy . Robert Kennedy: ‘These few . minutes were a few minutes . The President. was at the center of the President’s greatest concern. Robert Kennedy
 As news arrived concerning the actions of the Soviet ships, tensions eased . As news of the actions eased, tensions in the region eased .
 Kennedy and Khrushchev corresponded frequently and the basis for a settlement began to emerge . In this “post-decision” phase, Kennedy and his Soviet Union government began to negotiate a settlement .
 Khrushchev’s statement on 28 October, indicating that the missiles would be withdrawn, marks the onset of phase 4, the “resolution” phase . The missile withdrawal marks the beginning of the ‘resolution’ phase .
 Kennedy’s press conference remarks indicated that Khrushchev had kept his promise . This phase ended on 20 November, when Kennedy's press conference . Kennedy's statement indicated that he had kept promise .
 The record of Kennedy’s public statements and the transcripts of the private ExCom meetings were examined for each of these periods to determine which utterances satisfied the 1,500-word minimum length required by VICS sampling criteria .
 Each of the transcripts of the ExCom meetings was examined to generate an estimate of the quantity of the discussion that Kennedy alone generated . Kennedy was the president of the United States in 1973 .
 Virtually all of the transcribed meetings satisfied the 1,500-word minimum for Kennedy content . Virtually every meeting was met with a minimum of 1,000 words .
 Those meetings where Kennedy’s participation amounted to less than 1,500 words, and a private recording that he made in the Oval Office on 18 October, were excluded from the sampling frame . The private recording was also excluded .
 In the private sphere, more than one utterance satisfied the length criteria in three of the four periods . In the public sphere, the length of each utterance was shorter than three times the length required .
 In the public sphere, only the first period offered more than one utterance that could be coded . The first period was the first to offer more than a single utterance .
 In the interest of maximizing comparability across phases and limiting the introduction of confounding factors into the analysis, the private recording was excluded from the analysis . The private recording of the private recordings was excluded .
 The efforts of the authors in getting these transcripts made far exceeds any comparable efforts to date . The authors hired transcription services, audio specialists, and court recorders, including historians and former staff members .
 The May and Zelikow transcriptions must be considered the most complete data set available of Kennedy’s private utterances during the crisis .
 For the ExCom meetings, a decision was made to sample day by day in order to control for the possibility that the day’s earlier meetings were devoted to intelligence assessment and dissemination, whereas the later meetings were more focused on assessments and discussion .
 After a day was randomly selected, all of that day’s meetings were selected and treated as separate measures . All of the meetings were considered separate measures of the day .
 A 20% sample of each of the utterances was randomly selected and coded by a second coder with equivalent training and experience with the method . All utterances were coded by the same coder as I coded .
 No statements were actually communicated by Kennedy . Two White House statements were issued during this time, but no statements were made .
 No public or private utterances were coded for that period, leaving only three periods for comparison . As a result, no public or public utterances have been coded .
 These analyses included the phase, the source of rhetoric (public or private) and the interaction of phase and rhetoric as sources of variance . These analyses include the phase of the rhetoric as a source of variance as well as the interaction between phase and source .
 The ANOVA results indicate the presence of significant differences between Kennedy’s public and private rhetoric and differences across phases . However, the F scores alone do not indicate the nature of this difference .
 The scores for strategy and tactics are consistently more negative in Kennedy’s private rhetoric throughout the crisis . Kennedy's private rhetoric has been consistently negative in his private rhetoric .
 The political universe and optimism indices, although roughly equivalent at the outset of the crisis, become substantially more positive in Kennedy’s public rhetoric as the crisis progresses . Kennedy's public rhetoric becomes more positive as crisis progresses, according to the political universe .
 The pattern of private and public difference that is indicated by these indices holds across phases . We can state with some confidence that the pattern of public and public differences holds across phase .
 Kennedy was on the whole more negative in his private rhetoric in all phases of his presidency . Kennedy was "more negative in private rhetoric" than anyone else .
 Kennedy and his advisors were often involved in crafting contingency plans for worst-case scenarios . Kennedy was often involved with crafting plans for his administration .
 Their lossprevention perspective often led to the consideration of some extreme options, such as invasion, nuclear retaliation, and even all-out war . Losspreventionists often considered invasion and nuclear retaliation .
 There was little discussion regarding more positive, goal-oriented approaches to negotiated settlement . There were little discussion about more positive approaches to negotiating settlement .
 Kennedy could comfortably express the full range of his views in private . Kennedy could easily express his views privately . He could also express those views in public .
 This included voicing his anger at Khrushchev and his uncertainty about Soviet motives . He also voiced his anger over Khrushchetsky's decision to take action .
 He could not articulate his beliefs in public, where he might be held accountable for them, he said .
 The second set of hypotheses relates to allegations of Kennedy's initial hostility and anger over Khrushchev’s actions and the time at which this hostility abated . The other hypotheses relate to allegations that Kennedy was angry and angry at the time of the incident . Kennedy's anger at Kh
 The results of the analysis indicate that Kennedy did appear belligerent during the earliest phase of the crisis . The analysis shows that Kennedy appeared belligerent in the early stages of his presidency .
 This is consistent with the expectations generated from the . qualitative literature, expressed in hypotheses 5 to 8 . This is . consistent with expectations generated . from the qualitative literature and expressed in hypothesis 5 to . 8 .
 Virtually all of the observed changes in Kennedy’s beliefs appear to have occurred after the crisis had entered the resolution phase .
 Kennedy appeared initially belligerent, but this belligerence was only minimally diminished until the crisis was all but resolved . Kennedy indeed appeared belligerent but his belligerence only diminished until crisis was resolved .
 This observation contradicts hypotheses 9 to 12 but confirms hypotheses 13 to 16 . It leads naturally toward the examination of lessons drawn from the crisis and the final hypotheses that relate to the nature and trajectory of Kennedy’s beliefs .
 Separate one-way ANOVA analyses comparing phases 1 and 2, first for private utterances only and then for all utterances combined, revealed no significant differences between the VICS scores . The generally cooperative trend in Kennedy’s main philosophical and instrumental beliefs was found to be the
 Approach to Goals .8 .4 .6 .6 SOURCE -.6 Public -.8 Public -8 Public . -1.0 Private . 1 2 4 1 2 .2 .
 Estimated marginal means, by phase and source of VICS indices, for Kennedy’s main philosophical and instrumental beliefs . Kennedy's main philosophical beliefs are that he believes in the United States .
 The indices for predictability of the political universe, locus of control, and role of chance were designated as the ones that would most clearly indicate which of these lessons Kennedy might have taken to heart .
 The predictability of the political universe declines as the crisis ends, as does the locus-of-control variable . Kennedy felt less in control of the U.S.-Soviet relationship after the crisis, the author says .
 These results are consistent with hypotheses 17, 18, and 19, respectively, respectively . These results were consistent with hypothesis 17,18 and 19 .
 None of these differences across phases is statistically significant . We can exclude the possibility that Kennedy was overconfident and interpret the results as provisional confirmation of the Gettysburg thesis .
 VICS analysis of the nature of Kennedy’s belief change during the Cuban missile crisis . Results from the analysis confirm Kennedy's private hostility at the outset of the crisis . Conclusions: The results confirm Kennedy was private hostility .
 There was not a great change in Kennedy’s approach to the crisis in the early stages, say experts . They also suggest, contrary to some accounts, that there was no great change .
 Little difference was detected between the pre-decision and decision phases in Kennedy’s private rhetoric . Little difference in the private rhetoric was detected in Kennedy's private rhetoric.
 Kennedy appeared willing to continue to consider other confrontational options well into the crisis . Although he may have chosen the blockade path, Kennedy seemed willing to look at other options . Kennedy appeared to be willing to consider more confrontational measures .
 This provides provisional support for the Gettysburg thesis . This provides some disconfirming evidence regarding the overconfidence thesis . It is not the first time this has happened since the Civil War .
 The study also provides some insights into the public/private rhetoric debate .
 The absence of significant interaction terms in the ANOVA analysis suggests there may be differences between the actual values of the indices generated using the different types of indices . This echoes Anderson’s findings that the ExCom was still engaged in “decision”-oriented behaviors well into
 Role of Chance 1.0 Universe .6 .9 .5 Estimated Marginal Means .4 .8 .3 Estimated Marginals Means . .7 .1 Public Public Public 0.0 Private .6 Private 1 2 4 1 2 2 4 PHASE P-4 .
 Estimated marginal means, by phase and source of VICS indices, for predictability, control, and role of chance in Kennedy’s beliefs . VICS index is based on phase, source and source .
 This suggests that changes in the VICS scores, rather than the values of the scores themselves, should be the focus of future analyses . The VICS score is a key part of the analysis .
 The context-sensitive nature of the indices means that special attention must be paid to the nature of rhetoric and its source when comparing across individuals or over time . It also suggests that even though private and public statements both can serve as the basis for an examination of belief change using the VICS
 The histories of the crisis suggest that this phase was the most volatile in terms of tactical changes, interaction with the opponents, and possible learning . No utterances were coded in this phase because of the lack of public statements .
 Kennedy had decided on the utility of a diplomatic approach around 24 October, but it was not until later that a trade of missiles was approved . Kennedy decided to trade missiles with the Soviet Union in October .
 The intervening series of letters exchanged between Kennedy and Khrushchev may provide an alternative basis for comparison between types of rhetoric . The intervening period may provide a basis for comparisons .
 Another area that merits further investigation is the role that the president’s interaction with his advisors played in shaping his beliefs . The president's interactions with advisors should be investigated further .
 A considerable portion of the secondary literature on the crisis concerns itself with the nature of group deliberations and the crisis outcome . The crisis outcome is the result of the group deliberations, and the outcome is not known .
 This set of transcripts constitutes the most complete data set available on how an elite group of policymakers arrived at a set of important decisions .
 The integrative complexity of U.S. decision makers in the Cuban missile crisis is discussed .
