 Violators of red lines create fleeting ‘windows of credibility’ wherein violators fear retaliation . Violators are not likely to be punished for violating red lines . Violating red lines creates fleeting 'windows of credibility'
 If declarers move quickly, they can convert non-enforcement into a bargaining chip, exchanging it for concessions while avoiding escalation . Declarations can be turned into bargaining chips for concessions and avoid escalation .
 Rather than wholly embrace clarity or ambiguity, declarers frequently optimize by combin­ ing clear demands with ambiguity about the consequences of crossing those lines . Second, rather than fully embrace clarity, they often optimize by combining ambiguity with clarity .
 Two oversimplified lessons permeate current thinking about red lines . Unfortunately, the lessons are not true, they are, and they are not .
 President Barack Obama declared a red line against the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2012 . In 2012, the United States declared a 'red line' against Syria's use of such weapons .
 Assad regime massacred an estimated 1,400 with sarin gas in August 2013 . He considered bombing regime targets to enforce his red line . The Assad regime was responsible for the massacre .
 President Obama was denied support from Parliament in London and Congress in Washington . He ultimately opted against strikes against strikes .
 His critics alleged that this loss of credibility emboldened U.S. adversaries . Obama's critics said that he lost credibility with the U.N.
 President Obama erred in declaring the Syria red line and failing to enforce it has crystalised as received wisdom . President Obama's failure to enforce the Syrian red line has been accepted as accepted wisdom . Obama has been criticised for not enforcing the red line in Syria .
 To the extent that controversy endures, it concerns whether the mistake was making the statement or failing to follow through on it . The mistake is whether the statement was made or not followed through, CNN.com reports .
 In 1990, United States Ambassador April Glaspie told Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the U.S. had ‘no opinion’ on Iraq’s differences with Kuwait .
 In 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson gave a speech detailing the United States 'defensive perimeter' in Asia . South Korea was excluded from the U.S. ‘Defensive perimeter’ in Asia – a line that excluded South Korea .
 China failed to make sufficiently clear its red line against a U.S. occupation of North Korea, paving the way for war between the United States and China . Several months later, the U.N. and China went to war .
 Creditors say credibility requires clear red lines . Regardless, they contribute to the popular belief that credibility requires declaring red lines, they say .
 The two lessons are at odds over the wisdom of declaring red lines, but they are compatible . The lessons are compatible with each other's lessons on declaring redlines .
 Syria instructs policymakers that they must punish any violations of their red lines or else lose credibility . Syria tells them they must respond to any violation of its red lines .
 The Korean and Gulf Wars teach policymakers that they must clearly and publicly declare their red lines in order to deter aggression, especially when they are truly willing to fight to oppose it .
 The synthesis of these propositions is that leaders should declare clear red lines against actions that will truly provoke retaliation . Leaders should declare red lines, especially against acts that will provoke retaliation, in order to avoid retaliation .
 They should then follow through on those threats after violations while avoiding bluffs that are likely to be called . They should be careful not to make bluffs, especially if they're likely to call .
 This study examines three hypotheses drawn from this conventional wis­ dom and advances arguments to amend each of them . This study is based on the hypothesis of three hypotheses .
 Each argument presents an important and prevalent reason why events deviate from expectations . Although these argu­ ments do not reject the hypotheses outright, they each present an important reason why they deviate .
 Collectively they caution against rotely applying the conventional wisdom to policy decisions . They contribute to a more nuanced understanding of red lines . Collectively, they say that red lines should be considered carefully .
 First, the enforcement hypothesis postulates that when an adversary violates a red line, leaders must aggressively enforce it to sustain the credibility of that red line . Leaders need to aggressively enforce the red line to sustain its credibility, the hypothesis says .
 When an adversary crosses a red line, declarers enter a fleeting window of time in which they retain credibility because their adver­ saries fear imminent retaliation . However, when an adversary . crosses a . red line they enter a brief window of . time when they do so, declare
 Many other cases contributed to popularizing both lessons . By parlaying a willingness to forgo forgo 2, many people have learned a lot from the internet .
 Britain and France are widely thought to have damaged credibility by having committed to defend Czechoslovakia and only to abandon it in Prague’s hour of need .
 3 retaliation as a bargaining chip, opportunistic declarers can take advantage of these ‘windows of credibility’ after violations to convert credible threats to retaliate into concessions – and sometimes to forge deals that end crises .
 Recognizing these opportunities has important implications for crisis management . They provide leaders an alternative ave­ nue to pursue after red line violations besides prompt retaliation or acquiescence .
 The declaration hypothesis holds that leaders must declare red lines for those red lines to be credible . Second, the declaration hypothesis says that leadership must declare a red line for its credibility .
 I follow Thomas Schelling in arguing that declaration is generally superfluous when the red line is set on a saliency that makes it obvious to observers . However, I argue that declaration should be made only when it is in saliency of the line .
 Prominent saliencies include crossing borders, using force, and nuclear use . The saliencies would be crossing borders and using force .
 Red lines against these actions often credible without declaration . Red lines are often credible in the U.S. without declaration.
 The unambiguity hypothesis expects that leaders avoid ambiguous red lines because they undermine credibility . Third, the hypothesis expects leaders to avoid ambiguity because it undermines credibility .
 This reflects one side of a decadesrunning muddle of policy advice about deterrence . Policy about deterrence has been muddled for decades . This reflects a muddle that praises clarity or lauds ambiguity .
 Leaders generally formulate threats that are clear about their red lines but ambiguous about the consequences of crossing those lines . This study explains why leaders tend to make threats ambiguous about what they do .
 This has direct implications for policymakers navigating difficult policy problems such as the level of ambiguity to attach to U.S. deterrence of Chinese aggression against Taiwan . This has implications for policy decisions such as how to respond to China's threat to Taiwan .
 The research design works within the limits of what case studies can reveal about general theories . The research is based on case studies that have been published in the past .
 Case studies are comparatively ill-suited to answering probabil­­ istic questions about explanatory power, such as how much failing to enforce a red line after a violation damages credibility .
 Case studies stand on firmer ground when they explore causal processes . In contrast, case studies are more likely to focus on causal processes rather than causal ones . Case studies can be useful to understand how causal processes work .
 "This study relies primarily on one application of that broader approach," says author of the study .
 Case studies can contribute by showing that actors repeatedly identified and selected a third option, one whose existence and appeal requires revisiting the logic of the theory . For theories that assume actors make constrained choices between two policy options, case studies can help .
 It combines theory-testing and theory-building by revealing when and why causal processes divert from the expected sequence . Within that umbrella, it combines theory testing and theory building .
 Process-Tracing Methods: Foundations and Guidelines . Derek Beach and Rasmus B Pedersen, Rasmus A. Pedersen . Process-tracing methods were developed by the University of Cambridge .
 President Kennedy held the potential for a military response in abeyance, exploiting Soviet fears to press for concessions . President Kennedy exploited Soviet fears in Cuba to push for concessions to avoid military action .
 He used this tactic again when the Soviet Union shot down an American U-2 over Cuba . He used it again when he used it to shoot down a U.2 in Cuba .
 Restraining from a military response became a bargaining chip that helped forge the deal that ended the crisis . Restraining the military response was a key bargaining chip to end the crisis in Iraq .
 Kennedy’s five initial red lines – those against Soviet bases and organized combat forces in Cuba – quickly faded to the background . Two of Kennedy's five initial . red lines - those against . Soviet bases - quickly faded into the background.
 Washington allowed certain Soviet-bloc ships and submarines to transgress the blockade line and suffered no apparent credibility loss . Further challen­ ging the belief that red lines must be enforced to the letter .
 The Soviet Union did not declare a crucial red line against attacking Soviet troops in Cuba, whose existence was denied . The existence of the red line was not declared, but Moscow denied it .
 Washington committed to the Pentagon that it would retaliate if the Soviet Union shot down a U.S. surveillance aircraft, but not to the Soviets . Washington committed . It would retaliate .
 All but one red line set during the crisis by either side combined clarity about the red line itself with ambiguity about the consequences of crossing it .
 The exceptional array of declassified documents available from the U.S. and, albeit a lesser extent, the Soviet Union, makes this study possible .
 Caution is always warranted when seeking to generalize from a single case . Nonetheless, caution is always needed when seeking the generalization from one case .
 It seeks to use this important case to shed light on contemporary theoretical controversies and policy debates . The case is not only a case but a case sheds light on theoretical controversies .
 Leaders confronted with a crisis often cannot swiftly improve the balance of power or forge new alliances . But one policy tool leaders always have is immediately available is rhetoric .
 Decisions about what, if anything, to say stand as a virtually universal feature of conflicts that approach the brink of war . Decisions on what to say are virtually universal features of conflicts .
 Fear of nuclear war could lead policymakers to declare fewer or more ambiguous red lines . In calmer times, states formulate declaratory policies that set the stage for war .
 5 for future conflicts, often by establishing verbal and legal commitments to defend an ally or interest . The U.S. has a long history of foreign policy and foreign policy .
 The impact of verbal statements articulating red lines is the subject of question throughout this study . Policy makers dedicate to crafting their red lines even on the brink of nuclear war underscores their importance .
 Red lines are policy tools meant to influence – usually to constrain – the actions of an adversary . Red lines can be used to influence and constrain actions of a foreign policymaker .
 Each demand, in turn, must contain a red line to distinguish what is demanded from what is not . Each demand must be met with a different red line .
 A coercer conveys the intent to carry out its threat for unacceptable actions that cross the red line, but not for acceptable actions that fall short of it . A coercion can be carried out for unacceptable behavior that crosses the line, not acceptable actions .
 By this definition, red lines are an inherent part of all coercive demands . Red lines are both deterrent threats that aim to sustain the status quo and compellent threats that demand changes to it .
 Leaders found ample language for articulat­ ing red lines before the phrase came into vogue . Leaders found it easy to communicate red lines in the past .
 The definition does not require that red lines be publicly or verbally declared . Red lines are not required to be declared in public or publicly .
 Leaders can convey red lines implicitly, tacitly, privately, privately and ambiguously . Leaders can communicate red lines tacitly and tacitly . Red lines can be communicated implicitly or tacitly by leaders .
 This allows for the important possibi­ lity of undeclared red lines that are nonetheless mutually understood . This allows us to make clear red lines between us and others .
 The study investigates threats and coercion as much as red lines, using the term facilitates discussion of both enforcement and ambiguity . Using the term "red lines" helps discussion of the issue of law enforcement and enforcement .
 One can more easily speak of limited violations of red lines than of threats, which is important for analyzing decisions concerning enforcement . One can speak of only violations of the red lines, which are important to analyze .
 Discussion of undeclared red lines is also clearer than it would be for unde-declared threats, if only because many established definitions of coercive threats define threats by requiring explicit declaration .
 If a leader fails to impose the threatened conse­ quences after a violation, that leader loses credibility for subsequent encounters and domestic political standing . A leader must impose a threat after a breach of the law, a leader says .
 Leaders worry about the per­ ceptions of allies, adversaries, neutrals, and their own publics . They worry about allies and adversaries, allies, and the publics, too . Leaders worry that they will have to deal with their own people .
 Of course, threatened consequences are not always imposed; bluffs qualify as coercion . Bluffs are bluffs that threaten consequences are coercion . These reputa­ tional concerns and audience costs render verbal statements such as red 10 .
 When a leader clearly and publicly declares a red line, that red line gains credibility, it gains credibility . Consequently, 2) when a leader publicly declares that a person has committed suicide, that person's credibility gains credibility. 2) When a person commits suicide in a suicide attack, that
 Clear red lines are thought to magnify both effects of ambiguous red lines . Clear lines are more effective than ambiguous lines, according to scientists .
 The enforcement hypothesis is the implicit basis for much of the criticism directed at President Obama for his decision not to strike in Syria . Obama's decision to strike Syria in Syria has been widely criticized .
 It expects that allowing a violation of a declared red line to go unpunished damages the subsequent credibility of that red line . The U.S. government says it expects that .
 It may further damage the credibility of the leader who declared it and perhaps even the declarer state,15 but the focus here is on the violated red line itself .
 In practical terms, this hypothesis counsels policymakers that they must treat their red lines as inviolable, strictly enforcing them after violations . Policymakers must treat these red lines with respect to their own red lines, and enforce them .
 A state declares a red line, then fails to enforce it after a first violation . A state must enforce it if it violates it first, then enforce it again .
 By allowing the first offense to pass, the declarer reveals an unwill­ ingness to enforce the red line . The declarer shows that he is not willing to enforce it .
 Survey experiments consistently find that the American public disap­ proves of a President who pledges to intervene to stop an aggressor but fails to follow through . Survey experiments show that the U.S. public disapp­ proves that a President .
 Case studies, by contrast, have yielded mixed conclusions . Case studies have also yielded mixed results, experts say .
 Publics judge leaders based on policies and outcomes regardless of the content of their verbal statements . They argue that publics judge politicians based on policy outcomes .
 Early studies of reputation concluded that backing down in crises did not critically damage leaders or states’ cred­ ibility in future encounters . Early studies found backing down did not damage leaders’ credibility .
 Even reputation skeptics might concede that failing to enforce a specific red line after a first violation would undercut the credibility of threats to enforce that same red line upon the next violation .
 President Obama decided not to enforce his 2012 red line by striking the Assad regime . McCain later attributed Russia's invasion of Crimea to the weakness President Obama revealed in Syria .
 Even many Democrats agreed that President Obama damaged his own credibility by deciding against airstrikes in Syria . Obama damaged himself and perhaps the nation’s credibility by choosing not to attack .
 Jim Jones, Obama’s National Security Advisor until 2010, later called the Syria red line a ‘colossal mistake’ Let us stipulate that unpunished violations undermine credibility eventually .
 In the immediate aftermath of a violation before a response crystallizes, violators fear punishment . Nonetheless, in the . immediate aftermath, the . aftermath of the violation before . a . response crystallized, violator fears punishment .
 After all, a child most fears her parents’ wrath immediately after they glimpse her hand in the cookie jar . After all the most feared her parents' wrath was when she was caught up with her parents .
 The absence of immediate enforcement is consistent with acquiescence but, crucially, also with preparing to retaliate . It is also likely that the government is preparing to take action against the Taliban .
 Leaders can use that time to attempt other policy options besides immediate retaliation . Leaders can try other options, such as trying to avoid immediate retaliation.
 In this period, the violator keenly understands that the declarer now confronts significant incentives to punish them and/or to attempt to reverse the violation . The violator is aware of the fact that it is likely to be punished for a violation of the law .
 Post-violation incentives emerge from the harm done by the violation, concerns about international reputation, domestic audience costs, and the strategic logic of tit-for-tat reciprocity .
 The length of each window of credibility depends on the circumstances – specifically, the length of time needed to fully prepare (militarily, diplomati­ cally, and politically) to enforce the red line .
 Once the violator perceives that preparations have stalled or reached completion without enforcement occur­ ring, credibility loss begins . The violator may face credibility loss if it fails to enforce the law .
 Because violators cannot exactly know the length of time required to prepare an enforcement response, this credibility loss is typically incremental . Violators cannot know how long it will take to prepare for enforcement response .
 Some declarers react to violations by retaliating . Others harness the aftermath of a violation as a window of opportunity to press the violator for concessions .
 They convert restraining from enforcement into a bargaining chip, then trade it for something of value . Implicitly or explicitly, they turn restraining into an opportunity to use it for value .
 Describing President Obama’s Syria policy as a decision not to enforce his red line is an oversimplification . Describing the Syria response as a ‘red line’ is an over-simply oversimplified .
 President Obama leveraged what remained of his post-violation credibility to pressure the Assad regime into a Russian-brokered deal . After the U.S. Congress declined to back the use of force, he instead leveraged his credibility . The deal was reached by Russia and Russia,
 The regime osten­ sibly gave up its chemical weapons in return for non-retaliation for their violation . The U.S. gave up their chemical weapons to the regime in a deal with the U.K. regime .
 Assad’s decision to take this deal reflected the residual credibility of the U.S. threat to punish Syria, Assad says . Assad: “Assad's decision reflects a residual credibility’ of the United States,” he says .
 Credibility is the target’s perception of the probability that the coercer will carry out the threat after a violation . Tragically, Assad relinquished only a substantial part of his chemical weapons arsenal, later using chemical weapons .
 Reputation encompasses longer-term views about an actor with implications for the credibility of all of that actor’s threats . Reputation is a long-term view of an actor's reputation, which can affect his credibility .
 The discussion focuses on immediate credibility for simplicity’s sake and for consistency with the analysis of a single crisis . The discussion of immediate credibility focuses on the crisis for simplicity .
 In effect, the violator accepts creating incentives to retaliate as the price for reaping the benefits of the violation . In effect it creates incentives to punish people who commit a crime .
 Violator may hope that declarer’s response will be eventual non-enforcement, but opportunistic pressure by the declarer shortly after the violation may nonetheless lead the violator to grant concessions . The violator may . hope that the . response to the . violator’
 The destruction of significant quantities of Syrian weapons of mass destruction was a substantive conces­ sion, quite possibly more than airstrikes could have achieved . Nonetheless, the destruction was significant, and it was more effective than airstrikes .
 Leveraging a window of credibility to forge a coercive bargain is not a guarantee against credibility loss . President Obama's criticism of President Obama over non-enforcement in Syria suggests .
 Perceptions will depend on the value of the concessions received in return for non-enforcement, among other factors . Perceptions of those concessions will vary depending on the amount of concessions .
 The Assad regime’s subsequent use of chemical weapons revealed the limits of the concessions it made, the author says . And indeed, the Assad regime used chemical weapons in Syria .
 It's reasonable to postulate that observers will typically judge non-enforcement with meaningful concessions more favorably than without them . Nonetheless, it is reasonable to think that observers may judge enforcement with meaningful concession more favorably .
 President Kennedy used similar tactics with greater success . As will be discussed, President Kennedy tried to use similar tactics . President Kennedy's tactics were successful in the 1960s .
 Like in Syria, exploiting a window of credibility achieved concessions while avoiding escalation . Like in the Syrian case, exploiting in Syria has achieved concessions, avoid escalation .
 The declaration hypothesis proposes that publicly declaring a red line is necessary for that red line to be credible in the eyes of the adversary . It proposes that public declaration is necessary to make it credible .
 The distinction is between publicly declared red lines and those left unsaid, either because no threat was made, or because the threat was conveyed implicitly or tacitly, is between the two .
 States have a clear incentive to appear resolute so that the adversary will back down . States have an incentive to be resolute, so they can appear to back down, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Confessing low resolve by declining to declare a red line gives away the game without playing . Confessing a low resolve is a way of avoiding playing, it's not a way out of the game, it says .
 If leaders will not even say aloud that they are willing to fight for something, the declaration hypothesis doubts that adversaries will believe they are truly willing to do so .
 McManus analyses large collections of U.S. government statements and finds that statements of resolve affect diplomatic outcomes, particularly in the absence of military and domestic political constraints .

 Two studies find that private communica­ tions more often affect perceptions than public statements . However, two studies find private statements more often impact perceptions than statements .
 Historians have raised doubts about the significance of those non-declarations . History has raised doubts over the significance .
 Pyongyang began request­ ing Moscow’s support for an invasion before Dean Acheson’�s speech leaving South Korea outside the U.S. ‘defensive perimeter’ so the speech did not cause the intention to invade . North Korea began requesting support from Moscow
 Well-placed Soviet spies furn­ ished more reliable sources of information to Moscow . The Soviets were well-placed sources of intelligence to Moscow, sources say .
 Stalin remained concerned about potential U.S. intervention despite the speech . Stalin remained con­ cernerned about potential United States intervention .
 United States Ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie stated only that the U.S. had ‘no opinion’ on Iraq’s ‘border disagreement with Kuwait’ in her July 1990 conversation with Saddam Hussein .
 She meant that the United States sought a peaceful settlement but was agnostic about the content of that deal . She said the U.S. sought peaceful settlement, but was not concerned about content of it .
 Hussein clearly stated his intention to pursue multi-round negotiations with Kuwait . Hussein said he would be willing to take part in the negotiations with the country .
 He gave Glaspie no indication of war that would have prompted her to scuttle the meeting by overtly threatening him .
 Iraqi documents suggest that – far from perceiving a green light – Baghdad perceived the United States as implacably hostile and expected a U.S. response . Iraqi documents show that Baghdad perceives the U.N. response as a response to the threat .
 Both the Korean and Gulf War precedents seem to underscore the damage that non-declaration inflicts on credibility .
 The evidence presented below will show that undeclared red lines can be surprisingly credible . However, the evidence will also show that the evidence presented will be surprising .
 I follow Schelling in arguing that red lines are obvious to adversaries without needing declaration when a violation would transgress established saliencies, especially those against using force, crossing borders, and using nuclear weapons .
 South Korea need not communicate to North Korea that it must not invade across the Demilitarized Zone for Pyongyang to appreciate the credibility of that red line . That is, South Korea needs not to communicate to N. Korea that North Korea must not .
 These saliencies can render declaration irrele­ vant by making implicit red lines apparent to adversaries . The saliencies are saliencies that make declaration irreverently clear to adversaries, such as Russia .
 I argue that declaration is often superfluous when a red line is set on one of these saliencies . I argue it often seems superfluous to set a limit on how much a person can get away from it .
 To illustrate why this matters, the Korea example is again useful . The Korea example was again useful. To illustrate this, the Korean example is useful.
 Station tens of thousands of American soldiers in South Korea, obscure their numbers, and refer to them only as advisors . Station thousands of U.S. soldiers in the region .
 Demand that North Korea not invade but fail to specify clear consequences . U.S. should not invade North Korea but should not be allowed to do so again .
 This deterrent posture would fall outside the boundaries of current policy debates in Washington, D.C. says .
 It is inimical to common assumptions about the importance of declaratory policy for deterrence, it is said . It is also inimistic to the notion that it is necessary to have a clear policy on deterrence .
 This is essentially what the Soviet Union did in Cuba . Yet, strange as it may seem, this is exactly what it did in the country .
 The unde-declared Soviet red line against attacking their troops in Cuba was credible to President Kennedy . President Kennedy believed the line was credible .
 The unambiguity hypothesis expects that leaders avoid ambiguous red lines because they undermine credibility . The unambiguous red line is a red line that leaders must avoid .
 Precise red lines are thought to increase the reputational and audience costs of not enforcing them . They tie leaders’ hands and lend their threats greater credibility, experts say .
 By calibrating the level of ambi­ guity, leaders can attempt to optimize the degree to which they tie their hands . Leaders can also try to optimize how much they tie themselves up with people .
 Audience cost critics reject this hypothesis and conclude that leaders consistently opt for ambiguity to preserve their freedom of action in order to reduce the risk of unwanted escalation . Leaders often choose ambiguity to protect their freedom to take risks of escalation .
 Leaders differ on which side of that tradeoff tends to outweigh the other . Leaders generally select between the two sides of the tradeoff .
 I posit that ambiguity about where the line is drawn damages credibility more than ambiguity about what happens if it is crossed . E.g., Schelling, Arms and Influence .
 No blanket claim about ambiguity being beneficial, detrimental, com­ mon, or rare can capture the full picture . Because the two function differ­ ently, there is no blanket claim that ambiguity is beneficial or detrimental, it can't be true .
 U.S. President Barack Obama declared in 2014, ‘There will be costs’ for a Russian military intervention in the Crimean Peninsula .
 Obama was relatively clear about the red line – what action was prohibited – but considerably more ambiguous about the punishment for a violation . Obama was less clear about what action should be prohibited, but said it would be punished .
 The North Atlantic Treaty Association charter is surprisingly vague about consequences . Even the language of the charter is vague about the consequences of the treaty .
 First, telegraphing the exact form of a punitive strike allows the adversary to take countermeasures to defeat it, blunt its impact, or prepare a riposte . Telegraping the exact amount of a strike allows an adversary to countermeasures .
 Threats that specify exact consequences for violations are often at odds with the strategic and policy processes with which states respond to violations . Second, threats that specify specific consequences for violation often conflict with the policy process with which state responds to violations, experts say .
 The nature, extent, and context of a violation influence the response . The nature of the violation is determined by the severity of the offense .
 The windows of credibility discussed previously happen amid this period of flux immediately after violations . The window of credibility previously discussed previously happens during the period of credibility .
 In the case of Syria, the size of any punish­ ment might have depended on the quantity of chemical weapons used, the number of people killed, and the responses of other states .
 Under such circumstances, threatening a specific, fixed response to a violation is impractical . Threatening a specific response to such a breach is impractical, police say .
 Tertrais distinguishes these two types of ambiguity but argues only that it is best to avoid both at once . He argues that it's better to avoid ambiguity in both cases .
 McManus classifies statements of resolve that refer to consequences as stronger by a tier than statements that merely articulate demands . He classifies such statements as stronger than those that simply articulate demands as stronger .
 Snyder and Borghard discuss both types of ambiguity together and make the same claims about both . Snyder: "There is no ambiguity in both cases"
 Only ambiguity about demands creates specific gray areas that provide openings for the adversary to advance with reduced fear of consequences, often via ‘grey zone’ tactics .
 To borrow an example from Schelling, threatening to ground a child for a week if he enters the water will leave the parent in a bind when the initial violation is merely feet in the water (clear punishment; gray area in red line) In contrast, demanding that the child not put
 My claim that ambiguous red lines function as green lights is antithetical to a popular argument about the virtues of ambiguity . Importantly, my claim that . ambiguous red line function as . green lights does not reflect a popular . argument about ambiguity .
 This argument posits that ambiguity engenders uncertainty about exactly what will trigger retribution, thus promoting caution . This argument is based on the idea that ambiguity is ambiguous and therefore leads to caution .
 Clarity functions as a green light that encourages the adversary to advance up to the line . Correspondingly, clarity is said to function as a 'green light' to encourage the adversary .
 Decision between leaving some­ thing outside a red line and leaving it ambiguous is a false choice . That logic seems compelling, but it's not compelling .
 The argument is that yellow lights better deter drivers from entering intersections than green lights . By analogy, yellow lights are better deterring drivers from using green lights than yellow ones .
 Ambiguity appears the more constraining of the two only because the third option, a red light, has been excluded from the option . The third option is the option with the option of red light being excluded .
 States always retain the option to display a red light, i.e. to draw a clear line such that the adversary cannot advance before reaching it . Yet states still retain the . option to show a clear red light .
 There are good reasons to expect leaders to gravitate toward clarity about their red lines . Leaders will gravitate to ambiguity about the consequences of cross­ ing .
 Future studies might better assess whether this combination truly outperforms the alternatives .
 Both sides adopted it so consistently, the variation to draw inferences about effectiveness is lacking in the Cuba case . Because both sides used it so frequently, it's not possible to infer effectiveness, experts say .
 Both the United States and the Soviet Union – two rather different regimes – shared this predilection . Nonetheless, the fact that both the U.S. and the . Soviet . governments – both rather different – is reason to suppose that leaders frequently settle upon declaring red lines .
 47% of sanctions threats were specific about consequences, compared to 47% that were specific . In comparison, 47% were specific to specific consequences .
 President Kennedy let smaller Soviet violations of two of his five initial red lines pass without enforcement . President Kennedy's first blockade line passed without enforcement, he says .
 Throughout the crisis, he avoided any admission that he would not use force to enforce his red lines in Cuba in order to exploit Soviet fears about his response to their violations .
 Washington doubled down on this tactic after the shootdown of an American U-2 . The U.2 was shot down by the U.S. Air Force in 2009 .
 Attorney General Robert Kennedy leveraged the threat to make the deal that removed Soviet missiles from Cuba . The deal also included a concession to remove missiles from Turkey, along with the secret concession .
 Each side chose not to declare a vital red line that nonetheless proved credible to the other . With respect to the declaration hypothesis, each side chose to ignore the red line .
 Soviet leaders never publicly declared a red line against attacking Soviet forces in Cuba . Their presence in Cuba was denied by Soviet leaders .
 The undeclared Soviet red line against attacking those troops was credible anyway anyway anyway . It was a credible red line for attacking Soviet troops .
 Washington never declared a red line against firing on its surveillance aircraft over Cuba . The U.S. has been watching Cuba for years .
 Khrushchev rightly reacted with dread upon learning that Soviet forces shot down a U-2 without orders from Moscow . Yet he was right to react with dread when he learned of the incident . The incident occurred in the early 1960s .
 With respect to the unambiguity hypothesis, all but one red line that either side declared during the crisis combined clarity about demands and ambi­ guity about consequences .
 The subsequent discussion provides the basis for the determina­ tions in the tables . The discussion is based on the findings of the study .
 For Kennedy’s initial red lines, it is possible to trace how his initial language featuring ambiguous demands and clear consequences reversed course on both counts as he and his advisors crafted his statement .
 President Kennedy declared a red line against Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba on 4 September 1962 . Kennedy was seeking to deflect criticism after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion .
 A red line is considered credible if the target of the threat believes that violation will more likely than not lead the coercer to use force . Red lines are considered credible by a target of a threat who believes violation will lead to force .
 Cuban forces might be limited in nature and need not involve nuclear weapons . Ground missiles or other significant offensive capability may be in Cuban hands or under Soviet direction and guidance .
 Kennedy personally read the statement to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on 18 October . Kennedy read it out to Soviet foreign minister Gromko .
 W C, ‘Cable on the Conversation between Gromyko and Kennedy’, 18 October 1962. ‘Gromyko’s ‘conversational’ with Kennedy. W C. W. C. was a member of the Cabinet .
 Alongside the missiles and nuclear-capable IL-28 medium bombers, the Soviets established bases and deployed 41,000 troops, though the full extent of that deployment was unknown at the time .
 The U.S. did not aggressively pursue demands other than removal of missiles and IL-28s . The United States did not pursue such demands .
 President Kennedy instead decided to allow the non-nuclear violations in implicit exchange for Soviet compliance with higher-priority demands . President Kennedy decided to let the violations go in exchange for higher priority demands . Kennedy: "It was a mistake"
 Kennedy set aside two of his nuclear red lines after their violation without any apparent loss of credibility . The greater importance of the nuclear red line explains public acceptance of that decision .
 Both U.S. and available Soviet documents from the crisis and aftermath largely fail to mention it . This tacit acquiescence did not figure significantly into Soviet perceptions or create concerns about credibility loss .
 This conflicts with a rigid belief that red lines must always be enforced to the letter . This is not always the case, it is not the case that the government must always enforce the letter, it says .
 A Joint Staff memo written two weeks after the crisis subsided said: ‘No one will record the Cuba episode as a victory of even modest proportions for the United States if the end result is a substantial Soviet military presence in the hemisphere'
 It recommended using the blockade as leverage to force out Soviet troops . The blockade was recommended using using it to force Soviet troops out .
 The memo failed to mention that President Kennedy had publicly committed to that red line . Curiously, however, the memo didn't mention that .
 The 4 September statement not only included the prohibitions against Soviet organized combat forces and bases in Cuba; it began with them . The statement also included the prohibition against Soviet combat forces in Cuba .
 By 14 November the exact words Kennedy used on 4 September had lost their importance . Nonetheless, by that time, the words had become less important .
 The Soviet Union eventually did remove most of its troop presence from Cuba . It will continue to be so confined .
 The U.S. withdrew from Cuba in 2009 after a series of threats from Castro Castro . That withdrawal owed more to the souring of relations with Castro than United States threats . The withdrawal was due to souring relations with the Castro regime .
 The decision to specify ground-to-ground missiles left Khrushchev in a weaker position from which to make that argument from which he made that argument . The decision was made by the Soviet Union in 1962 .
 In general, that line should be drawn at the installation in Cuba or in Cuban Waters of nuclear weapons or delivery vehicles, sea or land based .
 This largely describes the resultant statement, except with respect to specify military consequences . This is not the case for military action, but it is a matter of principle .
 The decision, instead, was for clarity about demands but ambiguity about consequences . The decision was made for clarity, not ambiguity, but for clarity .
 President Kennedy reiterated the U.S. position on 13 September .
 Even after removing background noise with the software Audacity, I was not certain of my ability to recognize voices besides Kennedy’s from the poor-quality tape; hence the lack of specificity about advisors’ identities .
 The strategy depended greatly on context that would have been difficult to anticipate, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 U.S. policy was shaped by Washington’s detection of the missiles in the brief period after they arrived in Cuba but not operational .
 Kennedy’s five red lines could have been violated in any of dozens of combinations, each to various extents . Kennedy's red lines were likely violated in dozens of ways .
 Moscow succeeded, at least for thirteen days, at deterring Washington from attacking Cuba . Moscow succeeded in deterring U.S. from attacking Havana .
 Soviet Union declared a red line against attacking the Cubans but declined to do so for its own forces in Cuba . The Soviet Union declined to attack the Cuban people .
 President Kennedy and most of his advisors perceived the undeclared Soviet red line against attacking Soviet troops as credible and indeed as significantly more credible than the declared red line for attacking Cubans .
 The Soviet Union did not fear killing Cubans, despite the declared Soviet red line against doing so . That is, despite a declared red line, the Soviet government did not want to kill Cubans .
 Officials feared killing Soviet troops in Cuba, despite official Soviet position that such troops did not exist and so could not be killed . But they did fear killing Soviet forces in Cuba .
 The physical reality of attacking Soviet soldiers and missiles took precedence over the Soviet rhetorical stance . Soviet soldiers were attacked by Soviet missiles and missiles in the 1980s .
 The Soviet Union has the possibility from its own territory to render assistance to any peace-loving state, not only Cuba . We have said and we do repeat that if war is unleashed, if the aggressor makes an attack on one state or another and this state asks for assistance, the
 "If this attack is made, this will be the beginning of the unleashing of war," he said . If this attack was made, it would be the 'beginning of war'
 Taking both selections together, the Soviet Union declared a red line that made clear the demand not to attack Cuba . The Soviet Union made clear that it would not attack Cuba in Cuba .
 A U.S. attack against Cuba would trigger a Soviet attack, nuclear or otherwise, against the United States . However, the convoluted prose never plainly stated that a United States. attack on Cuba would. trigger a . Soviet attack .
 Moscow has used vague and ambiguous language to avoid clear-cut obligation of military support in event of attack . Moscow has once again used vague . vague and . ambiguous language . Moscow uses vague . and ambiguous . language . Russia has not responded to any threat of attack, says Russian President Vladimir
 The declaration hypothesis expects that the Soviet red line against attacking Soviet troops should lack credibility because it was not declared . The hypothesis is that the declaration of the red line should be considered a credibility problem .
 President Kennedy and most of his advisors feared the consequences of cross­ ing this undeclared line . However, President Kennedy feared consequences of crossing the line .
 Consequences of action by the U.S. will be the inevitable “spilling of blood” of Soviet military personnel, says Mikhail Gorchkov . Gorchov: Consequence of action will be inevitable ‘spilling blood’ of Soviet personnel .
 He emphasized Soviet casualties, the costs of the Soviet response, and the difficulties of controlling subsequent events . He emphasized the costs and difficulties of Soviet response .
 According to the declaration hypothesis, Soviet non-declaration left a fatal weakness in its deterrent posture . The hypothesis is based on the theory that the Soviet Union did not declare itself as a state of war .
 The United States could strike Cuba while denying that it had attacked the Soviet Union . The U.S. could also deny that it attacked the USSR . Cuba could be hit by the United States while denying it attacked Russia .
 The Soviets have no public treaty with Cuba and have not acknowledged that Soviet bases are on the Island . Cuba has no treaty with the U.S. and has not acknowledged Soviet bases .
 This situation provides them with a pretext for treating U.S. military action against Cuba as an affair which does not directly involve them, writes CNN.com's Peter Bergen .
 Hawks in Washington repeatedly raised this proposal to use Soviet nondeclaration as an opportunity to strike . Hawks said it could be used as a way to strike in the Soviet Union .
 Kennedy rejected this approach on multiple occasions because he feared that a strike would cause war, Soviet rhetoric notwithstanding . Kennedy rejected the approach because of the threat of a strike, despite the rhetoric .
 Soviet Reactions to Certain U.S. Courses of Action on Cuba’, 19 October 1962 . ‘Cuba’ was the Cuban government’s response to the Cuban crisis in 1962 .
 Khrushchev's thinking began with a clear appreciation of the vulnerability he created, in line with the declaration hypothesis’s expectations about the dangers of non-declaration . The declaration hypothesis is based on the declaration theory of the danger of not declaring .
 Khrushchev anticipated the gambit that hawks in Washington thought they could use to strike without Soviet retaliation . Washington thought it could strike without retaliation from the Soviet Union . The U.S. went to war with the Soviets in the 1960s .
 He left the vulnerability in place for several more crucial days rather than release a press statement . He left it in place until the end of the day .
 'They can attack, and we will respond,' the president said . The reason seems evident, ‘ . . . the reason seems obvious,’ he said . ‘. They can attack and they will respond,” the president wrote .
 Khrushchev concluded that the U.S. would fear attacking Soviet troops in Cuba . Despite the lack of a declared Soviet red line, the United States would not attack Soviet troops .
 Other Soviet leaders shared his view that declaration was unnecessary for the Soviet Union to be committed to retaliate for an attack on its troops in Cuba .
 Khrushchev’s choice not to declare strongly suggests that he saw the deterrence benefit of declaring the troops’ presence as smaller than the propaganda value of continuing to deny it . If an invasion on the part of the Americans began, it would have led to a global confrontation�
 It is revealing that Soviet denials persisted even after the U.S. discovered and announced the presence of the missiles in Cuba . The Soviet Union still denied the existence of the missile missiles .
 Forgoing the credibility boost of public declaration is easier to explain away as a Soviet attempt to deploy the missiles secretly as a fait accompli . Forgoing a credibility boost is easier than explaining away as the missiles were deployed as a secret .
 Castro proposed publicizing a treaty of alliance between the Soviet Union and Cuba might suffice to protect Cuba . Khrushchev demurred because he preferred to deploy missiles in secret .
 He planned to announce the missiles in November after the U.S. midterm elections . The missiles will be announced in November .
 The persistence of Soviet denials after all hopes for secrecy died on 22 October reveals the Soviet Union valued the propaganda value of continuing to deny the missiles’ existence over the deterrence value of declaring a red line to protect them .
 Khrushchev could have announced the large-scale pre­ sence of Soviet troops and missiles in Cuba on 23 October . He could have pledged to defend Cuba as an ally .
 U.S. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson unveiled photographs of the missiles at the United Nations on 25 October . He did not do so even after the U.N. ambassador unveiled photos of missiles in October .
 Soviet stonewalling about the presence of missiles only began to wane on 26 October . Stonewalling only began when the Soviet Union began to admit the existence of missiles .
 He edged toward articulating a red line against attacking Soviet troops in Cuba . ‘ . . . e are of sound mind and understand perfectly well that if we attack you, you will respond the same way,' he said .
 Khrushchev: 'I think that you also understand this’ The language evinces Khrushvic’s assumption that declaration was superfluous. And I think that . you understand this,’’
 Public perceptions of Soviet denials persisted until the last full day of the crisis . Public perceptions continued to persist until the end of the war .
 Khrushchev unambiguously acknowledged the presence of the missiles in a 27 October letter to Kennedy . The letter was intended to facilitate a deal and reassure Washington that Soviet officers – not Cubans – controlled the missiles .
 Soviet red lines against attacking Cuba paint a two-part picture . Overall, Soviet red line on attacking Cuba paints a two part of the picture .
 Khrushchev and hawks in Washington clearly understood the incentives captured in the declaration hypothesis . Both were well aware of the incentives of the declaration .
 Khrushchev deemed the advantages of declaration less valuable than secrecy and, after that collapsed, propaganda . The advantages of declaring declared were less important than secrecy .
 Khrushchev chose to forgo declaring his red line until the last full day of the crisis . He believed the U.S. would hesitate before attacking Soviet forces regardless .
 President Kennedy went public on 22 October with the discovery of Soviet missiles and his decision to ‘quarantine’ Cuba . After a tense week of deliberations, he went public with the decision to quarantine Cuba .
 Referring to the blockade as a quarantine allowed the U.S. to maintain a patina of legality over what would otherwise constitute an act of war . Referring it to a quarantine was a move that would otherwise have constituted war .
 Kennedy held the potential use of force in abeyance, using it as coercive leverage during the window of credibility before the Soviet Union gained confidence that he would not strike . Instead, Kennedy used it as a coercive leverage .
 Although a significant signal of resolve, the blockade could not itself remove the missiles . The blockade is a significant statement of resolve but it could not remove missiles .
 It served a broader strategy of coercion predicated on the possibility that more enforcement was to come, capitalizing on a window of credibility . The U.S. government says it has a "window of credibility" in the region .
 The demand to remove the missiles first appears midway through the speech . The demand for removal of the missiles was first made by President Obama .
 One easily overlooked drawback of the blockade was that it gave Moscow the opportunity to correct its mistake . Moscow declared a clear red line against attacking Soviet forces in Cuba .
 President Kennedy said Kennedy said he couldn't announce that in four days from now you’re going to take them out . Kennedy: ‘ . . . obviously you can’t sort of sort of announce that . in . four days . from now, ‘Obviously you
 Kennedy reiterated this fear five days later in the lead-up to his speech . Kennedy reiterated it five days before his speech in Washington .
 Washington preferred that the Soviet leaders never had a chance to tie their hands with a public red line . Consistent with the declaration hypothesis, Washington preferred to tie them up with the line .
 Kennedy accepted that exact risk by selecting the blockade option . Nonetheless, Kennedy accepted the same risk by choosing to blockade .
 In deciding how to enforce the 4 September red lines, the White House took seriously the domestic and international consequences of inaction . The White House says it is taking seriously the risks of inaction.
 Kennedy ruminated after learning of the missiles, ‘My press statement was so clear about how we wouldn’t do anything under these conditions,' he said .
 'Kennedy took seriously the consequences of failing to enforce a red line. 23 which we had made publicly at that time’
 Soviet leaders also contemplated the possibility that Kennedy’s public state­ ments would tie his hands . Soviet leaders considered the possibility of tying Kennedy's hands .
 Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin wrote to Moscow, A certain danger of the situation is that the President has largely engaged himself before the public opinion of America and not only America, he wrote .
 In essence, he has put at stake his reputation as a statesman and politician, and thus his prospects for re-election in 1964, what–being an ambitious man–he passionately seeks .
 This is not possible to exclude completely the possi­ bility that he can undertake such an adventurist step as an invasion of Cuba . This is why it is not excluded completely the possibility that he could, especially taking into consideration his circle, he says .
 This remarkable step-by-step explication of audience costs theory provides a measure of support for the declaration hypothesis . This is a remarkable step by-step explanation .
 The atmosphere in the Kremlin grew tense as senior Soviet officials stayed up past midnight to learn what Washington would do . The severity of events ‘obviously have overtaken the significance of electoral considerations,’ Dobrynin wrote .
 The declara­ tion hypothesis envisions that a public statement such a statement such as Kennedy’s gen­ erates credibility by tying hands . The declar­ tion theory is that public statements such as this tie hands with credibility .
 The immediate reaction of Soviet leaders to Kennedy’s speech was a sense of relief, says historian John Sutter .
 The choice for coercive diplomacy and blockade was a choice not to bomb or invade Cuba, at least not initially . The U.S. made a similar decision not to invade Cuba initially, not initially, in Cuba .
 Soviet fears spiked with the dis­ covery of the missiles, which revealed the violation of Kennedy’s red lines . Those fears eased with the announcement of Kennedy's brinkmanship policy .
 The basic threat itself – that the United States would retaliate after a Soviet first strike with nuclear weapons – merely reprised the logic of Cold War deterrence . The U.S. would retaliate with a first strike against the Soviet Union in the Cold War .
 Kennedy’s red lines with respect to the blockade and removal of the removal of missiles required rapid resolutions to avert escalation . The Soviet Government is taking all necessary measures for preventing our country .
 Washington and Moscow’s focus on those red lines becomes easier to understand . Russia and the U.S. have been at odds with each other for years .
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk’s reaction to Soviet ships halting short of the blockade line remains a signature phrase in the public memory of the crisis . Rusk's reaction to the Soviet ships stopping short of a blockade line is a signature line in public memory .
 The blockade line was not a total success, but rather merely merely mostly successful . Yet the blockade line is not a complete success, as it was merely mostly success .
 The 22 October address declared, ‘To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated.’
 All ships bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain offensive weapons, be turned back’ Washington never detailed how it would handle a Soviet ship crossing the blockade line .
 The U.S. Navy’s lengthy rules of engage­ ment provided speak to the difficultly of accounting for the wide range of eventualities that could have arisen .
 The Bucharest, a tanker unlikely to carry sensitive cargo, was allowed to proceed without physical inspection . It was the first ship to carry a ship carrying a container carrying a cargo container .
 The East German passenger ship Voelker Fruendschaft too was permitted through the line . The ship was the first ship to sail from the East German coast .
 Its lack of weaponry provided the public excuse for the decision . The decision was motivated by the desire to avoid confronting a ship full of civilians . The ship was attacked by the U.S. Navy .
 25 Soviet submarines successfully violated the blockade line . 25 Soviet submarine missions successfully breached the blockade .
 American officials did worry that submarines could deliver sensitive materials such as nuclear warheads . Although an unlikely way to move cargo, it is unlikely to be used for cargo .
 The U.S. Navy’s encounters with these submarines produced some of the tensest moments of the crisis . The blockade never stopped them, but the blockade never prevented them .
 The same Central Committee meeting where the decision was made to turn back the freighters ordered, 'Keep the submarines on their approaches' Washington tolerated specific Eastern Bloc ships and submarines to pass through the blockade line rather than confronting them under unfavorable circumstances .
 This suggests that U.S. credibility did not require a sacrosanct line that brooked no violations . The U.N. credibility does not require that line, it does not need to be broken up .
 Kennedy's violations did not cripple the broader red line or his credibility moving forward . Kennedy's credibility will not be affected by the violations .
 Khrushchev wrote to him on 24 October, Our instructions to Soviet sailors are to observe strictly the generally accepted standards of navigation in international waters and not retreat from them .
 Khrushchev almost immediately backed off from this implied commitment to run the blockade . "Krushchev backpedaled" on the promise of running a blockade .
 President Obama rejected the legitimacy of the blockade over that inconsistency . He prioritized rejecting the legitimacy over rejecting it .
 Moscow had reason to hope that a favorable stalemate had emerged . The undeclared red line against firing on surveillance aircraft is still a red line . Russia and the U.S. have been at odds for years .
 The United States had successfully blockaded Cuba but also increasingly demonstrated its reluctance to attack . The U.S. had successfully blocked Cuba's trade embargo but increasingly showed reluctance to do so .
 Soviet surface-to-air missile site opened fire, downing an American U-2 over Cuba . Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr. was killed in the attack .
 There does not appear to have been extensive discussion of making such a declaration before Major Anderson’s death .
 President Kennedy did once state, ‘If they fire on us, tell them we’ll take them out,’ but it appears that nothing came of it .
 Unbeknownst to Washington, two Soviet generals in Cuba ordered the mis­ siles fired on their own initiative . The White House press statements on 26 and 27 October did not mention the issue .
 Nikita Khrushchev was furious that the SAMs fired without his orders . 'It was at that very moment – not before or after – that Father felt the situation slipping out of his control,' says Sergei Khrushchevich .
 He feared how the U.S. would respond and the possibility that further firing, perhaps by Cubans, would lead to disaster . He feared the United States would respond to the firing .
 McNamara advocated this policy shortly before learning of Major Anderson’s death . McNamara: “I’m glad we’ve had this policy in place since I was in charge of the military.”
 General Taylor’s report of the shootdown came with a recommendation for an airstrike on that SAM site the next day . The next day, General Taylor recommended that an airstrike be carried out .
 McNamara expected this strike to escalate to a larger bombing campaign and – most likely – invasion . Like McNamara, he expected a larger military campaign and invasion .
 Kennedy committed to retaliate after a shoot-down to the Pentagon but not the Soviets . Remarkably, Kennedy committed . to retaliate . Kennedy's commitment to retaliate was remarkable .
 That combination is difficult to reconcile with the declaration hypothesis . The declaration hypothesis is the declaration of the declaration .
 McNamara suggested that the United States declare a red line against shooting down U-2s after the first was shot down . McNamara also suggested that U.S. should not shoot down U.2s again .
 President Kennedy seriously contemplated retaliatory attacks on SAM sites firing at American aircraft the next day if diplomatic negotiations did not progress . Kennedy seriously considered retaliatory strikes if diplomacy failed to progress .
 What he did instead helps to reveal the limitations of the enfor­ cement hypothesis, says author .
 U.S. military action in response to U-2 shootdown also catalyzed that outcome . Secret concession to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey contributed to Turkey's decision .
 Kennedy used the credible threat of enforcement to as leverage to forge a broader deal to end the crisis . Rather than immediately retaliate or reveal an unwillingness to do so, Kennedy used it to use as leverage .
 There is now strong pressure on the president to give an order to respond with fire if fired upon when American reconnaissance planes are flying over Cuba . Because of the plane that was shot down, there is also strong pressure to give a response .
 The USA can’t stop these flights, . . . ut if we start to fire in response—a chain reaction will quickly start that will be very hard to stop . 9.9 Soviet perceptions of United States credibility peaked at this moment .
 The Kremlin broadcast its decision to remove missiles on Radio Moscow without waiting for normal diplomatic channels or consulting Castro Castro . The Kremlin did not consult Castro before making the decision .
 Had Kennedy not looked beyond the false choice between enforcing the U.S. red line and appearing weak for not doing so, the crisis might have ended differently .
 Conventional thinking counsels policymakers that they must declare clear red lines in order to deter . Conclusion: Policymakers need to declare red lines to deter terrorism .
 They must enforce those red lines after violations or else lose credibility . The U.S. government must enforce that red line or else it will lose credibility.
 Soviet and American leaders consistently evinced an intui­ tive understanding of what I have referred to as the enforcement, declaration, and unambiguity hypotheses . Soviet and U.S. leaders regularly evince an understanding of these hypotheses .
 In each instance, there is little reason to believe that they paid a price for doing so .
 Moscow knowingly left open the possibility that Washington could attack Cuba while denying that the U.S. had attacked the Soviet Union . Moscow knew that the United States had not attacked Cuba .
 Khrushchev’s calculated decision not to issue a statement to foreclose this tactic speaks volumes about how little he prioritized the credibility benefits of declaration, says historian .
 Kennedy made internal commitments to the Pentagon to retaliate after the shootdown of a U.S. surveillance aircraft without publicly conveying the red line to the Soviet Union . Kennedy, meanwhile, made internal threats to the United States .
 Khrushchev perceived the threat as credible nonetheless, the decision of his generals in Cuba to fire notwithstanding . The decision was made by his generals, but the threat was credible .
 This suggests that the lessons of the Korean and Gulf Wars are perhaps, perhaps, not what they have seemed . The lessons of these wars may not have seemed, it seems .
 The withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea in June 1949 and the absence of a tripwire in Kuwait may have mattered more . Nor does the evidence sustain the view that leaders must aggressively enforce their red lines after small violations lest deterrence crumble .
 President Kennedy set aside his demands about organized combat units and military bases in Cuba in return for the more important concession to remove the missiles . President Kennedy agreed to remove missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal of organized military units and bases .
 He tolerated a freighter, a passenger ship, and attack submarines crossing the blockade line . The ships more likely to carry weapons shipments turned back turned back .
 Soviet leaders’ fears of U.S. escalation spiked twice during the crisis, once when they learned that Washington had detected the missiles – but before Kennedy revealed his response – and once when Soviet forces shot down Major Anderson .
 Soviet ‘blink’ notwith­standing, those steps failed to halt Soviet progress toward readying the missiles . However, the Soviet 'blink' notwithstanding, however, did not halt progress .
 The final impetus came from Robert Kennedy’s adept leveraging of the potential U.S. response to the Soviet shootdown of a United States aircraft . Robert Kennedy was the president of the United States in 1968 .
 President Kennedy’s initial decision to hold the potential for a military response to the missiles in abeyance while exploiting Soviet fears of it . This mirrored and built on President Kennedy's initial decision .
 U.S. brinkmanship contributed to Soviet withdrawal of Jupiter missiles . Jupiter missiles concession contributed to the Soviet withdrawal .
 This success calls into question the criticism of President Obama’s Syria red line, because he used the same approach . The success of this success calls it into question President Obama's criticism of his Syria approach, the Journal of Strategy Studies says .
 Eliminating a substantial fraction of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal was an objective that seemed unachievable until the Russians put it on the table . Elimination of Syria's chemical weapons was an impossible task until Russia put it up for consideration .
 Only credible threat to retaliate after the Assad regime crossed his red line made it possible . Only the credible threat of retaliation made that possible .
 Current understandings of the role of ambiguity in deterrence and coercion paint a muddled picture for policymakers . The notion that Syria led to Russia’s invasion of Crimea is particularly overwrought .
 The resolution of that contradiction emerges from distinguishing ambiguity about demands from ambiguity about consequences . The resolution comes from distinguishing between demands and consequences .
 Leaders can set clear red lines while mitigat­ ing entrapment risks and preserving flexibility via ambiguity about crossing those lines . Leaders can also use ambiguity about the con­ sequences that cross those lines, say experts .
 Every threat save one made by either side of the crisis settled on this combination . Every threat from either side settled with this combination of the combination .
 It would be a mistake to believe that publicly declaring a red line is essential for its credibility . In short, it would be wrong to think that publicly declared a red-line is essential .
 It would be an error to regard either clarity or ambiguity as innately superior . It's a mistake to think ambiguity or clarity or clarity is superior to ambiguity or ambiguity .
 It could spell disaster to conclude that every small violation of a red line requires a military response . The U.S. military has been criticized for its actions in Syria .
