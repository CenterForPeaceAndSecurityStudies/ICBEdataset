 The NRO was intended to learn more about the internal workings of the USSR after the simplistic assumptions about ending the confrontation proved hopelessly wrong . NRO showed that Moscow was much weaker than human intelligence claimed .
 In achieving this result, though, it became so powerful that it functioned almost without any public supervision – almost a state within a state . The result is that it is almost a powerful state within the state .
 When the Soviet Union collapsed, the NRO became the instrument of Republican and Democratic Presidents alike to win the war on Washington’s next opponents, whoever they might be, without almost any congressional or democratic control .
 The NRO became Washington’s preferred weapon in the “war on terrorism” because its capabilities were hardly known, hard to stop, and much less capable of being defended against .
 The reorganization and expansion of America’s intelligence agencies was a most confusing process because of uncertainty about its future, how to proceed under the circumstances, and bureaucratic opposition, especially by J Edgar Hoover's FBI .
 Democratic followers of FDR had a difficult time in gaining support for a continuing international role, particularly when many of them were increasingly suspected of being communist tools . Given the weakened Republican opposition for a return to America’s splendid isolation, the Democratic followers had a hard time in getting support for
 The leader of the OSS had been Colonel ‘Wild Bill’ Donovan . He was involved in trying to revive the spy agency after its post-war shutdown was being reconsidered . The amalgamation of the code-breaking services of the Army, Navy and the new Air Force
 Hoover’s continuing opposition to any encroachments on his turf, especially because of his intense dislike of Harry Truman and his entourage, though, only the Armed Forces Security Agency and a weak Central Intelligence Group were allowed to be created .
 The NSA’s creation caused the greatest intelligence turmoil with the CIA . The fleeing of Soviet spies Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union provided the catalyst . The NSA was created in 1953 .
 NSA’s decoding capacity provided a sure way of proving so at the expense of other intelligence agencies, especially the CIA and its forebearers . Their flight proved that U.S. intelligence had been riddled with leaks, the NSA's decoding capacity .
 NSA was busy at Arlington Hall and later at Fort Meade working on Moscow’s coded messages during part of WWII with those who had had contact with Soviet intelligence . CIA really got involved in overthrowing governments Washington did not like .
 Few are aware of the successful coups that the Agency engineered against Iran’s Mohammed Mossadegh . Few are acquainted with its elimination of Korean opposition leader Kim Koo . The Agency also eliminated North Korea's Premier Kim II Sung, North Korea’�s Premier .
 DCI Allen Dulles hoped that Rowett aka The Magician could do some more magic on the Soviet codes . Dulles hopes Rowett will be able to crack down on the secret codes .
 Rowlett had been the leading genius of William F Friedman’s Black Chamber which the Army had reconstituted from WWI back in June 1930 . Friedman was now running the CIA's Division D, and wanted Rowlett to rejoin him .
 Rowlett had been responsible for breaking the Japanese diplomatic code Purple aka Magic on September 20, 1940, resulting in decrypts which showed that Japan was preparing to attack French Indochina . Rowlett failed to foresee that it would be triggered by the attacks on Hawaii .
 The only trouble with CIA’s ‘little NSA’ was that it had little to work with, Bamford said . The only problem was that the CIA had little work with . The CIA had a 'little NSA'
 Britain was finding out what Egypt was up to during the Suez crisis . NSA did not have a clue about Israel’s ambitions because that was co-conspirator Britain's responsibility during the preemptive action .
 Once Moscow learned of the intrusions, NSA's capability in this regard became greatly reduced, as the planes could be shot down . The Soviets rapidly improved their radar all over the vast country to achieve it .
 NSA’s embarrassment over difficulties – what caused the retirement of its first director, Ralph Canine – provided the CIA with an opportunity to recoup . Richard Bissell, the new Deputy Director for Planning, was quick to take advantage of it .
 Eisenhower was looking for a more reliable instrument for containing the struggle . Bissell had been given the post after its warring factions in carrying the war to the Soviets had been humiliated by the Hungarian uprising .
 Bissell’s claim to fame was the designing and construction of the U-2 reconnaissance plane which flew above the range of Soviet defenses . Bissell designed and built the plane for the U.2 .
 Bissell was given the assignment to put the U-2’s capability on an analytical intelligence basis . Bissell is credited with helping develop the capability of the U.2 .
 Agency’s HUMINT, its dominant side, did not see matters that way at all . Unfortunately, the Agency's HUMINT was not that way .
 William King Harvey arranged an engine 'flame out' which brought down Gary Powers’ unauthorized U-2 flight – making it look like the Soviets had brought it down for May Day 1960 celebration . But not only Powers but also his aircraft survived to Eisenhower’s great embarrassment, making
 Ike was forced to show what they could potentially disclose, somewhat minimizing the assertions by the “missile gap’s scaremongers . Ike: Given the fuss that Khrushchev made over the flights, the Paris Summit was canceled, and the Paris summit was canceled .
 Downing of Powers’ U-2 ruined the summit – what the President had put such great hopes in, and seriously considered resigning over – once the lying by the White House was exposed . Still, the downing of the U.S. U.2 ruined .
 The Soviet leader produced the pilot and part of the U-2 wreckage on television . No sooner had it denied any such overflight .
 Soviet explanation of the crash made no sense . Agency failed to explain how Powers still survived the doomed flight, as did plane itself .
 Moscow had been tipped off about the U-2 overflights by two NSA analysts . NSA analysts Bernon F Mitchell and William H Martin tipped off by Moscow .
 The increasingly dangerous antics by its Deputy Director Louis Tordella – who ran the agency for a generation – finally persuaded Mitchell to fly to Mexico City in December 1959 where he asked for political asylum . The KGB persuaded him to stay in place, so that it could learn more about NSA operations
 Tordella was Wright’s leading ally in Washington, prepared to do any operation which stirred up anti-communist paranoia . Wright was the CIA's leading ally, with the help of Wright .
 Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin tried feebly to make out in The Sword and the Shield that Mitchell and Martin had somehow defected then . They were in Washington on May Day when Powers went down . The two men were in D.C. at the time .
 They told Moscow of the planned ‘flame out’, and the Soviets made sure that it was shot down .
 Mitchell and Martin made their escape to the USSR via Mexico City and Havana . The crisis had passed without any claims of U.S. spying having contributed to the crisis . The two men were able to leave the Soviet Union via Cuba and Mexico City .
 Mitchell and Martin helped shoot down Gary Powers’ U-2 – something that neither Krushchev nor Ike wanted to know . Of course, it would have been a far different matter if Mitchell had explained that they had helped shoot .
 The defectors ultimately settled down grudgingly in the USSR, ultimately marrying Russian women . They contributed little more to Soviet covert government .
 Moscow could not afford them saying that they had made such sacrifices for nothing . Moscow, actually, could . not afford to . say that they made sacrifices for . nothing. Moscow .
 Eisenhower created the National Reconnaissance Office after the embarrassing show trial of Powers in Moscow had ended and right before the embarrassing press conference by Mitchell and Martin .
 CIA paid a high price for just keeping the ‘missile gap’ myth alive . CIA paid the price to keep the myth alive, says former CIA official .
 CIA exchanged the most successful Soviet spy, Colonel ‘Rudolf Abel’, for Powers when it got the chance .
 Division D got involved in trying to assassinate Castro, using the cover story that it was trying to steal codes and recruiting Cuban cryptographers . Then, thanks to the prodding by Wright Harvey, got Division D deeply involved in the assassination attempt .
 After the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion, Harvey was again at it – thanks to more prodding by Wright – as head of the Agency’s Task Force W in Miami . He provided agents with a wider variety of weapons to kill Castro but still no success .
 Kennedy had rightly raised the alleged ‘missile gap’ claim and the plans to overthrow Castro’s regime during the 1960 presidential campaign in the hope that the electorate could make a reasonable choice . Nixon wrongly declined to debate the issues on the grounds of national security .
 JFK suffered the black eye of the Bay of Pigs fiasco by Bissell’s people . The President reacted by forcing the retirement of DCI Dulles and DDP Bissell because of the fallout from the fiasco .
 The NRO had helped the anti-Castro Cubans before JFK spoke, and continued to do so right up until the invasion . NRO helped Cuban dissidents before the invasion of Cuba in the 1960s .
 When the White House learned of the NRO’s support for the bombers – what happened the next day at 10m. during a meeting at CIA headquarters . Secretary of State Dean Rusk and American Ambassador to the UN Adlai Stevenson insisted that there be no more aerial attacks
 Kennedy appointed Dr. Bissell to make sure that Bissell did not maintain informal influence in the NRO . Kennedy appointed Bissell after Bissell became president of the National Security Council . Bissell was a key adviser to the CIA .
 Joseph V Charyk, an Air Force undersecretary, as its director in Setepmber 1961 . Joseph V. Charyks was the Air Force's director in the 1960s .
 Charyk, though, was an areonautical engineer, only interested in developing replacements of the U-2s and new satellites . He only wanted to replace them with new satellites and satellites .
 Ledford was director of the U.S. Air Force’s special operations projects when JFK was assassinated . Ledford led the Air Force during JFK's assassination .
 SOD McNamara picked one-time FBI agent Joseph Carroll to head the new coordinating agency . Air Force Inspector General Joseph Carroll is not just another Pentagon bureaucrat .
 I Roger ‘Tough’ Touhy during WWII, but also helped explain away defections by Mitchell and Martin . Touhy made out that there were more homosexuals in government because of abnormal sexual activity while they were adolescents .
 The showdown with Cuba and the USSR over the IRBMs did nothing to redeem them, despite all the evidence that Oleg Penkovsky supplied about Moscow’s strategic weakness . And the showdown with Cuban and Soviet Union over IRBMMs did not redeem them .
 On October 15th, Carroll noticed signs of construction being carried out in a remote area of western Cuba, near San Cristóbal . He alerted the Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric about it, starting a process which would only end when Khrushchev started removing IRB
 Intelligence Board members met with President Obama in Dallas months before Dallas assassination . President hoped to keep the renegades at bay, but was assassinated .
 The fallout from the settlement drove Harvey, with Helms’s tacit approval, to increasingly desperate measures against the Kennedys .
 Harvey was head of the ZR/RIFLE project in the Agency’s new center of operations in Miami, code named JM/WAVE and run by Ted Shackley . Harvey misused NRO's capabilities to conclude his own war against Castro and the White House .
 Claiming that he was still trying to achieve Rowlett’s objectives, he arranged to make it look as if Castro had shot down another U-2 reconnaissance flight – what constituted an act of war, if true – once his efforts to recruit two Red Army colonels from the
 Most people thought that Cold War relations were improving with the Soviet withdrawal of its IRBMs from Cuba – with JFK and Mrs. Kennedy . While most thought that . relations with the . Soviet withdrawal from Cuba was a major setback .

 DCI John McCone reorganized all the Agency’s science and technical capability under one roof, ignoring the concerns of its predecessor, Deputy Director of Research Herbert Scoville, Jr.
 DCI in letting scientists who had tried to create intelligence zombies – former Technical Services Staff head Sidney Gottlieb, his new chief Seymour Russell, hypnotist Dr. Dr. Seymour Russell – . – let them go . The DCI, though, in letting the scientists who tried to
 Navy divers, operating from a PT boat in the Florida Straits, have found the wreckage of the plane . They have started salvage operations to raise the plane, a United Press Bulletin reported .
 His wife wrote a story entitled “I Believe My Husband Is All Right” from Leland, Mississippi where she was residing while he was performing this duty .
 Evidence on the craft would determine what it had encountered, and what was the cause of the crash . Its implication was that evidence would determine the crash's cause . The craft crashed in the early 1970s .
 The day after the fouled-up conspiracy assassination, interest in connecting it to Cuba simply died . Captain Hyde and the evidence within the downed U-2 were found .
 Much of the hoax was in evidence when the alleged deceased’s survivors were awarded at the Greenfield AFB in May 1964 his Distinguished Flying Cross and the Fifth Oak Leaf Cluster to his Air Medal .
 The crude cover up of this NRO hoax might have been exposed if several other more immediate cover-ups of the killing were not already underway . The agency was not the vital instrument of JFK’s lasting legacy – landing an American on the moon by the end of the decade .
 The Apollo program was the NRO’s baby, and it played it for all it was for all its worth . The NRO's Apollo program is the program's most ambitious attempt to date .
 While the NSA was getting embroiled in the Vietnam War because of its fabrications regarding the Tonkin Gulf incidents, the NRO was pushing everyone’s vision towards the stars . The NRO, with its satellites, spacecrafts, and new aircrafts, is pushing everyone's vision
 In its most secret enclave, it would get into much more dangerous projects and results, as we shall see . Still, in its most secretive enclave, the project would be more dangerous .
