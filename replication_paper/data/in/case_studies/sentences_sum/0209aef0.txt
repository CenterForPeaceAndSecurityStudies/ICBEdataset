 Benoît Pelopidas* Junior Chair of Excellence in Security Studies, Sciences Po. Overconconﬁdence in the controllability of nuclear weapons creates danger . Three sources of overconfidence in managing nuclear crises .
 This article reviews the scholarly literature about the limits of predictability and controllability of nuclear crises . It investigates three failures of learning from them .
 France displays in particularly acute form some of the sources of overconﬁdence in the controllability of nuclear crises that can been found in other nuclear armed states . This article offers the ﬁrst study of the French experience and evolving interpretation of the Cuban missile
 First, the publication and interpretation of primary sources is a contribution in itself given the frequent misconceptions about nuclear dynamics due to theory-driven extrapolations . Second, the study of nuclear dynamics in the U.S. has been published in the past .
 It challenges a widespread assumption of automaticity linking a fear-induced deterrent effect and the presence of nuclear weapons . Second, it challenges the assumption that automaticity is automatically linked to nuclear weapons.
 This article studies part of a regime of valuation of nuclear weapons . Third, empirically, this article studies the value of a nuclear weapon .
 It outlines a research agenda to take luck seriously in security studies . It outlines an agenda for security studies in the future .
 He was the last surviving elite participant in the 1962 nuclear crisis . The crisis is widely regarded as the closest humanity ever came to nuclear war .
 With his passing we have lost a direct link with the experience of very intense fear of imminent nuclear war . With his death we have also lost the learning of the crucial role of luck in preserving the world .
 "From now on, our interpretation of the danger of the most dangerous crisis in the history of the nuclear age is radically detached from direct experience at the highest levels of decision-making," says the UK nuclear minister .
 All nuclear weapons states are developing vast programmes to enhance their nuclear weapons capabilities . At the same time, tensions between Russia and the West remain high, and tensions between the US and Russia remain high .
 Benoît Pelopidas is the Junior Chair of Excellence in Security Studies, CERI / Sciences Po, 56 rue Jacob, 75006 Paris, France . He is also a Junior Chair in Excellence in Studies at Sciences Po .
 This crisis is widely considered to be the closest mankind has ever come to nuclear war . It is an essential case study for assessing the fear-inducing effects of nuclear weapons and understanding of nuclear learning .
 "I accept the assumption that national experience is a major source of learning. First, I accept that national experiences are a major part of learning," he says .
 Second, I accept the literature portraying overconﬁdence as a source of increased risks . I accept that overconventionalism is a risk, but it is not a good thing for the health of the nation .
 Third, I assume that shared international learning about the limits of controllability of nuclear weapons is an important precondition for more informed nuclear decision-making .
 As a consequence of these three premises, I regard the absence of learning, or forms of memory that systematically deny the role of luck and promote overconﬁdence as contributing to nuclear danger .
 The fact that learning is rare does not make its absence of learning any less problematic or puzzling . Learning is rare, but it doesn't make it less problematic, or puzzling.
 Not all policy and scholarly communities have judgment, restraint and diplomatic skill . However, not all policy, academic communities have restraint and skill .
 Paul Nitze considered the Berlin crisis as even more dangerous . Ray S Cline is one of those in the U.S. who maintains that the danger of the Cuban missile crisis was overestimated .
 Both of those judgements were formulated before the key discoveries of the 1990s reviewed in Section 1 . Section 1.
 This notion has been applied to nuclear weapons by Eric Schlosser in Command and Control . This notion was applied to the nuclear weapons .
 "The unbearable lightness of luck seems constantly to escape the learning process," says Drexler . "It's not easy to learn how to deal with luck," he says. "It seems to be that luck doesn't get to the end of the process"
 This article explores three reasons for this failure to learn, focusing on ideational factors . This article includes three reasons why people fail to learn from their education .
 I do not deny the role of institutional and bureaucratic dynamics in the entrenchment of representations related to nuclear weapons, which will be explored in a subsequent essay, but I don't analyse them here . I will not analyse them in the following essay .
 Staying at the level of ideas emphasises the responsibility of scholars and analysts to avoid overconﬁdence without waiting for structural or institutional change .
 Forms of learning that promote overconﬁdence have been documented across national cases . It has been documented in national cases of overconventionality .
 The limits to French nuclear learning explains limits to nuclear learning, explains the limits . Drawing on unexploited primary sources to illuminate this less-known case .
 If ofﬁcial representatives of all nuclear weapons states tend to portray themselves as responsible custodians of their nuclear arsenals . French stand out for their public display of conﬃdence in the perfect safety record of their weapons arsenal .
 Two weeks earlier, he had given a tour of the Luxeuil Air Force base and its former weapons storage facilities . Two weeks before, he visited the former weapons storey in France .
 This article treats such public conﬁdence as part of a puzzle, and analyses how such a statement has become possible and acceptable .
 Little has been written on the memory of key episodes in the nuclear age in France and their impact on French thinking about nuclear safety, security and possible nuclear futures . Overall, little has been said on the history of the French nuclear age .
 In addressing the puzzle of how the role of luck in the outcome of the Crisis, never adequately refuted, have not been integrated in the accepted body of knowledge about nuclear history and policy . This article makes three contributions to the puzzle .
 The focus on new French primary sources is relevant to security studies as well as policymaking circles given frequent misconceptions about nuclear dynamics . First, the focus on the new French sources should be relevant for security studies .
 Nuclear security studies scholars too often make unwarranted theory-driven extrapolations based on few or no primary sources . Theories of the ‘most dangerous crisis of the nuclear age’ are widespread in Western nuclear policy circles .
 The article tackles a widespread assumption of automaticity linking the presence of nuclear weapons to a fear-induced deterrent effect . Second, and consequently, the article tackles the widespread assumption that automaticity is automatic .
 Vipin Narang labelled this as ‘an existential bias’ in the literature on deterrence, focused on acquisition of nuclear weapons as the only meaningful threshold . Daniel Deudney locates in the tradition of focused on the United States and a second one including a Soviet and Cuban

 The 'ﬁrst wave' remains hegemonic, according to publications . However, publications around the 50th anniversary of the Crisis show that the ‘שּׁ�Rst wave’ remains heedemonic .
 This assumption crosses the policy divide over the desirability of nuclear disarmament . Indeed, this assumption crosses a policy divide .
 In their case, the weapons do not even need to be assembled in order to deter, their existence and the fear that they trigger need only exist in the mind of the deterred . In the case of the weapons, they don't need to even be assembled .
 The mere presence of nuclear weapons (physical or virtual) is expected to inspire fear on account of their destructive capacity . Such a dynamic, if granted, would constrain the scope for re-evaluation of these weapons, says author .
 In other words, the value of nuclear weapons would be irreducibly determined by the physics of nuclear devastation and unaffected by social and political factors . The value of nukes would also be determined by physics of devastation .
 If it turns out that the French experience and memory of the Crisis was largely unmarked by fear, this widely-held assumption of the automaticity of the effect of the presence of nuclear weapons will be opened to further challenge .
 As a result, the valuation of nuclear weapons will be reassessed as a socially and historically constructed process, irreducible to destructive capacity alone . As a consequence, the value of nuclear arms will be re-evaluated as a social constructive process, not destructive capacity .
 Study of the French case responds to Nick Ritchie’s invitation to study ‘regimes of value’ of nuclear weapons beyond his foundational case study of the UK . It also contributes to a growing literature on nuclear fear and atomic anxiety that has not documented the French experience in
 I ﬁrst review the most recent literature on the Crisis, with evidence showing that the situation was indeed dangerous and that its peaceful outcome cannot be reduced to successful, fully informed crisis-management .
 Nuclear weapons use was avoided in the autumn of 1962 not through restraint on the part of President Kennedy and the Soviet leadership only, but as a result of decisions made by individual nuclear operators, under conditions of incomplete or incorrect information .
 As a 2015 literature review concluded, ‘had everyone stopped researching … the crisis in the 1980s our awareness of the risks of nuclear war would be greatly diminished.’
 Kennedy administration underestimated the number of Soviet troops in Cuba, ignored that they arguably could be tactical weapons based in Cuba . Castro was actively pushing the Soviets to be more aggressive, says historian .
 Excomm members, we now know, were not informed when the head of Strategic Air Command took the unprecedented decision to place American nuclear forces on Defense Condition 2 . General Thomas Power made the decision .
 One of the missiles was even launched for a test from Vandenberg Air Force base, in California, on 26 October 1962 at 4 am, as planned before the Crisis, without the president knowing .
 Command and control problems also have to be taken into account, so that complete presidential control cannot be taken for granted . Second, and consequently, command and control .
 Many serious safety problems, which could have resulted in an accidental or unauthorized detonation or a serious provocation to the Soviet government, occurred during the crisis . The Soviet government was forced to withdraw from the Soviet Union in order to prevent a nuclear bomb detonation .
 None of these incidents led to inadvertent escalation or an accidental war, CNN.com reports . CNN's John Sutter says the U.S. military has not been involved in any of the incidents .
 He did not have unchallenged control of U.S. nuclear weapons . He did, however, have unchalenged control over United States nuclear weapons.
 He sent a cable to Khrushchev asking for a Soviet nuclear strike if the U.S. attacked Cuba . The cable was sent by the Soviet leader .
 Soviet jets scrambled to intercept the U-2 . F-102 interceptors were sent to escort it home and prevent the Soviet MIGs from freely entering US airspace . U.2 was intercepted by Soviet jets and sent home .
 On the Soviet side, a similar problem of the delegation of the authority to use nuclear weapons occurred . The Soviet side also had a problem of delegating the power of the nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union .
 President Obama's consistency is in itself problematic, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com .
 Kennedy’s severe illness, dependence on steroids, reliance on competing medical opinions and treatments from doctors with whom he did not share what the others were prescribing him, which might have affected his judgement . It neglects, for instance, Kennedy's .
 Third, the most recent research shows that weapons safety was very rudimentary at the time of the time . Weapons safety was also very rudimentary, according to research .
 NATO weapon handlers pulled the arming wires out of a Mark 7 nuclear warhead while they were unloading it from a plane . The arming wires were pulled out of the Mark 7 when it was being unloaded from the plane .
 Kennedy relies on large quantities of medication with potential psychotropic side effects and on competing treatments by doctors who do not know what the other treatments are . Whether or not Kennedy’s judgement was impaired or not, the point remains that betting on the consistency of a man who relies on medication
 Dr Eugene Cohen, Kennedy’s long-term endocrinologist, warned JFK against the dubious practices of one of his doctors . Dr Jacobson, nicknamed Dr Feelgood, was denied authorisation to practice medicine in 1975 . He would be denied his authorisation in 1975 to practice
 Accidental detonation of NATO weapons could have happened during the Crisis . The safety of the weapons was very problematic at the time, writes Andrew Hammond .
 As a result, one can reasonably claim that the danger of war was higher than leaders thought at the time . This is a result of the fact that leaders thought that war was more likely than they thought .
 In 1994, Len Scott and Steve Smith already observed, there is now ample evidence that the fact that the crisis did not lead to nuclear war was due to good luck . Good luck was due, in large part, to the fact, they say .
 This undermines the claims of those who think that nuclear crises can be safely managed, says BBC .
 James Blight attributed the outcome of the Crisis to ‘plain dumb luck’ and other key participants would come to share this view after a handful of oral history conferences conducted by Blight and colleagues .

 Campbell Craig raises important objections against Sagan’s work, but still fundamentally agrees with this point . Twenty years later, Campbell Craig still fundamentally disagrees with Sagan's work .
 Problems of limited or false information, misperceptions, limits of safety and presidential command and control over nuclear weapons, could all have led to inadvertent escalation .
 A narrative of control cannot fully account for the peaceful outcome of the Crisis and the part played by luck, says CNN.com's John Defterios .
 The risk frame makes it impossible to account for the limits of control and safety identiﬁed above or for the role of luck . In the ﬁrst case, which I characterise as an epistemic inconsistency, the risk frame is an inconsistency . The risk
 In the second case, which I characterise as a practical inconsistency, the role of luck and the limits of controllability will be denied in practice so that acknowledging them will not lead to a questioning of managerialism as an approach of nuclear crises on epistemological, ethical, or
 John Lewis Gaddis is perhaps the most explicit practitioner of the epistemic inconsistency view in English-language literature . He says the view is consistent with the fact that inconsistency is inconsistent .
 Hawks found it inconceivable that Khrushchev would have used nuclear weapons to defend Cuba in the face of such overwhelming American superiority . Hawks said it was inconceivable to use such a tactic .
 Leonov, see Thomas Blanton and James Blight, ‘A conversation in Havana’, Arms Control Today, 32:9 , 7.9 .
 Gaddis’s analysis is not only the place where he starts but also where it ends, even though he claims otherwise . As this quote suggests, this is not the place he starts with his analysis .
 In focusing on the two leaders, Gaddis renders the limits of leaders’ controls about the weapons . The possibility of pre-delegation of use as well as accidental explosions is invisible .
 By emphasising calculable risks and probabilities, he cannot account for unquantiﬁable pathways to disaster, also called possibilities, he says .
 This intellectual move illustrates that, as Mary Douglas aptly wrote, ‘risk is not a thing, it’s a way of thinking’ Most important is that this way is oriented towards a desire for control and faith in that .
 The founding father of risk-based nuclear strategy, Thomas Schelling, writes about ‘a controlled loss of control’ As I have argued elsewhere, Schelling’s legacy of conﬂating uncertainty and risk has produced the illusion that risk thinking was able to capture
 In most other cases, the role of luck is acknowledged in theory in theory but its implications and the questions it would raise are immediately denied at the same time, via its reincorporation in a narrative of control . In the case of luck, it is acknowledged but it is then
 This conclusion obviously ignores the episodes mentioned above in which the peaceful outcome of the Crisis is not reducible to a success of deterrence, notably because it resulted from a decision taken out of false information or because the exact cause of the behaviour is not well established .
 Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow’s 1999 revised edition of the classic but highly criticised Essence of Decision exempliﬁes this .
 They ostensibly accept normal accident theory, that is the idea that tightly coupled and interactively complex systems like nuclear weapons will inevitably lead to accidents . Yet they conclude with a recommendation in terms of manageability which is at odds with the theory or would assume that another disaster will happen before the nuclear
 Normal accident theory is that systemic accidents in complex and tightly coupled systems cannot be managed away . They conclude that ‘the potential for dysfunctionality exists and must be managed’.
 Nuclear crises have to remain manageable, so he starts his short analysis of the risk of nuclear escalation in history . He deliberately sets aside the case of the Crisis in which the crisis was not nuclear .
 Given that she recognises Cuba as ‘the most dangerous nuclear crisis so far’ and accepts the widest variety of dangers, it is very revealing that she ends up hedging her acknowledgement of the role of luck .
 Short-range atomic weapons in Cuba could have been rediscovered, she says . She also recognises the lack of information and existence of misperceptions .
 This rejection of counterfactual thinking seems to be a disciplinary limitation of diplomatic history . It has had a particularly strong inﬂuence on scholars of the Crisis in France .
 The Relevance, Morality and Cost-Effectiveness of Nuclear Weapons’ , 27.5.5, is a study of nuclear disarmament in the United States .
 The most complete study in French makes the exact opposite assumption . This is interesting given that the most complete French study makes the same assumption .
 This study has been translated into French and published by Odile Jacob in 2013 .
 In his ‘elements pour une théorie de la crise’ he fully acknowledges contingency and improvisations in crisis management . He warns against the dangers of systematisation and warns against systematising .
 French analysts do not adequately engage with the dangers of the crisis, writes Andrew Hammond . This hostility is one of the reasons why French analysts, strongly inﬂuenced by the tradition of diplomatic history, don't adequately engage .
 As Ned Lebow notes, the rejection of counterfactual thinking leads analysts to a historical teleology that neglects the role of luck and the validity of other possible worlds .
 He observed that prevailing accounts treated the actual outcome of the Crisis as necessary and were unable to grasp the Crisis itself as an event in the philosophical sense of the term . He said prevailing accounts treat the outcome as necessary as necessary .
 French accounts that assume that the Crisis has settled the matter are still valid decades later . American accounts focusing on surprise, accidents, and pathways to escalation is still valid, decades later.
 The lack of legitimacy of counterfactual reasoning and the study of other possible worlds in French IR circles is such that it is not a matter of debate . It is not an issue of debate, but the lack of debate is such a fact that it doesn't matter .
 He displays an interesting form of conﬁdence which cannot be reduced to control . He treats the possibility of accidents as conditions of possibility of a fate that prevents disaster . But acknowledges that this cannot last forever .

 Renouvin’s methodological intervention came out of a frustration with diplomatic explanations for the origins of the First World War . In all fairness, it came from a frustration .
 He wanted to move beyond the ‘narrow horizons’ of diplomatic history, from the relations between diplomats to relations between peoples, he said . He said: ‘I want to go beyond the narrow horizons of diplomacy,’.
 Renouvin’s direct successor interprets the outcome of the Crisis as resulting from ‘tacit bargaining’ between the two actors . Quite tellingly, he interprets outcome of Crisis as . resulting from 'tacot bargaining'
 His denial is justiﬁed on the grounds of disciplinary boundaries and the impossibility of testing alternative outcomes . To him counterfactual thinking is illegitimate in political science, he says .
 The French experience of the Crisis is idiosyncratically deprived of fear . This interpretation has been relatively stable over time . Reasserting control by . remembering an idiosyncratic experience .
 The contrast with other nuclear-armed NATO allies and permanent members of the Security Council is striking . The contrast is striking.
 The next generation blamed him for not being entirely consistent with this agenda though though . He was the next generation of people who blamed him .
 French President Charles De Gaulle did not voice any particular fear at the time . French military and intelligentsia do not seem to have felt such a threat, except in press reports for a few days after Kennedy’s speech on 22 October .
 A biographer of de Gaulle assumes that ‘because no American missiles were based in France, … she would not be an early target, even if it came to a nuclear exchange’,86 which is evidence for the ‘great calmness’ of France during the
 'The French were … contemptuous'88 while other British Cabinet ministers worried that war was imminent . Macmillan conﬁrms this impression when he writes that, faced with the threat of imminent nuclear war, ‘the French were… contemptuous’88 .

 Sherman Kent came to show some photographs to journalists to the journalists . Two days later, another piece was published to question the validity of this information .
 National mobilisations against the force de frappe did not take place before 1963 . The force was formed in the early 1960s .
 Joelle Beurier’s study of the year 1962 as represented in the French popular photo-journalistic outlet Paris-Match shows that in its pages the violence of the world was dramatised during the ﬁrst half of the . year but euphemised during
 The only French source suggesting serious fears of nuclear war came from the French Embassy in Washington . The embassy expressed deep worries associated with not having an anti-nuclear shelter .
 On balance, however, none of this conveyed a signiﬁcant level of fear or awareness of the danger in the context of the time, says author .
 A study of the world news segment broadcast in French movie theaters at the time, Regards sur le monde, suggests this absence of fear very strongly .
 The Revue de Défense Nationale carried a few columns worrying about the increasing arms trade between Cuba and the Soviet Union .
 Two articles published earlier in 1962 in this same journal discuss the risk of inadvertent escalation . This is all the more surprising as two articles published in 1962 also discuss the risks of accidental escalation .
 The Crisis beneﬁts from a longer article than other events including a few titles mentioning the possibility of a war . She notes that the lexicon as well as the iconography are downplaying the danger .
 This is evidence that for the French at the time, this is an Americano-Soviet crisis and that they are not involved in it . This is . evidence that . for the . French at . the time of the . time, the French were not . involved in the crisis,
 Algeria, which had been a French department since 1830, had become independent a few months before, on 18 March 1962 . A referendum took place in the middle of the Crisis, deciding that for the ﬁrst time the French President will be elected directly by the citizens .
 A failure to win this referendum would have meant the end of the Presidency of Charles de Gaulle, after four years in power under a new Constitution . Failure to win the referendum would mean the President of France would have been overthrown .
 U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara on shift to ﬂexible response has more impact on the French conversation than the crisis . McNamara's speech on the shift to an 'exactible response' has more effect on French conversation .
 This mostly reﬂects a fear of conventional war in Europe and a fear centered on Berlin . The fear is centered around Berlin, which is centered on the city of Berlin .
 The French intelligentsia was conspicuously silent during the Crisis . Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre had taken an early stance on nuclear weapons .
 Camus passed away before the Crisis, in January 1960 . Of course, one needs to keep in mind that Camus died before the crisis .
 Sartre, André Malraux, Simone de Beauvoir, and prominent Catholic intellectual Francois Mauriac seem to have been completely silent about the Crisis . The Crisis was a major crisis in France in the 1930s and 1940s .
 Part of the French population wrote to the president to share their hopes and fears . But this statement made no mention of the nuclear threat .
 The volume of published letters by Simone de Beauvoir that covers the years 1940–63 does not include any letter for the year 1962 .
 Her biographers Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier mention her visits to Havana with Sartre and comment on Castro . They do not make any mention of the missile crisis .
 His correspondence with fellow writer Jean Paulhan at the time mentions the OAS – Organisation of the Secret Army or Secret Armed Organization, an armed group opposed to the independence of Algeria – in the middle of a theological conversation, suggesting the primacy of domestic politics in French intellectual life at the
 In ‘Esprit’, there is an article by Stanley Hoffmann about the Franco-American relationship . But it is about the post-Second World War period .
 The only writing by Sartre related to issues of nuclear security was also published a year before the Crisis, at the time of the Bay of Pigs .
 None of the cards of best wishes for the year 1963 which have been kept mentioned the favourable conclusion of a very risky and scary crisis . Similarly, none of the best wishes from the year of 1963 have been mentioned .
 In-depth study of French sources suggests that the French experience of the Crisis ignored the risk of nuclear war or nuclear weapons accidents . The French experience did not display the level of fear expected by security studies scholars to do .
 This absence of fear persists in more recent statements by the few French public ﬁgures who have expressed an interpretation of the Crisis . The absence of a fear persists, however, according to some of the French people .
 He continued by saying that this was ‘not his business’ since he was in charge of economic relations and it did not disturb his daily work . However, he continued to say that it was not his business . He said that he was responsible for economic relations .
 The presence of aggressive letters to De Gaulle blaming him for the outcome of the Algerian war suggests that no purposeful sanitation has taken place . However, the presence of angry letters suggests that there has been no sanitation .
 The presence of correspondence with private citizens and with mayors of France which did not call for or receive an answer suggests that expressions of fears would not have been removed simply because no one replied to them .
 The kind of letter I was looking for would not have been either offensive or easy to single out . In any case, the letter was not particularly offensive .
 Sudhir Hazareesingh had already noted that major events like May 1968 had generated a surprisingly small amount of correspondence from the French population from the country .
 The silence of the available correspondence can plausibly conﬁrm my argument . Therefore, therefore, the silence of available correspondence is plausible, he says .
 Gabriel Robin offered a revisionist interpretation of the causes of the Crisis and its resolution but his book was ignored by scholars as well as policymakers . Raymond Aron did not live to see the major revelations of the 1990s, but he lent his authority to a persisting narrative of control and
 The evolution and outcome of the Crisis were just additional evidence that nuclear weapons created a shared rationality – even when dealing with enemies like the Soviet Union . For him, the evolution of the crisis was just another example of the shared rationality .
 Gallois felt that the Crisis was not threatening because its progressive evolution led to the alerting of strategic nuclear forces that in turn forced the two great powers to negotiate . Gallois said that the crisis was not a threat because it led to alerting the ofﬁcial alerting
 Gabriel Robin told the author that the ideas of his book were either ignored or quickly disregarded among his colleagues in the French foreign service . Gabriel Robin said that his ideas were ignored or disregarded .
 In his memoirs, he treats the Crisis with no more than a reproduction of a paragraph of a letter he received from Carl Schmitt congratulating him for his analysis . In the memoirs he writes only a few words about the crisis .
 We were not able to do so with much smaller means such as the pistol, the machine gun, or even the canon . We were able to use the pistol and machine gun to carry out the mission .
 We are working with something which is inﬁnitely calculable and we know ahead of time what the results will be . We are not going to be able to predict the outcome of the test .
 Teaching the Crisis is no longer mentioned in the ofﬁcial guidelines the years for which school is still mandatory . The guidelines no longer mention teaching the crisis in the guidelines .
 The Crisis does not appear in the list of 43 landmark dates from the third millennium BC to today that French students have to master at the end of mandatory schooling . It has disappeared from the guidelines for ages 11 to 15 since 2013 .
 For the rest of high school, the Crisis allows the missile crisis in conversations with his family . The recommendations suggest that the crisis allows him to discuss the crisis with his parents .
 This might have happened had he thought there was a serious risk of nuclear war . This might not have happened if he thought of a serious nuclear war.

 Gallois cut it out of a newspaper and kept it in his records . I regard it as telling that Gallois chose to cut it from a newspaper rather than a newspaper . It is telling that he chose to keep it in the records .
 This relative fearlessness contrasts with implicit assumptions in policy circles of a common understanding of the Crisis . Security studies scholars’ conviction in the dread induced by the destructive capability of nuclear weapons .
 Full awareness of the limits of knowledge of and control over nuclear weapons is crucial for historical accuracy, for nuclear learning, and as a starting for a fruitful nuclear weapons policy debate .
 This awareness is all the more important as overconﬁdence has been shown to be a cause of increased danger . Overconventione is a cause for increased danger in the world .
 In order to understand the construction of such overconﬁdence, I accept the idea that learning occurred mostly at the national level and focused on the French case, in comparative perspective .
 Those who don't take these elements seriously have done so via epistemological or practical inconsistencies . I have shown how those scholarly ﬁndings have not been adequately refuted and argued that those who do not take them seriously .
 The rejection of counterfactual thinking as a legitimate scholarly practice is another way of rendering these ﬁndings invisible without having to refute them . The rejection is a way to render these  invisible and invisible without having to resolve themselves .
 Memory of the Crisis that is not based on fear does fuel overconconﬁdence in the safety, controllability, and predictability of nuclear crises . The French example is used to show that an experience and of-of-the-crisis memory of the
 American and British elites and populations did not grasp the full extent of the dangers at the time . But, unlike the French, they certainly experienced fear .
 Social scientists cannot let Fidel Castro take the unbearable lightness of luck with him to the grave . First, social scientists can't let Castro take lightnessness of fortune with him, they say .
 Further exploration of politics of luck and how the distinction between risk and uncertainty has been blurred would be a critical step towards a reconceptualisation of nuclear controllability . Such a re-imagination would place luck at the heart of political and ethical action, power and responsibility .
 The exact same instructions were there in 2010 and can be found for series L and ES in 2015 . In 2010 the instructions were available for series E and series L .
 Cases of near-nuclear use need to be requaliﬁed as events worth investigating . Second, cases of near nuclear use should also be considered as worthy of investigation .
 Diplomatic historians and security studies scholars could fruitfully join forces independently of their views on the value of counterfactuals . Diplomats and security scholars could join forces independent of views .
 We need further investigations into the history of nuclear-armed states to unearth primary documentation about the past security and safety record of nuclear arsenals . We need to allow rigorous counterfactual thinking, going beyond risk thinking .
 Comparative critical oral histories of nuclear close calls would help recover the limits of control over nuclear weapons as a legitimate object of scholarly interest . Comparative oral histories would likewise help .
 Such an approach would tackle the scholarly problem of uncritical reliance on accounts from former ofﬁcials, while addressing the policy problems that result from misguided assumptions of a shared experience and interpretation of events like Crisis Crisis .
 The empirical dimension of this article is only a ﬁrst step in this direction . The empirical dimensions of the article are only a few steps forward .
 This research programme allows analysts to start working against overconﬁdence without waiting for structural or institutional reforms . It suggests that they have a responsibility to do so .
 In security studies, it is crucial to reassert the socially and historically constructed process of valuation of nuclear weapons . The destructive capability of nuclear . weapons triggers adequate fear, which in turn initiates a learning process that is sufﬁcient for existential deterrence .
 Identifying the effects of rejecting counterfactual thinking and documenting the diverse experiences and memorialisations of nuclear danger are ways to understand and counter overconconﬁdence in their controllability .
