 Bonesteel focused on training and resourcing during the initial period of World War 11 . He focused on resourcing and training during the early period of WW11 . Bonesteels trained and resourced during the period .
 His intent as a manager was to achieve realistic readiness within his troop formations before going onto the battlefield . He said: 'He wanted to achieve realism within his troops formations before he went on the battlefield. He wanted to be realistic'
 He integrated the British training model into the American training model to prepare new recruits for the fog of warfare during basic training instead of during their initial engagements with Axis forces .
 The British trained with live ammunition, TNT, and induced a stressful environment to create a realistic training environment harsher than actual combat . This resulted in a greater number of unwarranted and unnecessary injuries or deaths .
 Bonesteel contacted General Huebner, Assistant G-3 in the War Department General Staff, to send officers and noncommissioned officers to observe the British training system for incorporation into the American training model .
 Huebner’s men observed the British training model, but in their reports assessed the British model to be insignificantly different from their American training model . The British model was not significantly different from the American model, according to their reports .
 Bonesteel’s ability to anticipate critical resource requirements contributed to American topographical understanding of Europe, he says . He says he was able to anticipate the resource requirements of Europe .
 He supervised the relocation of the British Military Map Library across the Atlantic Ocean to the American Engineer Map Library for security during World War 11 . The library was relocated to the U.S. for security .
 This critical resource enhanced strategic and operational planners’ understanding and visualization of the theaters of war . It also enhanced the understanding of the wars’s theater of war and military operations .
 Lemnitzer recommendation facilitated the establishment of a unified mission command over Allied forces as the Allied Forces Plans Section chief . Lemnitzitz was the Allied forces plans section chief of Allied Forces plans .
 The action was important because the previous Allied forces command structure established for General John Pershing’s American Expeditionary Forces during World War I had not been unified . The action is important because of the previous command structure .
 Pershing’s command was contested between parallel and amalgamated chains of command, and did not fully integrate commands to their full potential . Pershing's command did not include parallel chains of commands and integrated commands .
 Parallel chains of command receive command orders from or approved by the political leader of their country of origin, but not from the senior military commander in theater . Parallel chains receive orders from their country's political leader .
 World War 1 placed American forces into British or French units and subjected them to existing command structures of either foreign country . Unit integrity is maintained .
 The negative aspect of amalgamation is that original unit integrity can be abolished . Original unit integrity will be abolished, says the mayor of Toronto .
 For example, an American division could be 46 Bonesteel, “General Charles H Bonesteal Ill, United States Army Retired,” 101 . Bonesteels is a retired general .
 Unified mission command also assists a manager in concentrating his resources at the decisive point on a battlefield by removing the time-consuming coordinations necessary in parallel command structures . Unified mission commands also help a manager concentrate his resources in a battlefield . Unified command structures can also be used to coordinate military operations
 Lemnitzer enabled the establishment of a unified mission command system by bringing to the attention of General Eisenhower . British troops inside the Allied Forces Headquarters could appeal to their national chain of command if they did not agree with the Allied chain of . command’s directives’. Lemn
 The British request effectively created two chains of command, injecting additional friction and generating unnecessary distrust amongst allies . The request was created by the British request .
 Eisenhower undertook actions to dissolve this request before he would consent to become the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . Eisenhower took action to dissolve the request before consenting to become Supreme Allied commander .
 Lemnitzer’s initiative unified the military chain of command inside the Allied Forces . Units subordinated units to the orders of their military commander singularly and not to their national politician's orders . The initiative was the result of the initiative .

 Multiple Research and Development concepts presented themselves at this time and in the following years . Multiple R&D concepts were presented during this time .
 The DUKW is a General Motors Corporation naming acronym meaning 'D' designed in 1942, 'U' utility vehicle, ‘K’ all-wheel drive, and ‘ W’ dual rear axles . The acronym means ‘D’ which means �
 The DUKW is a six-wheeled amphibious vehicle that can operate on land or in water . The vehicle can be operated on both land or water and is amphibious . It is the first amphibious amphibian vehicle to be launched in Australia .
 Bonesteel’s basketball teammate and fellow West Pointer, Frank S Besson, introduced him to the idea of utilizing the DUKW in the Sicily campaign due to its effectiveness in the Pacific theater .
 The DUKW was particularly effective since it enabled troops to disembark from naval ships while still on the ocean, navigate open water to the beachhead, and drive up on land .
 The concentration of combat capable manpower is important to securing beachheads . It is also important to secure beachheads in the area .
 Bedell Smith was also a family friend of his father’s tracing back to Fort Benning, Georgia . Smith's father, Bedell, was a friend of Smith's and family .
 The Mediterranean Sea has geographical sand formations surrounding its islands that prevent naval ships from reaching land except in established port areas . These key areas likely had Axis forces overwatching them and indicated a potential Allied invasion landing site .
 Over seven hundred DUKWs were employed as a secret troop transport weapon as a result of Bonesteel’s actions during the July invasion of Sicily . The DUKWs were employed in Sicily as part of the July 1944 invasion .
 Allied forces were able to successfully land on numerous beaches and relatively unopposed by defensive forces during Operation Husky . Allied forces successfully landed on several beaches and were unoppested by defensive troops .
 The Bailey Bridge was another critical enabler to successful Allied combat operations . The bridge was built in 1941 in New York City .
 The Bailey Bridge was lightweight enough for tanks to carry due to its construction of metal beams and wooden planks . It was made of wood and metal beams that were lightweight enough to carry .
 Bonesteel worked with Besson to refine the original Bailey Bridge concept and mass-produce it in the U.S. for employment in support of the Operation Husky invasion through Sicily into Italy . The Bailey Bridge was produced in the United States for use in the operation .
 Bailey Bridge was considered a secret weapon during the invasion of Europe . The Bailey Bridge is considered a top secret weapon by the British Empire .
 The bridge capabilities exponentially increased the mobility and decentralization of mechanized Allied forces from the restrictive routes which were reliant on established bridge crossing sites known to the Axis forces . Allied forces were able to bypass established bridge crossings to bypass the Axis .
 Lemnitzer’s actions contributed to the success of the North African invasion, Salerno campaign, and Anzio campaign during World War 11 . He was the lead Allied planner for the North and Salerno campaigns .
 Charles Bonesteel is a retired U.S. Army general general . He is credited with saving the lives of soldiers in the United States Army .
 He established a cooperation agreement with leadership of the local French force to assist the American troops in landing unopposed during Operation Torch . He established an alliance in North Africa between the American and the French troops to fight against any Axis forces that appeared after the landing .
 Lemnitzer traveled in the Seraph submarine to reach the French Algerian shoreline undetected . The Seraph submarine made its way undetected to the shoreline of France .
 Major General Mark Clark and Brigadier General Lemnitzer secretly met with French Major General Charles Mast to try and convince Vichy French forces in North Africa to not resist Allied landings . There were no Axis forces within French controlled areas of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia based upon a
 The 1940 agreement stated that Vichy French forces would defend North Africa from invasion by Axis’ enemies . The deal was signed by the French government in June 1940 .
 Lemnitzer’s reconnaissance produced critical information which enabled detailed analysis for the final planning and coordination required for the successful execution of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in 1942 .
 Bonesteel was an important staff planner from February 1942 through the completion of World War 11 . Bonestesteel understood how to synchronize the ways and means available to achieve the desired operational end states . He was a key member of staff planning .
 Binder, 83, was the Chief Engineer Planner responsible for ensuring the 65 Binder . Binder was responsible for the creation of the Binder-led team .
 Bonesteel ensured that sufficient concentration of Allied forces occurred on the battlefield in a manner to overwhelm opposing German forces . The Battle of the Second World War ended in a victory over the Germans .
 Lieutenant General Eisenhower established Fifth Army following Operation Torch, placing his former deputy deputy . Eisenhower established the Fifth Army after Operation Torch .
 Clark requested Brigadier General Lemnitzer to serve as his deputy chief of staff in 1943 . Clark requested the request in 1943 for the deputy chief-of-staff position . Clark was the first officer of the Air Force to carry out the mission .
 The command was over the same 34 th Antiaircraft Brigade he originally commanded prior to his assignment as the Allied Forces Plans Section chief . The brigade was the 34th antiaircraft brigade .
 Lemnitzer's brigade fell under Lieutenant General George Patton’s Seventh Army during Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily that summer . The brigade was part of the Seventh Army in Sicily .
 He relinquished command of the brigade after the landing phase of Operation Husky . He transferred to the Allied Fifteenth Army Group .
 Brigadier General Lemnitzer assumed the position of deputy chief of staff for British General, Sir Harold Rupert Leofric George Alexander, as part of the Allied Fifteenth Army 70 Bonesteel, “General Charles H Bonesteels Ill, United States Army Retired,�
 From the Irrawaddy to the Po, 1941-1945 (South Yorks, Great Britain: Leo Cooper, 2000), 47; Binder, 104. Binder: The Po, from 1941 to 1945, was a major source in the history of the Po .
 Lemnitzer’s contributions to the success of the Allied war effort included building international coalition relationships, planning the Salerno and Anzio invasions, and facilitating the surrender of German troops in Italy . Lemnitzitz helped build international coalition relations and planning the invasion of Sal
 General Alexander believed Lemnitzer’s actions as the deputy chief of staff strengthened the relationship between American and British military staff . General Alexander believes Lemnitz' actions strengthened the U.S.-British relationship .
 Strengthening the relationship between U.S. and British officers was important . Each country's institutional military leadership development program was fundamentally different, he says .
 The American military system and culture rested responsibility on the commander for making decisions and planning operations, whilst the British system rested responsibility for the commander’s staff to plan in a collective methodology .
 Lemnitzer’s planning of the Salerno and Anzio invasion operations after the Sicily campaign . Many of these allied interactions occurred during the planning of these operations . The Salerno invasion operations were planned for the summer of 1944 .
 British and French military had low opinion of the American military’s capabilities as the newest country to the Allied war effort . One of the significant initial challenges he faced was the low opinion held by the British, French military .
 Clarke, 47; Binder, 106, died in North Korea . Binder was killed in the U.S. bombing of North Korea in 2009 . Clarke and Binder died in the fighting .
 Numbered naming conventions for Aimy Groups were derived from totaling the subordinate Army numbers within the Group . Aimy groups were named after their subordinate Army Numbers .
 People apprehensive of the number 13 likely worked to continue calling it the 15 th Army Group to avoid being called the 13th Army Group . People in the U.S. worked to avoid calling it 13 th Army Groups .
 General Patton’s impressive tactics in the Sicily campaign . General Eisenhower ordered General Alexander to re-mission Patton's Army from a supporting role to a leading role . Lemnitzer's ability to function cooperatively with the British leadership .
 Patton’s Seventh Army reached the final Allied objective of Messina in the Sicily campaign before the planned and intended force of General Montgomery . General Montgomery's intended force was the intended force for General Montgomery. Patton's Seventh Army .
 Patton’s performance contributed to increased Allied respect of U.S. military capability . Patton's performance helped to increase Allied respect for American military capability, he says . Patton died in the Battle of Gettysburg in June 1944 .
 Lemnitzer’s superior role in staff planning operations, cooperating with fellow Allied planners, and negotiating the surrender enabled the linkage of the tactical actions on the ground to the accomplishment of the strategic Allied objectives, he says .
 Lemnitzer advanced to the rank of major general in June 1944 after the completion of the Anzio invasion . Lemnitzi was promoted to major general after the invasion .
 British General Alexander was promoted to the ra nk of field marshal . He was given the responsibility of supreme allied command over the Mediterranean theater of operations in December 1944 . Alexander was also given the control of supreme Allied command over Mediterranean operations .
 Lemnitzer’s role in negotiating the surrender of German troops operating in Italy was integral to achieving the surrender . The surrender of the Axis forces in the European theater was achieved in the wake of the Second World War .
 Major General Lemnitzer’s German counterpart, General Karl Wolff, commanded the Schutzstaffel troops in Italy . General Wolff was the principal senior officer negotiating the German surrender with Lemnitz and Airey .
 Field Marshal Albert Kesselring commanded German conventional forces in Italy . While not present at the meetings, participants believed he had a similar mindset as Wolff, that Germany was defeated and surrender was appropriate .
 Lemnitzer’s chief tactic in the negotiations was limiting the terms of the dialogue to an unconditional military surrender of all German forces in Italy while not addressing political, economic, or any other aspects the Germans attempted to bring into the negotiation .
 This occurred to ensure speed and simplicity in the military surrender negotiation process while preventing the complexity of diplomatic or economic issues from slowing the process . The process was designed to ensure the simplicity and speed of the negotiations .
 Wolff worked to find a way to connect Hitler with the political leadership of the American and British forces if Hitler considered the possibility of a German surrender in the future . Wolff met with Adolph Hitler during this summons to explain he had found a way of reaching out to the leadership of
 During the period of suspended negotiations, two important military actions occurred . During the suspension of talks, two key military actions took place .
 General Heinrich Vietinghoff replaced Field Marshal Kesselring as commander of German conventional forces in Italy . First, Heinrich Vidal was replaced by Field Marshal Kesselring, Field Marshal Vidal .
 Field Marshal Alexander began offensive operations against the Axis forces in Italy with his Fifth and Eighth Armies . Second World War II was the first major offensive offensive operation in Italy .
 Lemnitzer and Wolff now had a new commander of conventional German forces in Italy to convince that a speedy and unconditional military surrender was the best decision . The new commander had to convince the Germans to surrender .
 Additional losses of German forces to Field Marshall Alexander’s Army strengthened Lemnitzer's negotiation position . Additional losses to Alexander's Army strengthened the negotiations .
 Lemnitzer again demonstrated his talent as an operational artist at this point . The show was the first of its kind in the history of the U.S. Navy .
 The Soviet Union pressured American and British officials to give them a role in covert negotiations for the surrender of German troops in Italy . The Soviets pressured the U.S. to give it a role .
 Lemnitzer learned of the Soviet’s desire, he based his response on Soviet standard negotiations, a negotiator, and a political officer . Lemnitz: "I'm not going to be surprised, but I'm going to make a deal with the Soviets"
 The Soviet presence was limited to the parameter of one man who spoke English so as not to make the covert negotiation footprint large and noticeable . It was only the one man speaking English .
 Lemnitzer anticipated the likely conflict this would create regarding the Soviet standing operating procedure for sending a political representative to oversee the actions of their military officers . Lemnitz anticipated the likelihood of the conflict, which would create a conflict over the issue .
 This enabled the American and British leaders to achieve their objective of maintaining a relationship with the Soviets . It enabled the Soviets to deselect themselves from becoming engaged in the surrender negotiations .
 American and British leadership did not want the Soviets involved in the surrender negotiation, as they believed the Soviets were purely interested in becoming stakeholders to gain control of Northern Italy and the port of Trieste for access to the Mediterranean Sea .
 In late April, the surrender negotiations resumed as Wolff and Vietinghoff s representatives who had diplomatic authority to act on behalf of their state met with Lemnitzer to finalize the surrender of German troops in Italy .
 Lemnitzer facilitated the accomplishment of a strategic objective through tactical action with the surrender of German troops in Italy . Lemnitz facilitated the success of the German forces in Italy during the war .
 Colonel Bonesteel worked in the Operations and Plans Division on the War Department General Staff at this time and from October 1944 to May 1948 . He worked for the Army during the Second World War .
 The Japanese Surrender and the Battle for Post War Asia , 139; Bonesteel, “General Charles H Bonesteels 111, United States Army Retired,” 179; . The Japanese surrender and the battle for post-war Asia, 139; .
 Bonesteel challenged the State Department’s implementation of the presidential policy which called for an unconditional surrender . His intuition and astute understanding of the Japanese culture and the military sub-culture of Japanese Army would not lay down their arms unless their Emperor directly ordered their surrender .
 Conditional surrender through the Japanese emperor was the only culturally effective way to achieving the strategic objective of long lasting peace, says the author of the book .

 American public opinion desired a swift demobilization, while the War Department desired a gradual demobilizing . The Soviet Union wanted to expand their ideological areas of control and influence . The War Department wanted a gradual, but public opinion wanted a swift, but gradual approach .
 The War Department structured a points system based upon the length and difficulty of a soldier’s tour . The points system was designed to facilitate the gradual downsizing of the military .
 All men with over two years of service were discharged from the services . The public clamor so great that all men with two-year-service were discharged . Public clamor was so great it was discharged from service .
 The number of army divisions dwindled from ninety-one in 1945 to ten in 1948 . Army Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps also reduced in numbers .
 Post-World War II reductions in army manpower numbers reflected similar historical patterns of the post-WWII reductions which Lemnizter had initially experienced at the beginning of his military service . The army's manpower numbers were similar to that of the pre-WWI reductions Lemnzter
 Post-World War II politics and policies denoted a new role for the U.S. in international affairs . Post-WWII politics and policy denoted the United States' new role in world affairs .
 The United States’ foreign and defense policies transformed from a posture of isolation with free market capitalism to a reliance on maritime security and wartime mobilization . The U.S. changed from isolation with isolation to dependence on wartime mobilization with free .
 The United States invested in the United Nations as a collective defense measure in 1945 . The U.N. was established in 1947 as a defense measure and for executing nonnuclear deterrence measures with regional military alliances .
 Bonesteel helped facilitate the linkage of strategic and operational objectives at the conclusion of World War II . He would influence post-war reconstruction and strategic policy .
 Bonesteel was the Chief of the Strategic Policy Section in 1945 with the parallel post-war purpose of rebuilding the Japanese economy, similar to the later Marshall Plan for Europe . He was the chief of the strategic policy section in 1945 .
 Colonel Bonesteel worked under Secretary of State George Marshall from June 1947 to June 1948 to draft the Marshall Plan to rebuild post-war European economies . He drafted the plan under George Marshall to rebuild European economies after World War II .
 Bonesteel’s work as staff officer with the Japanese surrender and reconstruction as well as his participation in development and execution of the Marshall Plan left a definitive ‘finger print’ on influential strategy .
 Lemnitzer was instrumental in building of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the alliance concept of military assistance in the late 1940s . Lemnitzitz was the architect of the N.A. Treaty Organization in the 1950s .
 Harriman served as ambassador to Russia, ambassador to Great Britain and secretary of commerce . Harrimans was director of Mutual Security Agency, 1951-53 .
 Clifford C Matlock interviewed by Richard D McKinzie in Waynesville, NC on June 6, 1974 . See also, “Second Oral History Interview with Clifford C . Matlock,” by Richard . McKinzie .
 Matlock discussed how Averell Harriman requested Bonesteel to become his Executive Director . Matlock was the political adviser, European Coordinating Committee, London, 1949-50 . He was political adviser to Harrimans during the period .
 Matlock’s World War 11 and post-World War 11 experiences also included Economist and administrator, Board of Economic Warfare, Foreign Economic Administration, 1942-45 . Economist and political officer, United States Dept, of State, 1946-62; . economist and political . officer,
 When Czechoslovakia fell to communism in 1948, the Five Powers signed an alliance known as the Western Union with the concept of each member providing military assistance for another if their state was threatened . The Western Union was formed in the wake of the fall of communism in the Czech Republic .
 The Western Union would expand in membership and eventually became known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over time . Western Union expanded in membership in the U.S.
 Lemnitzer’s secret negotiations and personal relationships within the Western Union states combined with his coordination through the American legislative process over the purpose, requirements, and authorities of the alliance concept for military assistance .
 Lemnitzer’s ability to reach consensuses for providing and combining military equipment and defensive capabilities within the alliance at the tactical level enabled the achievement of the strategic objective for protecting states from the spread of communism while minimizing the negative impact of downsizing defense budgets .
 Ohly interviewed by Richard D McKenzie and Theodore A Wilson in McLean, VA on November 30, 1971 . See also, “Oral Flistory Interview with John H Ohly,” interview with Ohly .
 Lemnitzer was chosen to represent the Secretary of Defense in late 1948 to attend the Western Union meetings . Ohly was Special Assistant to the secretary of Defense from 1947-49 . Lemnitzitz was chosen by the Department of Defense to attend those meetings .
 Ohly’s experiences additionally included Attorney in the Office of Assistant Secretary of War, 1940-46 . Ohly also specializing in labor relations, manpower, manpower and related matters in the Army Service Forces .

 Universal military training, a post-World War 11 concept for mandatory military training and universal reserve service for all American males at eighteen years of age, passed through Congress as the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951 . Universal military service is mandatory for all U.S. males at 18
 This reflected an open political reliance on the draft in times of war and not a belief in a requirement for genuine universal military service or training for all American males . The draft reflects an open reliance on draft in war times, rather than a requirement of genuine universal service .
 Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 created three categories of military reserve service duty . Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve, and Retired Reserve — for males between 18 and a half to 26 years of age . Those who had served in the military or had been selected by the Universal Military Training and
 This system enabled the active duty military to remain small during times of peace and effectively expand during periods of war . The system was designed to keep the active military small during peace and expand during war .
 From 1950 and the beginning of the Korean War through 1961 the United States Army mobilized over 2. million men and twenty divisions to fight in Korea and maintain security in America under the ominous threat felt from the Soviet Union .
 Reserve and National Guard forces relied upon to reinforce the reduced active duty Army numbers following the Second World War . Reserve forces were relied upon by the Army following the war .
 Lemnitzer and Bonesteel’s professionalism and skill sets had been identified by many senior leaders, says CNN.com.com's John Sutter.com .
 President Eisenhower selected both officers to be part of the 1953 Project Solarium, which provided strategic analysis for three proposed methods to defeat or contain communism . Both officers were selected as part of a plan to defeat communism .
 Project Solarium was to study and analyze different approaches to prevent the Soviet Union from spreading the communist ideology to other states . Similar in nature to the rational that brought the Five Powers together (leading to the formation of North Atlantic Treaty Organization), the purpose of the project was to examine different approaches
 The North Korean People’s Army crossed the 38th Parallel in the summer of 1950 in an attempt to forcibly unify the Korean Peninsula through conquest . The U.S. defense policy of deterrence began to transition to containment of the spread of communism .
 Project Solarium consisted of three groups directed to prepare American foreign policy against communism . The groups focused on containment, roll back, or drawing the line .
 The general intent was for each group to analyze and articulate why their plan was the best policy . Each group was asked to articulate their plan for the future .
 The Supreme Allied Commander Europe in the 1960s was the Supreme Allied Commanding Europe . The group was formed in the wake of the Second World War .
 Colonel Bonesteel actively contributed to George Kennan’s concept for the containment of communism group plan . The military force option was always on the table during the Cold War .
 The American defense policy resulting from Project Solarium analysis reflected a change in military strategy from one of national crisis response and mobilization to one of alliances designed to persevere and forcibly respond economically and militarily over the attempted territorial expansion of communism . The U.S. military strategy was designed to
 National circumstances surrounding the Solarium task force were influenced by the nation’s preceding three years of active American fighting in the Korean War . President Eisenhower’ed budget reduction of annual military spending by five billion dollars from President Truman’�s budget, and the escalation of the
 Lemnitzer and Bonesteel’s insights and contributions to Project Solarium produced results which linked operational actions of concentrating national resources to the accomplishment of the strategic objective of defeating communism . The results of the project were linked to the goal of concentrating resources to defeat communism .
 Bonesteel served on the Planning Board of the National Security Council . Nomination letters between Eisenhower administration officials to serve on the board spoke very highly of his outstanding performance in past duties .
 NSC 162/2 was President Eisenhower’s New Look plan for national security to contain the Soviet threats with diplomatic, economic, and military actions . The plan was part of the New Look program to contain Soviet threats .
 NSC 162/2 involved rebuilding economic strength, maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent, and exploring other initiatives to counter communist expansion . The two overarching approaches involved rebuilding strength and maintaining the deterrent .
 Bonesteel began incorporating representation from each of the three military services in his planning for the president's presidency .
 Before this, only one Department of Defense representative had spoken for all branches of the military at the NSC Planning Board .
 Realistic feedback by the three service branches better enabled the National Security Council Planning Board to formulate and modify strategic policy by presenting options that were considered feasible, feasible, acceptable, and suitable .
 President Eisenhower’s yearly efforts to reduce the defense budget continued to affect Lemnitzer and Bonesteel . President Eisenhower continued to try to reduce defense budget .
 The lack of public support behind American involvement in the Korean War helped Eisenhower in his 1952 political campaign platform where he called for an end to the war . Eisenhower called for the end of the war in 1952 .
 From 1953 forward, the Eisenhower defense policy was oriented toward deterrence instead of the availability of conventional forces to deploy . From 1953 through the Eisenhower era, the policy was more focused on deterrence .
 Eisenhower’s ‘New Look’ budgets in the 1950s decreased the Army's personnel numbers from their Korean War peak of 1,596,000 to 873,000 by the end of the decade . Army personnel numbers dropped from 1,600,000 in 1950s
 The Kennedy administration allocated $20 billion in increased defense budget spending to the general-purpose ground forces in the military between 1961 and 1964 . The defense budget did not increase until the Kennedy administration .

 The expansion of the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command was a central focus to the development of a U.S. deterrent capability . The expansion was achieved by maintaining options to effectively employ nuclear weapons .
 The threat of nuclear weapons via aiipower became a method to deter the spread of communism instead of defending territory from communist insurgencies with U.S. conventional forces .
 Eisenhower’s ‘New Look’ placed primary reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent to general war with the Soviet Union . Eisenhower's 'New Look' was the result of his decision to use nuclear weapons in the Cold War era .
 The U.S. Army struggled throughout the 1950s to articulate the utility of limited force in the nuclear age . The United States Army was never comfortable .
 Lemnitzer reduced requirements to provide U.S. military defense forces to South Korea and Japan . He was the commander in chief of the Far East Command . He reduced requirements for providing defense forces in South Korea, Japan .
 Lemnitzer was the commanding general of United States Forces Korea, the Eighth Army, the Far East Command, and the United Nations Command . He was promoted to General and donned several leadership hats simultaneously as a commanding general .
 Lemnitzer played a critical role in his relationships and interactions with the South Korean President Syngman Rhee . His roles and responsibilities were many, but his critical role was in relationships with the president .
 Lemnitzer used relationships and experiences to design a plan to build and enhance the Republic of Korea’s defense force capability with American equipment and training . While incrementally decreasing the presence of American troops stationed in South Korea, the plan was designed to strengthen the country's defense force .
 Lemnitzer was commander in chief of the Far East Command in Japan . His plan was similar to the Japanese ‘National Defense Force’ for internal defense that had grown in strength to two-hundred thousand men during Lemnitz’s time .
 Exercise Sagebrush was conducted in 1955 at the Fort Polk, Louisiana maneuver area . Exercise was intended to demonstrate the efficiency of a proposed atomic organization structure the military services were considering for the future .
 General Lemnitzer shared the lessons learned from Exercise Sagebrush with South Korean President Syngmun Rhee to continue empowering the Republic of Korea defense forces . The lessons learned will continue to be shared with the South Korean president .
 The amount of money, personnel, and time devoted to Sagebrush did not produce the intended results of demonstrating the proposed atomic organization’s efficiencies . Instead, Sagebrush demonstrated its inefficiencies instead .
 The lessons was that the increased firepower of United States forces would allow a reduction in U.S. forces stationed in South Korea without decreasing deterrent capability of the forces that remained . The lessons were that increased firepower .
 The proposed atomic organization structure illustrated the dependence on atomic weapons due to its reliance on the employment of tactical nuclear weapons to destroy invading Soviet military divisions . Additionally, the proposal illustrated the reliance on nuclear weapons .
 Most North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries would not likely agree to the deployment of nuclear munitions on their soil due to the damages forecasted by detonating nuclear weapons . This structure was fundamentally and doctrinally flawed because most would not agree to deploy nuclear munitions in their soil .
 Nuclear proliferation also produced problems for the Soviets during the Cold War . Nuclear proliferation was also a problem for the Soviet Union in the 1950s .
 The Soviets broke away from nuclear interdependence support to their Chinese ally . China requested Soviet assistance in developing nuclear capabilities from the Soviets .
 This resulted in the Chinese developing their own nuclear weapons capability in 1964 . This led to the development of China's own own nuclear arms capability . The Chinese became the first country to develop a nuclear arsenal .
 The Sagebrush Exercise exposed the flaw in the Pentomic structure and organization it was intended to improve upon . It was meant to be an improvement in the organization's overall structure .
 His actions were critical to the establishment of the Japanese ‘National Defense Force’ and the Republic of Korea forces . His actions led to the creation of the National Defense Force and expanded their military capabilities .
 Building and enhancing these defense forces enabled the achievement of the American strategic goal of lessening its foreign defense force requirements and military budget costs in both nations . The U.S. has a goal of reducing foreign defense forces requirements in both countries .
 General Lyman L Eemnitzer was Vice Chief of Staff of the Army . General Lemnitzer’s contributions were numerous and facilitated the accomplishment .
 His achievements included putting the first American satellite into space . He also led efforts to develop the Nike-Zeus antiballistic missile for continental air defense .
 Lemnitzer accomplished these feats while under pressure to reduce defense budget spending, decrease Army force structure, and increase racial integration while under national scrutiny by the civil rights movement . The Army was under pressure from the White House to reduce budget spending and decrease force .
 The American military faced a continuous period of challenge during the 1950s of maintaining conventional force readiness to immediately go to war . The U.S. political body focused on reducing the defense budget and reliance on nuclear technology for deterrence .
 Several prominent general officers retired from the Army out of a sense of hopelessness that the political leadership was not supporting the advancement of military capabilities, but instead, was degrading military effectiveness and serving as a social test bed for desegregating America .
 Lemnitzer and the Army received increasingly negative attention from civil rights movement leaders and politicians in the 1950s due to the employment of active duty forces in maintaining security during crisis situations . The Army was criticized by civil rights leaders for employing active duty soldiers in crisis situations during the war .
 One of the best-known examples of this occurred at Little Rock, Arkansas, in the 1930s .
 The use of federal troops as a peacekeeping force during the integration process cast a national negative perception of the Army by the nation . Federal troops were used as peacekeeping forces during integration process .
 Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy instructed Lemnitzer in October of 1957 to take steps to put the first American satellite into space . The Soviet Union surprised America by putting Sputnik 1 into orbit .
 Budgetary pressures on the Army lessened during this period of research and development for achieving greater national prestige . Budgetary pressure on the army lessened in this period .

 Redstone Arsenal program could launch a satellite in four months in response to Lemnitzer’s order for an estimation of a satellite development and launch date . Trauschweizer, 66, was the commander of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency .
 Lemnitzer's pressure and support of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency’s satellite program enabled America to reach its strategic objective of launching a satellite into space on January 31, 1958 . The launch of a satellite was the first of its kind .
 Medaris was one of four prominent general officers to resign from the Army in 1960 . He did so based on his belief that space defense should have remained an Army mission .
 Lemnitzer’s staff planning actions facilitated the launching of the first American satellite into space . The Army retained control over the Redstone Arsenal and its rocket scientists . Lemnitz's staff planning . helped the launch of the . first American . American satellite .
 Lemnitzer’s desire for research into a long-range airborne capability to transport Army soldiers around the world resulted in the development of the C-141 airplane . The plane was developed in the 1950s and 1960s for the Army Air Force .

 Lemnitzer advocated the ‘forward strategy’ for quickly deploying tailored troop formations to specific conflicts instead of relying solely on nuclear deterrence options to prevent the expansion of communist controlled territory . Lemnitz advocated the 'forward strategy'
 Helicopters provided an important capability in the Vietnam War era for transporting troops and preparations for conducting air-to-ground anti-amor strikes against invading Soviet tank divisions . Helicopter was used to transport troops and prepare for air strikes .
 Increased American airlift capability enabled organizations with a mass transportation capability for effectively massing soldiers and resources at the decisive point on a battlefield . Increased U.S. airlift capabilities enabled organizations .
 The “dual capability” concept advocated by General Lemnitzer provided non-nuclear options to achieve strategic ends while continuing to advance the nation’s nuclear capabilities . Similarly, the ‘dual capabilities’ concept advocated for the U.S. also provided non
 The development of the C-141 supported the forward strategy doctrine with its strategic flexibility and agility combined with long-range lift transport capability . The aircraft was designed to be able to carry a payload of up to 100 tonnes .
 Lemnitzer promoted the development of a more technologically advanced rifle for the Army troops and continental ballistic missile defense . He also pushed for the development and adoption of more advanced rifles and ballistic missile defenses .
 The M-14 fired a less expensive cartridge in .308 Winchester caliber (7.62x 51mm NATO) with similar ballistics and lethality as the .30-06 Springfield caliber . The M14 fired the same cartridge as the 7.62mm NATO caliber .
 The Army changed the Ml Garand rifle to the M-14 . The new rifle significantly reduced the budget requirements for ammunition . It also increased the fighting capability of the ground soldiers .
 Lemnitzer was a catalyst to the development of the Nike-Zeus anti-ballistic missile in order to defend against the characteristic threat of attacks by Soviet Union intercontinental ballistic missiles . The Nike Zeus missile was designed to defend from attacks by the Soviet Union in the 1980s .
 His origins in the Coastal Artillery Coips may have been stoked with the revival of the necessity for a homeland defense from an enemy threat, albeit of another type .
 Lemnitzer’s accomplishment of magnifying the combat lethality for the Army soldier contributed to the achievement of the national strategic goal of decreasing the defense budget, he says .
 Lemnitzer was successful with his rationale in opposing the implementation in 1959 of Admiral Radford’s drastic Army personnel cut recommendation from 1957 . He also prevented the National Security Council from reducing the number of deployed Army forces by twenty-five percent .
 Lemnitzer successfully illuminated and justified the necessity of ground forces to prevent North Korean infiltrations into South Korean territory . Kim Jong-won: "Lemnitzer justified the need to ground forces"
 Ground forces were much more capable of protecting critical infrastructure than ground forces . Ground forces would be much more able to protect critical infrastructure, officials said . Ground troops were much better equipped to protect the infrastructure, they said .
 The Cold War threats by Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev of launching intercontinental ballistic missile at the United States justified the need for heightened American military capabilities .
 Khrushchev’s bizarre threats to attack the United States for its actions to protect free trade around the world repeatedly shocked Averell Harriman, the American ambassador to the Soviet Union and earlier ambassador to Paris as Chief of the Marshall Plan with Colonel Bonesteel .
 John Foster Dulles evolved from a massive nuclear retaliation mindset as the first line of Cold War national defense to a believer in the use of conventional forces in limited engagement conflicts . Dulles, the Secretary of State, evolved from the massive nuclear threat of nuclear retaliation to a belief in conventional forces
 This was partly due to the Soviet Union’s advancements in nuclear weapon capability increasing the likelihood of mutually assured destruction by both parties using nuclear weapons .
 The failure of the communist ideology in the Korean War and awareness of the nuclear capabilities . influenced Khrushchev to provide additional support to insurgent groups as they attempted to spread communism in Southeast Asia rather than employ conventional forces .
 Four prominent general officers retired due to their belief that President Eisenhower’s ‘New Look’ policies were overly degrading Army capabilities . During this time in the late 1950s, four prominent general . officers retired .
 The first to retire was General Matthew Ridgway in June 1955, the current Chief of Staff of the Army and former commander of the 82 nd Airborne Division during World War 11, due to his belief that conventional forces should be utilized to defeat Soviet forces, not nuclear strikes .
 Lieutenant General James Gavin, who commanded the 82 nd Airborne Division during World War 11, is the second to retire . Lieutenant General Gavin gained fame as the chief of Army research and development . He also served as the Chief of Army Research and Development at the time .
 Gavin’s reason for retiring in March of 1958 was due to his belief that space exploration should remain an Army mission . Gavin wanted to campaign as a civilian against the Eisenhower administration's ‘New Look’ policies that negatively affected the Army .
 General Maxwell Taylor was the third general to retire . General Lemnitzer gained national prominence for his actions during World War II . General Taylor was Chief of Staff of the Army .

 The fourth general officer to retire was Major General John Medaris in 1960 based upon his belief that space defense should have remained a mission for the Army .
 Lemnitzer was Chief of Staff of the Army during his time in charge of the U.S. Army in the 1960s and '90s . He is credited with his contribution to the flexible response concept . Lemnitzitzitz was a pioneer of flexible response concepts .
 The flexible response concept involved positioning military personnel and stockpiles overseas and stateside with the capability to rapidly deploy them to an initial crisis before a full conflict arose to involve nuclear weapons .
 A Soldier for His Time, mentions that Taylor resigned from frustration with President Eisenhower’s ‘New Look’ policies . Taylor resigned as a result of frustration with the 'New Look' policies .
 Lemnitzer continued to advocate for the benefit of the Aimy in a command climate that was anti-military growth while obeying the orders of the President and those appointed over him . Lemnitz continued to push for the better of his fellow officers .

 There was an underlying acknowledgement between the greater possibility of mutually assured nuclear destruction from nuclear proliferation and the want of increasing the frequency of limited war conflicts .
 Regional hegemon’s national infrastructure would not be destroyed while they conducted limited wars in remote territories no matter if they won or lost . A regional hegeman would not have destroyed his national infrastructure while conducting limited war in remote areas .
 Two studies concluded that reliance on nuclear arms diminished a nation’s ability to participate in international conflicts at levels lower than total war or prevent limited conflicts from escalating to total war levels .
 European leaders became more receptive to flexible response as a policy and more guarded to massive retaliation warfare when viewed in this context . European leaders are wary of massive retaliation wars when seen in the context .
 Many Army general officers and John F Kennedy believed Eisenhower administration’s dependence on nuclear deterrence had left the American military and Army unprepared for responding to situations smaller in size or scope than requiring nuclear strike capability . Many general officers believed the U.S. was unprepared for dealing with situations smaller
 He was a large supporter of Special Operations Forces in the undeclared wars against communism ideology . He was also a major supporter of the Special Forces .
 Kennedy increased the Special Forces branch of the Army by one-hundred and fifty percent and approved the ‘Green Beret’ as the official headgear during his short time in office .
 Kennedy believed the Army’s dual airlift and reserve force capacity would enable America to fight limited wars in Europe similar to the Korean War . Kennedy believed that the Army could fight limited war in Europe .
 Presidents Kennedy and Johnson’s emphasis on flexible response for defense policy instead of massive nuclear retaliation from Europe to Southeast Asia enabled a balance of power to be preserved .
 Robert McNamara established that American defense policy was not merely nuclear deterrence, but also flexible response . The newly developed C-141 airlift capacity to transport Army forces to crisis points around the world .
 McNamara believed a reliance on nuclear weapons technology for massive retaliation by the Eisenhower administration had handicapped the conventional force’s ability to respond to limited wars, he said . McNamara said reliance on weapons technology handicapped conventional forces’ ability to fight limited wars .

 Major General Bonesteel became the secretary to the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Lemnitzer, on March 1958 through September I960 . Bonesteels served as the Secretary of Staff for the Army from March 1958 to September 1958 .
 Lemnitzer advocated as early as May 1960 for developing and expanding the capabilities of the conventional force as a method for responding to limited conflict scenarios instead of responding with nuclear strike capabilities . Lemnitz: "Conventional force should be developed and expanded to respond to limited conflicts"
 Lemnitzer promoted conventional force capability for utilization as an other-than-nuclear-weapons response option in cases of limited warfare . He said conventional force could be used as an alternative to nuclear weapons response option .
 Conventional force capability to meet enemy threats with superior combat power while avoiding mutually assured destruction possibilities through employment of nuclear retaliatory strikes would be a viable response option .
 “Surviving the French Military Withdrawal’s” in Generals in International Politics, ed. Surviving a French military withdrawal,” is Generals In International Politics .
 Lemnitzer’s institutional coordination of the Single Integrated Operational Plan while Chief of Staff of the Army was a critical contribution for achieving strategic objectives with the military services . Lemnitzitzitz was the chief of Staff at the time of the US Army .
 The Single Integrated Operational Plan was developed between 1959 and 1960 . It was developed during a joint meeting General Lemnitzer called between the service chiefs .
 Lemnitzer’s purpose for the meeting was define each services’ offensive and defensive roles in strategic nuclear operations . The meeting was meant to define each service's roles in nuclear warfare . Lemnitz: "The meeting was defined as a meeting of the services' offensive and
 Lemnitzer’s insistence on the service chiefs meeting resulted in the Department of Defense establishing a unified plan for nuclear operations during the Cold War .
 Lemnitzer’s critical contributions while serving as the Chief of Staff of the Army produced the flexible response concept and Single Integrated Operational Plan . Lemnitzitzitzi's critical contributions produced the Flexible Response Concept .
 These two achievements provided tactical policy options for the services to follow in case of a breakout of nuclear, non-nuclear, limited, or general war to accomplish the strategic objective of defending the nation .
 Lemnitzer’s abundant contributions while serving as Vice Chief of Staff and Chief of . Staff of the Army contributed to the accomplishment of strategic missions, he says . Lemnitzitz' abundant contributions were his abundant contributions .
 Retaining Redstone Arsenal and its nuclear engineers under Army command enabled the continued advancement of missile defense developments . Retaining the nuclear engineers would have allowed the development of missile defenses .
 Advancing the acquisition of the C-141 airplane and integrating the M-14 rifle into Army inventories improved the capabilities, responsiveness, and the lethality of the American soldier .
 Nike-Zeus antiballistic missile improved continental air defense during the Cold War . Nike Zeus was developed in the 1950s and 1960s . Nikeeus was developed as part of an anti-air defense program .
 Lemnitzer’s leadership ability and personality enabled him to simultaneously accomplish these feats while under significant political pressure to reduce defense budget spending, sustain Army force size reduction and endure intense national scrutiny by the civil rights movement . Remarkably, he was able to accomplish this feat while under
 Many other prominent general officers were resigning from the Army out of a sense that their political leadership was not supporting the advancement of military capabilities . He provided strategic leadership while many other prominent generals were quitting .
 General Lemnitzer was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the course of the Bay of Pigs operation . He was one of the most prominent figures in the U.S. military during the operation in Cuba during the 1960s .
 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is to provide best military advice . He oversees individual service chiefs for recommendations to the President and National Security Council .
 Lemnitzer’s Chairmanship saw the election of President John F Kennedy to office and Robert McNamara as the Secretary of Defense . The beginning of Lemnitz's Chairmanship .
 Lemnitzer’s special assistant at the time the Bay of Pigs Operation occurred was Major General Bonesteel . Lemnitzitzitz was the president's special assistant . The operation took place in 1961 and 1962 .
 The Central Intelligence Agency’s team of planners did not write down their plans and planned only their individual portions of the operation in a decentralized manner in order to maintain secrecy . The CIA's team planned their individual parts of the mission in a decentralized manner .
 This method of planning did not produce an overall plan that was synchronized, feasible, or complete . This method was used to plan the construction of a complex complex project .
 Lemnitzer and the Joint Chiefs of Staffs assessments of the Central Intelligence Agency’s plan — and subject matter experts’ assessments — arrived at ratings of weak and unlikely of success . The Joint Chiefs’ assessment of the plan was based on intelligence experts' assessments .
 Lemnitzer and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were not able to offer their consultation to the final Bay of Pigs Operation plan . The Central Intelligence Agency continued to modify the plan as the D-Day approached .
 Lemnitzer’s repeated negative assessments of the Bay of Pigs Operation plan did not prevent the execution of the execution from occurring . As a result of the plan, Lemnitz's repeated negative assessment of the operation failed to prevent a strategic failure and embarrassment .
 President Kennedy summoned retired General Maxwell Taylor to investigate the Bay of Pigs Operation . Disappointed with Joint Chiefs of Staff advisors, President Kennedy ordered the operation .
 President Kennedy asked Maxwell Taylor to return to active duty status in a newly created position of Military Representative between the presidency and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
 President Kennedy’s action distanced General Lemnitzer further away from the presidency in the new chain of command and in a subordinate position to his previous boss who had retired from active duty due to his dislike of Eisenhower's New Look policies .
 Lemnitzer facilitated growth of the U.S. Army force structure under President Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs Operation and the post operation investigation . He led the development of the United States Army force in the aftermath of the operation .
 In May of 1961, the Army transitioned to the Reorganization Objective Army Division method for Army force structure . The method was designed to provide increased firepower, maneuverability, and flexibility .
 Three brigade headquarters now composed each division, instead of the five battle groups the pentomic division was based upon . The new division is based on three brigade headquarters instead of five battle group groups .
 Lemnitzer’s Chief of Staff of the Army predecessor, General Taylor, approved the pentomic division adoption in 1956 to prevent the decline in Army funding requirements by providing a need for self-sufficient conventional force strength .
 The pentomic concept was similar to the 21st century brigade combat team concept of incorporating brigade sustainment battalions into the force structure of the force .
 The memorandum communicated to the president that America was the preeminent military power of the world . It would support Kennedy in any manner he deemed fit to deploy its capabilities .
 Lemnitzer’s memorandum provided Kennedy with a confirmation that his country’S. military capacity was greater than any other in the world . Kennedy was discussing national strategic objectives with Khrushchev . Lemnitz's memo provided Kennedy a confirmation of his country's military capacity .
 Maxwell Taylor became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1962 . General Maxwell Taylor was the chairman of the joint chiefs of Staff . He was the first to be Chairman of Joint Chiefs in the Armed Forces .
