 The Kennedy administration harbored three great secrets in connection with the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis, not just two, as widely understood . The “Photo Gap” that Delayed Discovery of Missiles was the reason for the delay .
 The most sensitive, of course, was the quid pro quo that ended the acute phase of the crisis . It was the most sensitive to the end .
 President Kennedy publicly pledged not to invade Cuba and secretly committed to quietly dismantling Jupiter missile sites in Turkey in 1963 . In exchange for the prompt, very public, and veriﬁed withdrawal of Soviet missiles, President Kennedy agreed to quietly dismantle the sites . The sites were dismantled in
 Management of this secret was masterful, involving public dissembling, private disinformation and a plain lack of information . The quid pro quo remained a lively, but unconﬁrmed, rumor for nearly three decades .
 The second secret involved keeping a lid on Washington’s ongoing effort to subvert Fidel Castro’�s regime . The U.S. has been involved in the Cuban exile community for decades .
 Operation MONGOOSE, overseen by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, played a signiﬁcant role in fomenting the missile crisis . The operation fomented the crisis in the early 1960s .
 The covert effort was not part of the public discourse in 1962 and remained a secret in this country until the mid1970s . Yet that covert effort wasn't public discourse until mid-1970s, it was still a secret .
 Only after an unprecedented Senate probe into intelligence activities did enough information seep out to reveal that Castro’s fears of US military intervention were not wholly unfounded, however mistaken . Only after a Senate probe, it emerged that the fears were unfounded .
 The administration’s third secret, however, has proven to be the hardest to unpack . It was the administration's third secret . The White House has been accused of lying to the public .
 Kennedy administration “shot itself in the foot” when it limited U-2 surveillance for crucial weeks in 1962 . It took the government a full month to spot offensive missiles in Cuba .
 If proven, this “photo gap’s” threatened to tarnish the image of ‘wonderfully coordinated and error-free ‘crisis management’ that the White House sought to project before and after October 1962 .
 The administration’s anxiety over whether cover stories about the gap might unravel even trumped, for a time, its concern over keeping secret the quid pro quo . The administration was anxious about whether the cover stories might unravel .
 An oral assurance with the Soviets concerning the Jupiters could always be denied, while proof of the photo gap existed in the government’s own ﬁles . After all, an oral assurance was always denied .
 The photo gap remains under-appreciated to this day, notwithstanding the vast literature on the missile crisis . Largely because the administration labored mightily to obfuscate the issue, the photo gap is under appreciated . The vast literature is on the issue .
 Recently declassiﬁnally permit history to be ﬁlled in 43 years after the crisis . These same records alter the conventional story in at least one important respect, says historian .
 John McCone, the director of central intelligence, and the CIA as a whole were deeply distrusted by key administration ofﬁcials in the weeks leading up to discovery of the missiles .
 The rampant uncertainty that prevailed within the Agency, itself, has been downplayed, if not forgotten, to the detriment of depicting the complexity of what actually occurred . Moreover, the rampant uncertainty in the Agency itself has also been downplayed .
 The literature on the crisis has painted a rosier-than-warranted picture of how human intelligence, assiduously collected in September, overcame selfimposed restrictions on U-2 overflights .
 "What actually happened was not a textbook case of how the system should work," says CNN.com's John Sutter . Sutter: "It's not how it should work. What actually happened is not how to work"
 The tension between the CIA and the administration abated after the crisis, but it was not by very much . And although tension between them abated, it was only by a fraction of what it was initially .
 Lingering sensitivity over the photo gap left a chill in the relationship between the DCI and the Kennedy brothers, a result that can only be labeled ironic, given McCone’s role in securing the critical photo coverage . The Kennedy brothers' relationship was strained by the issue .
 For the first time in its short history, the CIA was being led by a man who was at direct odds with the administration he served . The CIA has a new leader in charge of the CIA .
 Liberals within the Eisenhower administration had been appalled by John McCone’s appointment in September 1961 . McCone was the stereotype of the wealthy, conservative Republican businessmen who had overwhelmingly populated the White House .
 As chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, McCone had acquired a reputation as a “militant” anti-communist . He promised to be diametrically opposed to the dominant ethos of the Kennedy administration . McCone was a "real alley runner"
 California engineer-turned-tycoon would likely have been a strong candidate for secretary of defense had Richard Nixon won the 1960 election . He would have been likely to be a strong contender for defense secretary .
 McCone regarded with deep suspicion by Democrats because of his Republican ties . Concerned that his stiff-necked anti-communism might distort intelligence produced by a demoralized CIA, still reeling from the failed invasion of Cuba .
 Opponents of McCone’s appointment had argued that he would be in a position to dominate intelligence in a city where information is often power . Opponents argued that McCone's appointment would allow him to dominate the intelligence community .
 Apprehension inside the CIA over the appointment matched the trepidation outside . The CIA has been under pressure from the public for months to get involved .
 It was against this backdrop of doubt and distrust that an untested DCI faced his first real crisis late in the summer of 1962 .
 The first of two U-2 over-estights of Cuba scheduled for August occurred on the ﬁfth, too early, by a matter of days, to capture any telling evidence about what would soon be an unprecedented Soviet military buildup .
 Reports from other sources prompted McCone to raise the specter of offensive missiles being emplaced, during a Special Group Augmented meeting on 10 August .
 McCone sounded the alarm again in Secretary of State Dean Rusk’s ofﬁce on 21 August, and while meeting with President Kennedy on 22 and 23 August . McCone: "We are going to find a way to get around the world. We are going
 The Soviet Union was “in the red [behind in terms of nuclear missiles] and knew it,” McCone reportedly averred . Khrushchev was likely to try to redress that imbalance, he said .
 The DCI did little to improve his persuasiveness, and much to enhance his Manichean reputation . But he promptly sugested staging a phony provocation against the U.S. base at Guantánamo .
 McCone was thought to be “too hardline and suspicious,” as Under Secretary of State George Ball later put it . He also thought he was too cavalier about the relationship between Cuba and the East-West faceoff in Berlin .
 The 60-year-old widower was to be married for the second time, before traveling to the French Riviera for his honeymoon . McCone left for the West Coast, where he was to attend a wedding .
 President Kennedy’s advisers would later scorn the DCI for supposedly not warning the president before leaving, and/or for being absent during a critical period . The DCI was accused of not warning President Kennedy before leaving .
 The claim was demonstrably false, but there probably was a marked difference between McCone’s dispatch of the so-called “honeymoon cables” in September and pressing his views .
 The two missions took place in August, both of which traversed the island . The mission was the first time the two missions were together .
 On 29 August, the second scheduled overﬁnight of the month occurred, after several delays due to bad weather . The second scheduled . scheduled over שּׁ�nally occurred on 29 August . August 29 .
 The SAM proved to be an SA-2, the same missile that had caused Powers’s U-2 to plummet to earth in the USSR in 1960 . It was the same SAM as the missile that caused Powers's plane to crash .
 Soon, it appeared, the CIA would not be able to overﬂy Cuba with impunity . The CIA would no longer be allowed to over-invasion Cuba .
 McCone reportedly observed, “They’re not putting them in to protect the cane cutters.” After being briefed, McCone said, ‘They”re not placing them in .
 The missile had been sent to other Soviet client states in the Third World . The same missile had previously been sent previously to Soviet clients .
 SA-2 deployment did not signal a foreign policy crisis in his eyes as much as it marked the onset of a domestic one, he says . Consequently, the South African Republic's South Africa policy is not a crisis in the country's foreign policy .
 With a midterm election fast approaching, internal political pressure to “do something’s about Cuba was bound to mount and had to be managed . With the midterms approaching, the pressure to "do something" about Cuba must be managed.
 The president became concerned about aerial reconnaissance of Cuba, and he was not satisﬁed until assured by the Joint Chiefs that the U.S. military would not be conducted in a provocative manner, he said .
 U-2 surveillance twice a month was left unaddressed, though not for long . These precautions left the vexing issue of intrusive U.2 surveillance once a month unaddressing .
 The next scheduled U-2 mission, on 5 September, detected additional SAM sites . The mission was scheduled to take place on September 5 .
 Acting DCI Carter described the "growing danger to the birds" in a cable to McCone . Coincidentally, the “growing danger” was underscored by two distant events .
 On 30 August, an air force U-2 had violated Soviet airspace for nine minutes during an air-sampling reconnaissance mission . On 9 September, a Taiwan-based pilot was lost over mainland China .
 Critics of intrusive U-2 surveillance say U.2 surveillance is intrusive . September over-the-ight of Cuba provided new ammunition to critics of surveillance .
 The State Department looked askance at U-2 missions over sovereign airspace . One longstanding opponent was the State Department . The U.2 missions were launched by the U.S. Air Force .
 At 10:00 a.m., McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser, made an out-of-channel request to James Reber, chairman of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance . Reber is charged with developing surveillance requirements for the U-2 .
 COMOR members found the third question so provocative that they wondered if they were really expected to comment on it . COMOR member: "I'm not sure if I'm expected to respond to the question"
 It represented resentments festering within the administration after the Bay of Pigs . But it was a sign of resentment against the US government .
 Bundy and Rusk believed that the CIA and the Pentagon had put Kennedy in an unfor unforgivable bind before and during the invasion of Cuba in April 1961 . The president’s own jaundiced view was that the U.S. government was in a bind .
 The two men, moreover, had been criticized severely for their own passivity at the time . The men's actions were criticized severely .
 Bundy and Rusk were hyper-sensitive about protecting the president from anything that smacked of another trap, especially when high-ranking military and intelligence ofﬁcials were scarcely concealing their determination to force the president “to atone for his restraint” during the
 When Reber pleaded for more time to prepare his answers, a high-level meeting was scheduled for 5:45m. in Bundy’s White House ofﬁce . Reber was scheduled to appear at a meeting with Bundy at 5:30m. Bundy�
 The national security adviser rescinded approval of the remaining September overﬂight, presumably to demonstrate that he was dead serious .
 The palpable tension between these two men almost overshadowed the substance of the meeting . "The palpable tension in the meeting was almost overshadowed by the substance,’s tension .
 Secretary of State worried that a U-2 incident would provoke two simultaneous uproars, one domestic and one foreign . The secretary of state worried that the U.S. would be condemning the United States worldwide . The U.2 aircraft crashed in a collision with a jetliner .
 Soviet propaganda had successfully managed “to turn U-2 into a kind of dirty word,” as one columnist later put it . The U.2 was a "dirty word" for the U.S. military .
 International opinion regarded the overﬂights as “illegal and immoral,” and even Washington’s staunchest allies found them unpalatable . Even the United States’ most powerful allies found the over-the-nightly measures “unacceptable�
 Rusk shrewdly argued that losing a U-2 over Cuba would compromise Washington’s unquestioned right to keep it in international waters . Rusk: Maybe offshore ﬂights were sufﬁcient anyway anyway .
 COMOR experts said interior areas of Cuba were unlikely to be covered . Interior areas are unlikely to have been covered, experts said .
 Only the 5 September mission, shown here, spent an extended amount of time in Cuban airspace . The mission was the only mission to spend time in Cuba .
 The paths of the following four ﬂights effectively precluded coverage of western Cuba and interior areas . The paths were also precluded from coverage of Cuba's western Cuba .
 In place of McCone, the Agency was represented by Carter, who lacked the DCI’s fearlessness and stature . Not only were they in the uncomfortable position of dealing directly with ofﬁcials who far outranked them .
 Administration ofﬁcials began drawing up paths that avoided known SAM sites . Experts retreated after administration drew up paths to avoid SAM sites, experts retreated .
 The political decision to desist from intrusive or risky overﬂights would be doubly crippling because of the vagaries of Caribbean weather . The region is beset by torrential rains and hurricanes from September to November, when the region is plagued by tropical weather .
 CIA made a habit of husbanding U-2 missions . The U.2 mission was a success story for the CIA . The mission was the first of its kind to carry out over-arrival missions .
 It was an operational practice to abort any mission if the weather was forecast to be more than 25 percent overcast . The mission was aborted when the weather forecast was more than a quarter of the time overcast.
 The 10 September decision limited the photographic “take” from every overﬂight, but had the unanticipated effect of drastically stretching out the mission schedule . Consequently, the 10 September . decision not only limited the . photographic ‘take’ but also stretched out the
 The result was a dysfunctional surveillance regime in a dynamic situation . The result of the surveillance regime is a dysfunctional regime in the U.S. government .
 The U.S. did not establish the missiles’ presence near San Cristóbal until nearly a full month later—15 October .
 Langley’s Unease Acting DCI Carter remonstrated on at least one occasion about the attenuation of U-2 surveillance . Langley's acting DCI said he was disappointed with the decision to reduce surveillance .
 Carter proved incapable of reversing the decision, especially after a 19 September Special National Intelligence Estimate reafﬁrmed the conventional wisdom . Yet Carter proved unable to reverse the decision .
 The presumption was that even if the Soviets dared to introduce SSMs, against all estimates, that would only occur after the SA-2 defense system was complete, which still appeared some weeks away . The presumption is that the Soviets would only use SSMs if they wanted to use them .
 An Agency ofﬁcer reportedly observed, perhaps harshly, that the acting DCI was “standing in quicksand which was hardening into concrete,” but didn’t even realize it .
 The moment when McCone learned about changes in the surveillance regime remains vague to this day . McCone says the moment when he learned about the changes is vague .
 The abrupt alteration in the U-2 regime went unmentioned in the cables . McCone did not realize the degree of overﬂights had been attenuated until he returned to Washington on 24 September .
 He was sufﬁciently concerned about the administration’s lassitude to button-hole Bundy in late September while the national security adviser was in Europe for a NATO function .
 Bundy was immovable, believing, as he did, that McCone was too ﬁxated on a single element of the geo-political strugle, the thermonuclear balance . Bundy believed, as did McCone, that he believed, that the balance of the
 The national security adviser remained determined not to allow McCone to entrap President Kennedy into sanctioning overﬂights with impunity . President Kennedy was determined to prevent McCone entraping him .
 Any shootdown would become a casus belli for those who were itching to invade the island . Any shoot-down would be seen as a case for those itching for invasion .
 McCone met with President Kennedy and the attorney general shortly after returning to Washington . He apparently was unable to reverse the administration’s ‘near-crippling caution,” as Richard Helms later termed it .
 Columnists like Walter Lippmann and James Reston were characterizing the surveillance of Cuba as “elaborate” or “total” in their columns . Simultaneously, inﬂuential columnists like Lippman and Reston characterizing
 By early October, McCone was determined to remove the strictures on U-2 surveillance as a matter of principle, believing that the CIA had already been ‘remiss’ in settling for much less than complete coverage .
 NPIC chief Arthur Lundahl had asked his staff to develop a visual representation of photo surveillance of Cuba since early September .
 Map shows that large portions of Cuba had not been photographed since late August . Map graphically depicted, at one glance, that large parts of Cuba were not photographed since August .
 The DCI “nearly came out of his chair when he saw the map,” Lundahl said . Lundahl says the DCI was ‘nervous’ to see the map of the area .
 The DCI and the attorney general were of like mind when it came to Cuba . Generally, the DCI .
 Senator Keating said the administration's reluctance to compromise with the White House is a problem . The White House has been criticized for being too cozy with the administration .
 McCone, presumably after pointing to Lundahl’s map, noted to the Special Group that there had been no coverage of the center of Cuba and more particularly, the entire western end of the Island for over a month . All ﬂights since 5 September had been either
 DCI objected strenuously to the limitations which had been placed on overﬂights . There arose a considerable discussion (with some heat) as to whether limitations had or not been placed by CIA .
 Now that the gaping hole in coverage was becoming obvious, no one was very keen to take responsibility for it . No one was keen to blame for it.
 SGA as a body, of course, had not issued an edict in writing against intrusive overﬂights .
 CIA and COMOR had desisted from submitting such requests after being told, in effect, that such ﬂight paths, if proposed, would not be approved . Rusk and Bundy had been under duress from Rusk, Bundy .
 President Bundy could technically claim that he had approved every overﬂight request received since the SA-2s were discovered in late August . Bundy later would say that he approved every request received by the president since the discovery .
 The 4 October meeting began nudging the surveillance regime in the direction that McCone was determined to move it . McCone is determined to make changes to surveillance regime .
 Alexis Johnson, still managed to win agreement for a National Reconnaissance Ofﬁce report on an overall surveillance program for Cuba, to be presented at the next SGA meeting on 9 October .
 NRO pondered whether there was a substitute for the U-2 . That meant several more days lost while the NRO mulled whether to replace it .
 McCone met with Bundy privately to discuss Cuba . It was not clear that the White House would ultimately agree to remove the strictures on U-2 overights .
 The White House still viewed the unprecedented buildup as a domestic, rather than foreign policy, crisis . White House views the buildup as domestic, not foreign policy .
 CIA ofﬁcers at the operational level were correlating new human intelligence reports about alleged missiles in Cuba . Separately, McCone’s effort to lift restrictions on principle was also under way .
 Ted Shackley, chief of the CIA’s station in Miami, wrote a report on 7 September . Shackley had grabbed the attention of Shackley and Task Force W .
 In secret writing, the agent conveyed information about a mountainous area near San Cristóbal, Cuba, where "very secret and important work,” believed to involve missiles, was in progress . The agent had conveyed information .
 The agent’s report coincided with two refugee reports that described large missiles last seen heading west from Havana .
 Task Force W ofﬁcers would have simply funneled the human intelligence up to COMOR, where a new requirement could be fashioned . Under normal circumstances, task force would have just funneled human intelligence .
 Since 10 September, enormous uncertainty, and even a kind of defensiveness, had developed within the CIA over U-2 ﬂights . Sam Halpern, Task Force W’s executive ofﬁcer, believed it advisable to avoid having only the CIA
 He worried about it being discounted as the product of a politicized, overly agressive, or simply unreliable Agency. He worried that it would be discounted as a political or overly aggressive .
 John Wright, head of the MONGOOSE component at the Defense Intelligence Agency, was invited to a brieﬁng in Task Force W’s war room . Wright is the head of a unit at the Department of Defense .
 CIA ofﬁcers in Task Force W had marked off a trapezoid-shaped area on a map . They asked Wright to push a request for U-2 surveillance up his chain of command .
 The maneuver “got us out of the line of ﬁre and let DIA take the lead” in early October, Halpern said . The maneuver got the U.S. out of line and let the DIA lead, he said .
 Wright and the very junior DIA would forever be credited with having astutely assembled the crucial intelligence . Wright and his DIA were credited with leading intelligence on the Soviet Union .
 By this time, the last two missions authorized on 11 September had ﬂown without any evidence of offensive missiles .
 McCone came to the meeting armed with a quick paper, prepared by the Ofﬁce of National Estimates, on the consequences of a presidential declaration stating that the Soviet buildup necessitated invasive reconnaissance of Cuba .
 DCI had also taken the precaution of inviting along an air force colonel who could testify about the vulnerability of a U-2 during an intrusive sweep .
 The SA-2 sites were fully equipped by now, but from the American perspective they were still not functioning as an integrated SAM system . The U.S. military says they are still not working as integrated SAM systems . The SA2 sites are fully equipped, but not fully functioning as
 No one single-mindedly maintained that the 10 September restrictions had to be lifted to allow photo coverage of suspected surface-to-surface missile site .
 COMOR had simply put the San Cristóbal area at the top of its target list if overﬂights of western Cuba were approved . DIA’s urgent recommendation had been made by DIA .
 The SGA’s recommendation to the president (which he approved promptly) eased the restrictions on overﬂights but by the most incremental margin imaginable . Ultimately, the president approved promptly .
 If mission “did not provoke an SA-2 reaction,” additional in-and-out ﬂights over western Cuba would be proposed, until a full mosaic of that region was obtained . If mission did not provoke reaction, additional in and out ﬉ights
 The track of the mission was plotted to include coverage of the San Cristóbal trapezoid . The mission was approved on 9 October . The track was plotted for the mission .
 The ﬁlm was rushed to Suitland, Maryland, for processing and arrived at NPIC on the morning of 15 October . It was taken to the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.
 It was a “moment of splendor” for the U-2, its cameras and ﬁlm, and the photo-interpreters, as Sherman Kent later put it, if not the CIA’s . CIA‬�nest hour
 The president issued blanket authority for unrestricted U-2 over-ights on 16 October . The missile crisis commenced in earnest in October .
 The performance of the Intelligence Community has to be judged a success, albeit by a narrow margin . Ultimately, the performance of this intelligence community has been judged to be a success .
 The fact that the SSMs were detected and reported before any of them were perceived as operational was vital to the resolution that followed . It was vital that the fact that they were detected was reported before they were perceived to be operational .
 Washington had precious days to deliberate, and then orchestrate a reaction short of an instant military attack . Washington has a long way to go before a possible military strike, but not an instant attack .
 Kennedy administration seized the initiative via a quarantine . The Kennedy administration never lost it .
 Khrushchev was denied the fait accompli he had tried to achieve by deception . He was forced to improvise in a situation for which he had not planned sufﬁciently, if at all . The incident was the first time Khrushchchev had been
 This “system worked” view has been endorsed by every participant in the crisis who has written a memoir, as well as by most scholars of the crisis . This "system worked" view is endorsed by all participants, including scholars, who say it worked .
 Most one can expect is a kind of doged performance by an intelligence service that somehow manages to prevent a strategic surprise . And it may well be that, given the intangibles of human behavior, the most one can ever expect, is that the most .
 Some students of missile crisis have gone too far, raising a counterfactual argument to claim that the CIA’s misestimates were the most signiﬁcant shortcoming, and that the photo gap, in essence, did not even matter .
 This is probably not the most appropriate counterfactual argument to pose, given that the missiles were found none too soon . The missiles were probably too soon, given the fact that they were found soon after .
 If some combination of the administration’s caution, more active Soviet radars, mechanical problems with the aircraft or cameras, or inclement weather had delayed discovery by as little as a week to 10 days . The sighting would have correlated with a judgment that some SSMs were already capable
 The administration’s restraint in the face of a blatant Soviet deception/provocation won allied and world opinion over to the U.S. position very quickly . It was the administration's restraint .
 Some missiles, when discovered, were simultaneously deemed operational . That restraint might have been sorely tested .
 The looming mid-term election helped deﬁne what the administration saw as its window of opportunity for a negotiated settlement . Then, too, the looming midterm elections also helped .
 Shortening the amount of time left before the 6 November voting sugests that the missile crisis might have played out very differently . Appreciably shortening the . amount of . time left . before the . November 6 November vote sugestues that the . missile crisis may have played
 President Kennedy’s determination to avoid an armed conﬂict remained ﬁxed . He might have had to settle the crisis on less advantageous terms, such as an explicit exchange of Soviet offensive weapons in Cuba for the Jupiter missiles .
 "What actually happened, of course, matters more than what might have been," says CNN.com's John Sutter . What actually happened matters more, he says .
 The photo gap was more signiﬁcant than the consistently wrong estimates, too .
 The failure to anticipate Khrushchev’s gamble, to be sure, was a serious mistake that warranted ex post facto study . It was an important mistake that required ex-post facto study.
 As one scholar of the analytical process has perceptively written, it really should not have mattered “what intelligence ‘thought’” about the likelihood of missiles being introduced into Cuba, it should have mattered .
 The photo gap far exceeded the misestimates as a genuine political problem for the administration . It is indisputable, in any event, that the photo gap is a political problem .
 President Kennedy faced the uncomfortable prospect of explaining why his administration had degraded the only intelligence-gathering tool that was indispensable until it was almost too late . Although no one inside the executive branch had been exactly complacent, President Kennedy .
 The photo gap left the president vulnerable to charges, reasonable or otherwise, that he had been taken in by the Soviets’ elaborate deception, to a point where the administration tried to foist a false sense of security onto the country .
 ExComm members discussed how to create the impression in public that the administration had been as vigilant as advertised, and that the missiles had been discovered at the earliest reasonable moment . Well before a settlement of the crisis, ExComm .
 Deﬂecting congressional curiosity, not to mention skeptics in the media, promised to be a delicate problem .
 On 5 September, acting DCI Carter had informed senators on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees that the CIA was in no way “assuming” that SSMs would not be implanted in Cuba .
 On 17 September, Rusk gave similar assurances about the administration’s vigilance and the quality of intelligence being gathered . “ we do have very ﬁrm information indeed, and of a most reliable sort,” he said .
 Kenneth Keating, the president’s congressional nemesis, helped push the notion that the missiles had been discovered at the earliest reasonable opportunity .
 Keating's supposedly superior intelligence tended to obfuscate the genuine issue in the weeks leading up to 14 October . The media’s subsequent ﬁxation over Keating’�s supposedly superior Intelligence tended to obscure the issue . Keating was convicted of a federal crime
 The photo gap, in other words, was obscured by a controversy . Keating’s ostensible ‘scoop’ was truly a red herring . The photo gaps were obscured by the controversy .
 The last aspect of the photo gap is the effect the secret had on the all-important relationship between the nation’s chief intelligence ofﬁcer and the president, in this case .
 McCone's prescience did not win him admission into the president's innermost circle of advisers . McCone’s prescience didn’t win him admirality .
 The DCI became mightily resented, not only for having been right, but also for being privy to an embarrassing truth . "The DCI was not inclined to let anyone forget for a moment"
 McCone’s loyalty and ambition were such that the DCI went along with the decision to find the missiles as early as possible . Ultimately, he fancied himself a successor .
 The Kennedys now distrusted their DCI more than ever, as revealed by their private conversation on 4 March regarding a Marquis Childs column on the photo gap .
 The White House was upset that someone other than the White House put out a version of what happened . The column did not actually contradict the administration’s public position, but the mere fact that someone else put out what happened incensed the Kennedys .
 According to Robert Kennedy, Childs was claiming that the CIA was putting out information against the administration, trying to make itself look good . Robert Kennedy: Childs said the CIA wanted to make the administration look good. Robert Kennedy says the CIA put out information about the administration .
 Apart from clarifying key dynamics on the eve of the missile crisis, the photo gap is interesting because it speaks to issues of moment today, not the least of which is the difﬁculty of being the nation’s chief intelligence of
 Telling the president and his top advisers what they prefer not to believe, or advocating a risk they want to avoid, is not a job for the faint of heart . The White House has been criticized for its handling of foreign policy .
 The run-up to the missile crisis may not represent the model behavior Hughes had in mind . But, decades later, the government seems as far removed from Hughes' prescription .
 At critical junctures U.S. policymakers still receive and absorb the intelligence they prefer rather than need . The United States failed to act against alQa’ida in the 1990s and the misappropriation of estimates about Iraq in 2002 .
 The recent establishment of a director of national intelligence, in and of itself, is not likely to ameliorate this problem . The establishment of an intelligence director does not help, writes CNN.com's John Sutter .
 Republicans coined the term ‘photo gap’ after the infamous (and non-existent) “missile gap” in 1960 . Democrats had exploited that gap to good effect in 1960s .
 Explanations for and/or dismissals of the photo gap are as varied and voluminous as the literature on the missile crisis itself .
 A thorough historiography would be instructive, but is beyond the scope of this article . A thorough Historian would be more useful .
 Ofﬁcial document compilations and a history separately released by the CIA began to build an authoritative record in the 1990s .

 Inhibitions placed on the distribution of intelligence provide a telling measure of how the crisis was initially perceived . The U.S. government's response to the crisis has been largely limited to limited intelligence .
 Distribution of raw intelligence was normal until 12 October, when it was restricted to U.S. Intelligence Board members . Distribution was normal .
 McCone’s August proposal about staging an incident at Guantánamo reﬂected the “invasion-minded mentalities” prevalent in intelligence and military circles, he says .
 Carter had gone into the meeting intent on reinstating the second September overﬂight . Carter had hoped to add a third extended mission before the end of the month .
 President Kennedy insisted that the CIA complete the schedule of approved missions before requesting new overﬂights . President Kennedy always insisted that he always insisted on completing the schedule .
 The Air Force’s chief of intelligence, Robert Breitweiser, wondered if a pilot-less “Fireﬂy drone” might substitute for the U-2 .
 Someone around the table sugested that “Remember the Drone” would not be as gripping a battle cry as ‘Remember the Maine’ had been in 1898 . “The Maine” had been a popular battle cry in 1898.
 On 20 September, Carter asked for a reconsideration of the 10 September decision, but Rusk easily deﬂected Carter’s effort . The decision was overturned on 10 September .

 Soviet commanders were not allowed to activate the system earlier because the SAMs had been emplaced to defend against an air attack against the missiles, not reconnaissance aircraft . Gribkov says the system was not activated earlier because SAMs were emplaced in place to defend from air attack .
 As late as December 1962, the DCI remained perplexed about exactly what had happened during his absence .
 No minutes of the 26 September meeting are extant, but this may have been when McCone made a “strong representation to President Kennedy to remove some of the restraints on operations over Cuba,” Richard Helms says .
 McCone also had an unrecorded conversation with the president on 8 October . McCone may have pressed his case then .
 The Cuban buildup “is a conﬁguration of defensive capability,” Rusk said during a rare, nationally televised interview on 29 September . Rusk says the Cuban buildup is a “conשּׁnication of defense capability”
 Rusk intensely disliked both columnists, so their private source was almost certainly Bundy . Bundy, acting on President Kennedy’s instructions, was likely to have acted on his orders .
 The White House and State Department were critical of the CIA’s apparent inability to collect high-value human intelligence on Cuba . The CIA was criticized for relying on technical means such as the U-2 .
 DIA’s request informed memos submitted to the COMOR, USIB, and NRO in early October . DIA requested the memos .
 The 7 October over﬉ight skirted what would turn out to be the SSM complexes in central Cuba . Photo-interpreters were unable to detect any sites, presumably because of the oblique coverage .
 McCone was apparently loath to make missions or ﬂight paths contingent on human intelligence reports . He was deadset on lifting restrictions on principle .
 The logic behind the SGA’s recommendation may have been perceived differently by others by others . The SGA's recommendation may be perceived differently .
 Known SAM sites were identified as known and suspected SAM sites; coastal cruise missile installations; and, third, SSM sightings that required conﬁrmation or denial .
 The administration was anxious to preserve “plausible deniability” in case of an incident . The U-2 mission was shifted from the CIA to the Strategic Air Command .
 A cover story involving a regular air force pilot was deemed marginally more credible . It signiﬁed how dread of another U-2 incident was still greater than any concern about SSMs .
 George termed Intelligence Community’s performance a “nearfailure” of the “ﬁrst magnitude” in Deterrence, 473 . George termed the Intelligence Community's performance a nearfailure .
 Gil Merom, “The 1962 Cuban Intelligence Estimate,” Intelligence and National Security 14, no. 14, was published in 1962 . The Cuban intelligence estimate was published by the CIA .
 The pre-14 October intelligence product was “deﬁcient due to operational, as much as analytical, reasons,” Merom says . “It was ‘de-de-decided” for operational reasons, he says .
 The president's preference for a limited objective, i.e., the removal of offensive weapons rather than an invasion of Cuba, was achieved . The president said he wanted to remove offensive weapons from Cuba .
 The president was prepared to authorize the so-called “Cordier ploy,” if direct negotiations failed to produce a settlement . The president has said he is not satisfied with the situation in the country .
 This scheme envisioned a public quid pro quo ostensibly proposed by the UN secretary general . This scheme was supposed to be part of the UN Secretary General's plan . The scheme was intended to be a public exchange of trust .
 At the same time, the inﬂuence of National Intelligence Estimates can be overrated . National intelligence estimates are often overrated, but not overstated .
 Policymakers tend to embrace estimates that “validate their own certainties,” as one leading scholar has noted . Policymakers often choose estimates that validate themselves, as one scholar says .
 James Burnham, “Intelligence on Cuba,” National Review, 20 November 1962 . Burnham: Intelligence on Cuba was ‘intelligence on Cuba’
 Russell shrewdly asked McCone when congressional leaders were briefed about the SSMs on 22 October was whether the SAMs were operational . Russell: One of the ﬁrst questions Russell asked was whether they were operational?
 Another red herring was the speculation in the media (and rumor on Capitol Hill) that the administration allegedly knew before Keating but withheld the information so as to maximize the electoral gain from Moscow .
 The misestimates, which became public knowledge almost immediately, also drew attention away from the nearfailure to collect intelligence . Finally, the misestimate, which was public knowledge, drew attention to the near-failure of intelligence .
 McCone was deliberately kept in the dark about the secret quid pro quo, despite openly advocating a public trade of Jupiter missiles during ExComm meetings .
 McCone’s exclusion here may have had more to do with his relationship with Eisenhower and other Republicans . McCone's exclusion here, however, may have been due to his friendship with Eisenhower .
 Kennedy intended to disinform the former president about the true parameters of the settlement . The truth was impossible for Kennedy to tell McCone the truth .
 McCone’s continued hard line on Cuba and some clashes with Defense Secretary McNamara over the Soviet withdrawal caused some teeth-gnashing in early 1963 .
 If photos had been taken earlier than mid-October, McCone testiﬁed, they probably would not have been suf ﬁciently de﬉nitive . If photos were taken earlier this month, they would have been more positive .
 Marquis Childs, “Blank Spot in Cuban Picture,” Washington Post, 4 March 1963 . Childs: ‘Blank spot in Cuban picture is blank spot’
 McCone said the photo gap was being used to drive a wedge into the administration . The president said the CIA would pit the CIA against the State and Defense Departments .
