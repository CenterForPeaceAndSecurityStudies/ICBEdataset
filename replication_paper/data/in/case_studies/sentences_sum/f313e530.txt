 The nation was founded as a constitutional republic, one whose governmental powers were extremely limited . The nation's government is limited to very limited powers .
 The Constitution was designed to make clear that the government’s powers were limited to those enumerated in the Constitution itself . The idea of using the Constitution to bring the federal government into existence was to make it clear, he says .
 Due process of law, right to counsel, grand-jury indictments, trial by jury, search and seizure, cruel and unusual punishments, bail, speedy trial are all expressly addressed, reflecting how important they were to our ancestors . In the age of national security, all of those protections
 The term isnâ�s even found in the Constitution . National security has all been trumped by the concept of national security . The term is used to refer to the National Security Council .
 One searches in vain for some grant of power anywhere in that document relating to ânational security.â’s” It isn’t there, he says .
 The government now wields omnipotent powers under the rubric of •national security,” the author says . With the exception of libertarians, hardly anyone questions or challenges it, including those who profess an ardent allegiance to the Constitution .
 The Constitutionâs Interstate Commerce Clause is an example of the Commerce Clause . Consider, for example, the interstate commerce clause . The Supreme Court is weighing up on the issue of immigration reform .
 We have the government coming up with a concept known as ânational security,â�™ which it has then used to adopt powers that would otherwise violate the Constitution . The government has then adopted powers that are otherwise violating the Constitution, he says .
 Itâs as if national security has been made the foundation of the nation, the author says . The author says national security is the nation's "foundation"
 National security is one of the most meaningless, nebulous, nonsensical terms in the English language, but, at the same time, the most important term in the lives of the American people . All the government has to do is say ânational security,â�
 If the government says that national security is at stake, that’s the end of the story. If that's the case, thatâs not the case. The government says national security at stake is at risk, that's end of story .
 Federal judges will immediately dismiss lawsuits as soon as the government claims that national security is at stake . Congress will immediately suspend investigations when the government says national security has a stake .
 The Justice Department will defer to the national-security establishment when it raises the issue of national security . National security, a term not even in the Constitution, trumps everything .
 Those two entities have done more to transform American life than anything else, even more than the welfare state . The welfare state has transformed American life more than any other thing, says President Obama .
 When Americans read that the Soviet government rounded up its own people and sent them into the Gulag, they recoil against the exercise of such totalitarian powers . Americans recoil from such totalitarian power, but recoil from the exercise .
 North Korean government has tortured people within its prison system . They have the same reaction when they hear that they have tortured people . North Korea has a history of torturing its prisoners .
 The Chinese government has arrested and incarcerated people for years without charges or trial . But when the U.S. government does such things or even just claims the authority to do them, the mindset of the average American automatically shifts .
 It can’t be evil for the U.S. government to wield such powers because the agents who are wielding them are Americans, not communists . It canâ�s not evil, it can”s been evil for Americans to wield powers
 In fact, another fascinating aspect to all this is the mindset of those within the national-security establishment itself, says CNN's John Defterios .
 Even though they are wielding the same kinds of powers that are wielded by totalitarian regimes, the last thing in their minds is that theyâre doing anything evil or immoral . The last thing they�â�™t think of them are evil is doing anything
 In their mind, theyât’re fighting evil in order to preserve security and freedom . In their minds, the terrorists are fighting evil to preserve their freedom .
 President Obama says the U.S. has to do some unsavory things, but those things are necessary to preserve the nation . Obama: "Sure, they have to do . Sure, they must do . But those things must be done to preserve our nation."
 Americans are safe and free because of things theyâre doing, and we’re supposed to be grateful . After all, as advocates of the national-security state often remind us, the Constitution is not a suicide pact .
 If measures have to be taken to preserve the nation are inconsistent with the Constitution, then so be it, says President Obama . "So be it," he says. "If it's necessary, it's a good thing for the nation to preserve its security"
 When officials in totalitarian regimes round people up without charges, incarcerate them indefinitely, torture them, and execute them, what they are doing is evil . Thus, when officials in authoritarian regimes round up people without charges and imprison them, they are evil .
 Officials within the U.S. national security state do those same things . They look upon themselves as good and the citizenry look upon them in the same way . They are doing it to advance freedom and to preserve national security of the United States .
 Some foreign totalitarian regimes are considered evil while others are considered good . For example, some foreign regimes are seen as evil, while others as good .
 In the U.S. national-security establishment, they are considered to be evil totalitarian regimes . But then consider, say, Egypt, which has been ruled by a brutal military dictatorship for nearly 30 years . Egypt is a totalitarian regime that wields the same kind of totalitarian powers that
 For decades, Egyptian military and intelligence forces have rounded people up, taken them to prison camps for indefinite detention, tortured them, and executed them . The U.S. national-security establishment has long looked on the Egyptian military dictatorship as good, because of its close relationship with the U
 The U.S. government has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in money and armaments to Egypt to help fund its totalitarian military dictatorship . Egypt has been close cooperation between the national-security apparatuses of both nations .
 Egyptâs national-security state even agreed to serve as one of the U.S. rendition-torture partners . The relationship enables United States officials to send a kidnapped victim to Egypt for the purpose of torture .
 Iran was considered a threat to U.S. national security in 1953 . In 1953, Iran was seen as a potential threat to United States national security .
 The CIA engaged in its first regime-change operation, ousting Iranâs democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, from power . For the next 25 years, Iran was considered good, notwithstanding the fact that the shahâ�™s regime was
 CIA helped him and his national-security establishment to oppress the Iranian people, he says . "In fact, the CIA even helped him," he says. "Even in fact, he helped him"
 When Iranians revolted against the domestic tyranny that the U.S. national-security state had foisted upon them, Iran became an evil regime . The new regime wasn't doing anything different than the shahâs regime had done. The U.N.
 During the 1980s, Iraq had a brutal totalitarian regime headed by Saddam Hussein . Saddam Hussein was a dictator who ruled the country for decades .
 It was considered a good regime because it was friendly to the U.S. national-security state . Nonetheless, it was considered to be a 'good regime' for the United States .
 When Iraq invaded Kuwait, the U.S. national-security establishment reclassified Iraq as an evil regime . Later, when Iraq invaded Iraq, the United States reclassified it as a bad regime . The U.N. national security establishment later classified Iraq as evil regime.
 Today, Iraq is headed by a democratically elected regime that exercises the same totalitarian powers that Saddam exercised, but itâs considered to be a good regime because it’s perceived to be on the side of the U.S. national-security state .
 One of the most demonstrable examples of the turn that America took toward empire, militarism, and the national-security state has involved Cuba . Letâs start by focusing on Cuba, the author says .
 The U.S. government has maintained an embargo against Cuba for more than 50 years . That small nation 90 miles from American shores encapsulates the effect that such a turn had on the American people .
 The aim was to cause massive economic suffering to the Cuban citizenry â privation, poverty, and even starvation . The aim of the Cuban government was to inflict economic suffering on its citizens .
 The idea was that Castro would be removed from power either by a citizens’ revolt, a military coup, or abdication by Castro himself . The plan has never succeeded, but undoubtedly U.S. officials, 50 years after the embargo was instituted, are still hoping that it
 While there have been those who have objected to the embargo, even from its beginning, by and large the American people have deferred to the authority of their government .
 A few years after the Cuban embargo was instituted, the U.S. government declared its âwar on poverty,â�™ a domestic war whose purported rationale was a deep concern for the poor in society . The embargo against Cuba was instituted by the
 If national security required the government to inflict great suffering on the Cuban people, then that’s just what would have to be done .
 Nothing could be permitted to stand in the way of protecting national security, whatever that term meant . Nothing would be permitted in the U.S. to protect national security . President Obama has been in office since 2001 .
 National-security establishment knew what national security meant and had ultimate responsibility for protecting it . For their part, Americans were expected to remain silent .
 No matter how much suffering the Cuban embargo inflicted on the Cuban people, it wasnâ’t something over which most Americans troubled themselves . The Cuban people suffered from the embargo, but most Americans didnâ�™t think about it .
 U.S. officials had determined that national security necessitated the imposition of the embargo, that was all that mattered . The embargo was imposed by the United States on behalf of national security .
 While the embargo was ostensibly an attack on the economic well-being of the Cuban people, it was, at the same time, an infringement of the economic liberty of the American people . The embargo also abandoned traditional American values of private property, free enterprise, and limited government .
 The embargo made it a federal criminal offense to spend money in Cuba without a license from the U.S. government . People have a fundamental, God-given right to travel wherever they want and dispose of their money .
 If an American was caught violating the embargo, the U.S. government would prosecute him criminally or sue him civilly or both . That was precisely the sort of economic control that Castro was wielding in Cuba as part of his embrace of socialism .
 In the attempt to oust Castro from power, U.S. officials were imposing the same kinds of socialist controls on the American people that Castro was imposing on the Cuban people . Most Americans remained silent .
 If U.S. officials determined that it was necessary to adopt socialist methods in order to protect national security, that was sufficient justification to surrender an important part of economic liberty . That was enough justification for surrendering economic liberty, the author says .
 American mindset throughout the Cold War was even worse than that. The end justified the means. In fact, the U.S. mindset throughout that. was worse than . that.
 It wasnâ’t as though Americans viewed their government as adopting evil or immoral means to protect national security . Americans werenâ�™�s view of the U.S. government as immoral or immoral .
 The viewpoint was that whatever was being done by U.S. officials to protect national security wasnâ��t evil or immoral at all . Instead, the view was that the actions were not evil, immoral or immoral .
 The mindset was that even if the U.S. government was employing the same methods being employed by the communists, such methods were good when employed by United States officials . The mindset, both in and out of the United States government, was that such methods would be good for U.
 Assassination is murder, an act that is considered a grave sin under Judeo-Christian principles, according to the Bible . Assassination was murder, a crime considered a crime under the law of God .
 Assassination is something that our American ancestors recoiled from as something objectively bad . Assassination was once something that Americans thought was bad, but it's not bad .
 When the Constitution called the federal government into existence, the power to assassinate was not among the enumerated powers delegated to it . The power was not included in the Constitution when it was created .
 As a condition for accepting the federal government, the American people demanded the enactment of the Fifth Amendment . The Fifth Amendment prohibited the government from depriving people of life without due process of law . All those principles went out of the window when it came to Cuba and the Cold War .
 The national-security establishment engaged in numerous assassination attempts against Cubaâs president, Fidel Castro . Fidel Castro was assassinated by the Cuban government .
 The CIA repeatedly tried to murder him, in a variety of ways . It shouldn't surprise anyone that U.S. officials justified their assassination attempts under the rationale of national security .
 Americans were expected to not question or challenge what the CIA or the military was doing in the name of national security . The end â the preservation of national . security justified the means of assassination, the author says .
 Americans understood that the national-security state was doing things that had to be kept secret from them . It was as if a pact had been implicitly entered into between the American people and the officials of the U.S. national security state .
 Under the pact, U.S. officials would have the power to do whatever they felt necessary to protect national security, such as assassinate foreign officials . The pact would give the United States power to kill foreign officials, kill or assassinate them .
 Such things would be kept secret from the American people so that their conscience wouldnât be troubled over the unsavory things that U.S. officials were doing to protect national security . Americans would defer to the authority of their government and defer to it .
 What mattered, first and foremost, was the preservation of national security . Even if U.S. officials were doing unsavory things, such as assassinating people, such things were not evil because they were being done by United States officials to protect national security.
 "When the communists assassinated people, that was something bad. That is, when . That is when ... that is something bad," he said .
 If CIA officials determined that it was necessary, on grounds of national security, to partner with the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro, then it was considered okay from a moral standpoint . If it was deemed necessary, the CIA officials decided it was OK to work with the mafia to assassinate Castro,
 Once the Mafia united with the CIA to assassinate Castro that action was considered to be good . Moreover, while the other things the Mafia was doing were considered bad, the assassination was considered good .
 The hope was that the assassination of Castro would bring into power a ruler who would be subservient to the U.S. government . The assassination attempts werenât the only way that the CIA was trying to effect regime change in Cuba .
 The efforts at replacing Castro with a proUnited States ruler began with the CIAâs invasion of Cuba . The Bay of Pigs invasion was a CIA project that had originated under the Eisenhower administration .
 From the very beginning, the operation was based on a lie, one that the national-security state intended to sell to the American people . From the beginning of the operation, the truth was out of the truth, the author says .
 The plan called for U.S. officials, including Kennedy, the military, and the CIA, to lie to the American people about the role the CIA played in the invasion . Even though the CIA was orchestrating the invasion, the plan was to lie .
 Official lying became an established principle under the national-security state . U.S. officials intended to falsely tell everyone that the invasion was carried out by Cuban exiles .
 If U.S. officials had to lie to protect national security, so be it, it's OK, says CNN.com's John Sutter . The White House has been accused of covering up the truth .
 The U.S. government was doing it for the sake of national security . Deception was considered necessary and good, but deception was not considered necessary .
 There were also U.S.-sponsored terrorist attacks in Cuba, in which CIA-supported operatives would bomb or sabotage Cuban businesses, farms, and industries . Only deception on the part of others, such as the communists, was considered bad .
 One of the most tragic events during the Cold War period involved the terrorist downing of a Cuban airliner over Venezuelan skies . National security was all that mattered .
 Dozens of people were killed, including the members of Cubaâs national fencing team . Dozens were killed in the attack, including dozens of members of the team .
 There isn't any direct evidence that the CIA was behind the attack, but there is no doubt that the people who did commit the attack had the same mindset as the CIA . The United States government has steadfastly continued to harbor a man accused of orchestrating the attack .
 For years, the Venezuelan government has sought the extradition of Posada to Venezuela to stand trial for the murder of the people on that plane . The Venezuelan government, with whom the United States has an extradition treaty, has sought Posada's extradition .
 The United States government has continually refused to honor the extradition request . The U.S. government has repeatedly denied the request to extradite him .
 It should also be noted that Posada was convicted in Panama of trying to assassinate Fidel Castro . The act was considered to be a criminal offense in Panama .
 The CIA wasnât the only branch of the national-security state that was committed to effecting regime change in Cuba . The U.S. government has provided him with safe harbor, preventing his extradition to Venezuela . He was later pardoned by Panamaâ�
 The United States military establishment was committed to achieving that goal . The U.S. military establishment is also committed to doing that .
 One of the most fascinating and revealing aspects of the military mindset during the Cold War involved a Pentagon plan known as Operation Northwoods . The purpose was to provide a justification for U.S. forces to effect regime change in Cuba through a military invasion .
 It also called for fake Cuban agents to commit terrorist attacks within the United States, possibly involving the loss of innocent lives to make it look good .
 The plan also called for the hijacking of an American airliner that would fall off the radar screens and be replaced by a pilotless drone . The drone would crash into the sea, making it look as though the airliner itself had crashed .
 Plane would then be secretly flown back to a base in the United States . Plane would be flown to the base in a secret location in the U.S.
 The point of all this deception was to provide an excuse for ordering a military invasion of Cuba . Ominously, the plan didnât explain how passengers would be released back to their families if they were thought dead .
 The idea was that the U.S. would simply be responding to a Cuban attack rather than aggressing against Cuba with an unprovoked invasion of the island . Under the plan, the Pentagon was obviously calling on the president to deceive the American people and the world .
 The Pentagon expected Kennedy to go on national television, falsely tell the American people that America had been attacked by Cuban terrorists, thereby necessitating a U.S. invasion of the country . Kennedyâs everlasting credit, he rejected Operation Northwoods .
 Their crime entailed the transmission of U.S. ânational defense secrets to Cubaâ�™
 Judge Reggie B Walton berated the Myerses for what they had done . As part of a plea bargain, he received a life sentence and she received a prison sentence .
 They told the judge that long ago, they embraced the philosophy of communism and socialism and the principles of the Cuban revolution . They said they embrace the philosophy and socialism long ago .
 They said, We did not act out of anger toward the U.S. or from any thought of anti-Americanism . They said they said they acted out of no anger toward America . They also said they were not angry at the United States or against it .
 "Our only objective was to help the Cuban people defend their revolution," he said . "We were there to help defend the revolution," the Cuban president said .
 Hillary Clinton ordered a comprehensive damage assessment to determine how U.S. national security may have been harmed by the Myerses’ action . The case shed light on the national-security state for the past 70 years .
 The judge never seemed to question or challenge the U.S. governmentâs conduct towards Cuba since the 1959 Cuban revolution . For one thing, the judge didn't seem to question the United States .
 He seemed to have just automatically concluded that since the Myerses had delivered classified ânational defense secrets to Cuba, that was the end of the matter . That was the case, he said .
 Cuban officials already have the information, but the U.S. government won't release it to the public . Under principles of ânational security,â�™ the United States government won’t disclose that information, which seems odd .
 Cuba has never taken any aggressive actions against the United States. But whatever the information was, it couldnâ�’t have had anything to do with â�€�™s national defenseâ�™™ .
 The truth is that it was the U.S. national-security state, and specifically its determination to invade Cuba, that precipitated the crisis . The United States national security state is responsible for the crisis in Cuba, the author says .
 After the Bay of Pigs disaster, the Pentagon and CIA became determined to get rid of Fidel Castro and replace him with a proUnited States stooge . Hereâs what really happened.
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously presented a plan to invade Cuba to John Kennedy . John Kennedy was the president of the United States in Cuba in 1961 .
 Operation Northwoods called for attacks on U.S. soil, on refugee boats leaving Cuba, and on the United States military facility at GuantÃ¡namo Bay . It is one of the most shocking proposals in the history of the U. States national-security state .
 Under Operation Northwoods, real people were to be killed, including Americans . In actuality, they would be U.S. personnel falsely portraying themselves as Cuban agents . The operation was called Operation Northwood .
 The president, who, of course, would be in on the scheme, would go on national television, look into the camera, and inform the American people that Cuba had attacked the U.S. The president would then tell the nation that Cuba attacked the United States .
 One of the most fascinating aspects of Operation Northwoods was the belief among the Joint Chiefs of Staff that such a wide-ranging conspiracy could and would be kept secret from the American people and the world for a very long time .
 As it was, no one who was privy to the plan, including the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, ever talked . No one who knew about the plan ever talked about it .
 To his credit, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods . The idea, which has always been a guiding principle for the national security state, was that the end justified the means .
 The Pentagon and the CIA continued to support an invasion of Cuba . But that didnâ�t dissuade them from continuing to support the invasion .
 The chatter about invading Cuba reached both Cuba and the Soviet Union . While Castro’s forces could defeat a small force of Cuban exiles, a full-fledged military invasion of Cuba was another thing altogether .
 In their minds, the missile crisis was proof positive that the president should have accepted their proposals for invading Cuba in the months prior to the crisis . In the months preceding the crisis, the Cuban missile crisis led to the Cuban crisis .
 The military and the CIA viewed the missile crisis as an opportunity to effect regime change in Cuba through force . The Cuban missile crisis was the perfect excuse for regime change, the author says .
 The CIA even sent sabotage teams into Cuba in preparation for the invasion without the knowledge or approval of the president . The CIA used the CIA to send sabotage teams to Cuba without the president's approval .
 The military raised the nuclear-alert level to the second-highest possible level and let the Soviets know about it . Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to extricate themselves from the crisis .
 As Soviet records later documented, nuclear missiles had already been installed and made operational, with authority given to commanders in Cuba to fire them in the event of a United States invasion of the island .
 If Kennedy had done what the Pentagon and the CIA wanted him to do, full nuclear war would have been the result . The Myerses were delivering classified information to Cuba during the past 30 years . The U.S. national-security state brought America and the Soviet Union to a nuclear
 The U.S. has never engaged in terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage in the United States or overseas, not even at GuantÃ¡namo Bay . The United States has not engaged in any terrorist attacks in the U.N. or overseas .
 The group has never attempted to assassinate U.S. officials or anyone else on American soil . It has never tried to assassinate anyone in partnership with the Mafia, anyone else . The group says it has never been involved in an assassination attempt .
 The U.S. has never implemented an economic embargo against the U.K. It has never imposed an embargo on the United States .
 Cuba has never tried to effect regime change in the U.S. It has been the United States government that has done all those things to Cuba, CNN's John Sutter says . Cuba has not tried to change its regime, he says .
 The Cuban government has repeatedly tried to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials . It has even entered into a partnership with the Mafia to do so .
 It has maintained a brutal economic embargo against Cuba for more than half a century . Cuba has maintained an embargo against the U.S. for over 50 years .
 The information had to have pertained to the United States government�âs acts of aggression toward Cuba, that is, to plans relating to assassination, invasion, terrorism, or embargo .
 In their minds, they were simply giving information to Cuba to enable it to defend itself from U.S. aggression, they said . In their mind, the information was simply giving .
 In their minds, the U.S. government should simply have left Cuba alone . But, you see, for Judge Walton and for officials in the United States national-security state, American citizens are never supposed to think like that .
 Americans are not supposed to make judgments on right and wrong when it comes to the actions of their government . Under the principles of the national-security state, Americans are supposed to be not allowed to make right or wrong decisions .
 The job of the national-security state is to keep Americans safe . Theyâre supposed to defer to the authority of their national security state officials, without question .
 They are the ultimate judges of what national security means and what must be done to protect it . The U.S. House of Representatives is the ultimate judge of national security in the world .
 If they say itâs necessary to invade a sovereign and independent country, to assassinate its officials, to enter into an assassination partnership with organized crime, to engage in terrorism and sabotage within the country, then that’s just the way it is . All Americans
 The Myerses made a mistake in delivering the information to Cuba, which placed them in violation of U.S. laws against spying and treason . Under the principles of the national-security state, government and country are conflated into one entity .
 Judge Walton would undoubtedly have still berated them if they had been convicted . Moreover, judge Walton would still berate them even if they were convicted .
 Another example of this phenomenon is the case of the Cuban Five . But at least the information would have reached the American people, which might have caused more Americans to exercise some independence of thought and personal conscience .
 The case involves five agents of the Cuban government who were arrested by federal officials in the United States . They were prosecuted for spying, convicted, and sentenced to long prison terms .
 Imagine the audacity of those five men in trying to protect their country from terrorism . Imagine the courage of these five men to protect themselves from terrorism.
 Cubana Flight 455 took off from Venezuela on October 6, 1976, and was returning to Cuba . The plane was flying from Venezuela to Cuba when the plane crashed .
 CIA claimed that he was no longer working for the CIA during that time . We do know that he and the CIA claimed he was not working for them . We also know he was a CIA operative .
 There really is no way of knowing what happened, but they would say that anyway, so there really can't know for sure . But the problem is that they would have said that anyway .
 U.S. government has steadfastly harbored Posada by refusing to honor an extradition request from Venezuela . Venezuela has an extradition treaty with the United States, but Posada is still wanted .
 If they had delivered such information to Cuba, there is no doubt that they would have been treated in the same way they were treated for transmitting the â�national defenseâ�™ information that they actually transmitted to Cuba .
 Fidel Castro’s refusal to submit to the control of the U.S. government and the fact that Castro was a communist who turned Cuba into a communist state . Those concepts have been driving principles of United States foreign policy towards Cuba .
 The day after Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, they invaded the Philippines, where they killed or captured tens of thousands of American soldiers . They have also wreaked untold damage on our nation, our values, our economic well-being, and freedom .
 The answer lies in the turn towards empire that the United States took during the Spanish-American War in 1898 . The U.S. took the step towards empire in 1898, and it took it to become an empire .
 When Cuba and the Philippines revolted against the rule of the Spanish Empire, the U.S. intervened in the conflict . Americaâs intervention succeeded in the war .
 Cuba and the Philippines failed to secure their independence . Nonetheless, the two countries failed to achieve independence .
 When the Cuban people revolted against Batista and replaced him with Castro, U.S. officials hoped that Castro would continue to place Cuba and himself under United States control . United States officials hoped he would continue the tradition and place Cuba under the United States .
 Castro made it clear to the U.S. empire and to the Cuban people that Cuba was, for the first time in history, to be a sovereign and independent country . That hope, however, was soon dashed, as Castro made clear .
 The empire placed him squarely in its sights for a regime-change operation . The operation would ultimately consist of an economic embargo, an invasion, assassination attempts, terrorism, sabotage, and almost nuclear war .
 U.S. imperialism and anti-communism became the twin driving forces of the United States government in the second half of the 20th century . After seizing power, Fidel Castro quickly began converting Cubaâs economic system to communism . The Cuban dictator was a communist
 U.S., Great Britain, France, and other non-Soviet Allied powers did not win the war . But when âweâ�™ is defined to mean the United States, Great Britain and France, it did not .
 It was the Soviet Union that won the war. Great Britain declared war on Nazi Germany. The Soviet Union was the ostensible reason for the war .
 The Polish people were indeed freed from Nazi tyranny, only to have to suffer for the next 50 years under Soviet communist tyranny . Well, the Polish people had to suffer under Soviet communism .
 Fear of communism was about 1,000 times greater than the fear of terrorism is today . Terrorists fear communism 1,00 times greater today than they fear terrorism . The fear of terror was 1,500 times greater in Soviet-era Russia .
 While terrorism involves a physical act of force, communism involved more than that . What was different was different, however, was that while terrorism involves physical force, Communism involved more .
 Communism also involved an idea, one that absolutely scared the U.S. officials and much of the American populace to death . The idea of Communism also scared the United States officials .
 There were several aspects to the anti-communist fervor . One was the notion that the Soviet Union intended to initiate a war against the United States in which America would be conquered by the communists .
 A second aspect was the notion that communism would spread beyond Cuba, into other Latin American nations, which would enable them to mobilize military forces that would invade Florida and Texas and sweep up the Eastern seaboard . Under that scenario, the American people would end up living their lives much like
 All five aspects of the anti-communism mindset combined to produce a climate of constant preparation for war . Under this scenario, communists would begin winning elections all across the land and gradually begin to seep into the federal bureaucracies, enabling them to bring communism to America .
 Communism is an economic doctrine in which the state owns the means of production . Communism is a doctrine that says the state is responsible for the production of the products .
 In its purest sense, it means that the state owns everything in society . In the pureest sense, this means that state owns all in society, says the author .
 The state guarantees that everyone will be taken care of with housing, food, employment, health care, education, and other important things . "The state guarantees everyone will have a good life," says the author of the book .
 No more worries about losing oneâ�’s home, starving to death, being fired, or being unable to pay for medical expenses or for an education . No more . worries about . losing your home, starve to death or being fired .
 Everyoneâs needs are taken care of, from the day they are born to the day of the death . The world is full of people who take care of their needs from birth to the end of life .
 This ordered a withdrawal of 1,000 troops out of roughly 16,000 U.S. troops stationed in Vietnam by the end of 1963 . The complete withdrawal of troops from Vietnam was ordered by the US in 1965 .
 The memorandum also authorized open-ended covert operations against North Vietnam . The memorandum was signed by President Nixon .
 President Johnson used the Gulf of Tonkin incident to obtain congressional authorization for a drastic escalation of the war . This, in turn, he used the incident to get congressional approval for war escalation .
 Declassified in 1997, this lengthy document has been called the most corrupt plan ever created by the U.S. government . Invading Cuba is a lengthy document called the 'most corrupt plan'
 On March 13, 1962, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted this secret plan to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara . The plan was intended to justify an invasion of Cuba by means of terrorist actions against the U.S.
 The committee recommended to the Justice Department that the case be reopened . The committee also recommended that the investigation be reopened.
 Liberty Lobby published an article by former CIA officer Victor Marchetti in its magazine, The Spotlight . The CIA's role in the assassination â was revealed in 1978 .
 Marchetti stated that E Howard Hunt, also a former CIA officer, was involved in the JFK assassination . Hunt was also a CIA officer . Hunt is a former FBI agent .
 Former CIA asset Marita Lorenz testified that E Howard Hunt was in Dallas the day before the assassination . Lorenz said Hunt delivered sums of money to a group of men that included Frank Sturgis of Watergate fame and Jack Ruby .
 In August 2003, former CIA agent E Howard Hunt lay dying in his Miami home with his son, Saint John Hunt, at his side . Hunt's son: "E Howard Hunt is the son of a former CIA operative. Naming names is a way of life," Hunt said .

 Korean War veteran Albert Orozco set out to prove himself with other Mexican-American vets on a new battlefield â� politics . In 1960, he set out with Mexican-Americans on a mission to take on politics .
 He doesnât let the surveillance eclipse the significance of the activism, he says . He says, "I’m not afraid of the surveillance, but I’ve never been afraid of it"
 By one account, 91 percent of Texas Mexican-Americans voted for JFK . The clubs saw how important it was to get involved in the voting process, Orozco said .
 He and his late wife, Henrietta, co-hosted the first Viva Kennedy meeting in the Old East Dallas home of his mother . âFor the first time, after the efforts of the GI Forum, they saw the results of the results,â

 I appreciate the opportunity to address the Board today and appreciate the time you are spending going to the public for information . Good afternoon. Good afternoon . I, too, appreciate the opportunities to address you today .
 One of the theories of the assassination revolves around the possibility that there may have been some involvement by persons with experience in the U.S. intelligence community . An intelligence unit of the United States Army was present and on assignment in Dealey Plaza just before, during and immediately after the assassination
 In 1992, an individual claimed to have been very near Dealey Plaza during the assassination . To the best of his knowledge, information on this unit has not been released publicly .
 CNN's John Sutter says he had a difficult time believing the man's story . Sutter: "As a researcher, this immediately caught my attention, and I began to question this gentleman about the experience"
 Even though I had personal experience with some of the devices and the techniques that this group used, I was still very skeptical, as you may be also . I was skeptical of the techniques and was very skeptical of some of them .
 The story is about the Army Station in Fort Hood, Texas, in Clean, Texas . But with further investigation I convinced myself that it technically could have been accomplished .
 On the day of the assassination his group, a communications group, was assigned the task of observing and videotaping the presidential motorcade as it moved through the Plaza .
 If this event actually occurred, if it actually happened, it makes their activity highly suspicious and adds new questions to the assassination . This unit had no similar assignment in any other Texas city during the President's visit, and they were only to tape that portion of the motorcade .
 The camera signals were transported by wireless means back to the control studio, which was actually a semi-tractor-trailer . After discovering that the camera . signals were sent by wireless .
 I knew that ham radio operators have been sending television signals easily for a number of years, and I had also participated in that hobby . Ham radio operators were able to send TV signals easily with ham radio signals .
 I started to research available equipment to see if this story had any possibility of being true . I have another handout that I would like to give you. I started researching available equipment .
 In the question and answer, I can relate his entire story, the following information was obtained over approximately three separate conversations with this individual . Now that we know that equipment existed in 1963, and I can tell you a little bit about the equipment, if you would like, in the question
 "I had extracted a verbal consent to get his story on videotape, but when the time came for doing so, his attitude on the matter had completely reversed" "I am only left today with the recollection, you know, the notes that I had taken from the conversation and the
 The signals from the cameras were sent back to a semi-tractor-trailer acting as a mobile studio . The studio was parked a short distance from the Plaza Plaza .
 Each camera had a preview monitor and videotape machine associated with it inside the trailer recording the view of each camera . Each camera was connected to a separate camera inside a trailer recording each other .
 Each videotape position had a single person responsible for its proper operation . There was no sound recorded in this assignment .
 Each position these men occupied was shielded from the others so that they could only see the preview for their individual camera . Each position were shielded from each other so that the preview was shown .
 About 15 minutes after the assassination, a group of men appeared who identified themselves as FBI agents . Each man saw the assassination occur from a different perspective of their monitors .
 Each man was put on a bus which had been summoned to the scene and they were driven back to their base .
 Finding that there was equipment available in 1963 that would do this made it easier for me to accept the story I have just related to you . Upon their arrival, they were simply told to forget it.
 All these things collectively make me believe that this unit in Dealey Plaza was an intelligence unit . At one point, he mentioned to me that he was allowed by a letter from the military to discuss some things in relation to his duties on the day of the assassination .
 CNN.com's John Sutter says he has found additional evidence that the event occurred . Sutter: "Still, one important step in my investigation was to find some additional evidence"
 There is some possible photographic evidence of this communication group being in Dealey Plaza that day, and I would be happy to provide you with further information on that if time allows at the end of my presentation .
 An attempt should be made by the Board to locate the tapes and request that another government agency attempt to get the exact electrical format determined . A video machine should be constructed to bring their images to view .
 The Dallas Field Office of the FBI and Bureau Headquarters may have information or be in possession of the tapes . Duplication to modern day formats would then make the tapes available publicly .
 If the men who seized the tapes were not real FBI agents, then CIA, military intelligence and other splinter groups should be checked . If there remains an estate of the late J Edgar Hoover, they may have some information or be in possession of the tapes .
 I would inquire of Mr E Howard Hunt, if he is still alive, as to his knowledge of the tapes and their subsequent disposition . Also, I would ask of Mr Howard Hunt as well, as well as Mr Hunt himself .
 There exists a possibility that he may even have them in his possession . The records at Fort Hood may be key to finding documents supporting this activity .
 There seems to be a problem of gag orders that I would like to address also, and the fact that this individual I had interviewed had received notification that he did not have to continue to keep certain things confidential is further indication that there continue to be individuals who continue are under an obligation of
 There appear to have been several instances of this happening to individuals required by military order or other Executive Branch order not to discuss any details of the assassination . Many have not written of their experiences or granted interviews to members of the media or the research community .
 If our government is serious about full disclosure of all facts surrounding the assassination, he will rescind orders, prevent them from being renewed and allow a complete compilation of personal records .
 As distasteful and wild as the thought is that the American intelligence community could be involved in such an event, I hope the Board will keep an open mind . This will allow the Review Board to further fulfill and properly perform its congressionally mandated task .
 Your work may be the last attempt to bring to the light of day this dark deed, so it is vital for you to question everything you find . If any intelligence personnel were involved, it is their profession and they are very adept at covering up any evidence of their involvement in any activity
 In any operation that U.S. intelligence personnel are involved in, we would expect them to be able to complete their missions with expert precision . We would expect the Americans to be involved in any operation they were involved in .
 "We would expect that they would be able to cover up their involvement as an agency and our involvement as a nation if the nature of the task so dictated," says the British government .
 I would like to make a comment in relation to the Board's mandate . Please keep this in mind as you ponder the information brought to your attention .
 Some in the U.S. government are concerned that releasing assassination records could compromise intelligence methods used by the intelligence agencies in covert operations .
 President Kennedy's assassination may have been carried out using covert methods, says author . He urges the Board to consider that many of these covert methods were used to carry out the assassination .
 If this assassination was accomplished by Americans from the intelligence community, they have betrayed their agencies and the U.S. public, he says . "They have not only betrayed the citizenry of this country by taking from them their President, but they have also betrayed their agency and the United
 Mr Osborn indicated that information you had gathered from a subsequent independent investigation helped you in forming your conclusion that there was an intelligence unit in Dealey Plaza . Mr. Osborn, in your testimony, indicated that he had gathered information from a later independent investigation .
 "I have not made any attempts at that because I believe the story so thoroughly," she said . "I believe it so thoroughly that I have not tried to make any attempts"
 I felt that if I were to make any attempts to confirm any of this or search for the tapes that those things might be destroyed, because these tapes - if you would like to discuss the photographic evidence, there is one that would probably show a shooter behind the stockade fence, so
 Mr Chairman, with that in mind, I would like to pose to you a set of questions, if I may, and you can cut me off if I get too long-winded here, as I am sure you will . Mr Chairman Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman .
 "I have been researching for approximately the last 15 years, not quite, and have mostly focused my investigation on identifying the man who fired the fatal head shot . I have not had any type of military experience, so I probably approach this a little bit differently as a citizen that would like
 "I believe that he thought that he had originally been saying things he could, and then the way that he froze up -in fact, I have had several individuals that have done that, I feel that he may be guilty of some sort of violation," says President Obama .
 If the President were to rescind all those orders, I would be happy to provide his name, he would say yes . I would also provide the name of the person who rescinded the orders .
 The only thing that I really did was, from the conversations that we had, I prepared a list of questions, because I do have a technical background, I have been in electronics since I was 14, ham radio, and television . I doubted in my senses that this could be done
 If you would look at the cameras, this is a fully transistorized camera . This is the first time a camera has been captured by a camera inside a camera .
 The device was available in 1962 by a company that regularly supplied the military with all kinds of camera equipment . It comes with a backpack transmitter so that you don't have to have a cable going back to a videotape recorder .
 You also indicate on page 5 that he had mentioned to you that he was allowed by a letter from the military to discuss some things in relation to his duties on the day of the assassination . If you will document it, that would be helpful .
 I was going to ask that individual for that document in the videotaped session, but because he cut everything off, I was not able to actually view that document . I will probably seek some counsel on that to ensure that I, myself, do not get into a situation here that may
 The intelligence community has at their disposal, shall we say, executive privilege, and the rules are a little bit different when dealing with these type of people because they can claim national security . National security a lot of times can mean more than one thing .
 It can mean security of our nation from its people being held in arms over something that the government or people within the government have done, he says . "They really use the term national security quite widely, so I think they really use it quite widely," he adds .
 "We don't know if these persons were really involved, and they may be saying that these are operatives that we can't afford to let their names go," police chief says . So that is a gray area, he says .
 I would like to ask this question with respect to the letter that this young man received saying what he could say about his activities . The young man was sent a letter saying he could not say anything about the letter . The letter was sent to the young man by a young man who was
 "I never got into the exact details. Yes, this was a number of years later that these things were no longer - that certain things, and I didn't get into the details," he said .
 "I just assumed that the things that he was telling me were things that I could know," she says . "He told me that he could know. I just assumed ... that he would be telling me," she adds .
 The public hearing will stand in recess until the hour of 2:00m. We will return and reconvene at that time . Thank you, Mr Osborn .
 Cyril Wecht made one of his wonderful passionate speeches, confirming the progress that we have made in the past, with the enactment of the JFK Act, which released millions of documents providing some transparency .
 Wecht stated that there are not enough young people investigating this case . Oliver Stone echoed that sentiment, also echoed by Wecht .
 Most Americans have no idea that the case was never closed, in the City of Dallas . The case never closed in the city of Dallas.
 Sabato reached this conclusion after considering 50 years of evidence, even while debunking a conspiracy theory put forth by a House committee in 1979 . Sabato also debunked the conspiracy theory in 1979, even though it was debunked .
 Alternative theories cannot be put to rest because of discrepancies and inadequacies in the initial response to the assassination, Sabato says . The autopsy was performed at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland, not in Texas as required by law .
 Sabato: "The Warren Commission did not do a thorough job when the trail was hot" Sabato says the Warren Commission was not thorough enough to look at the trail when it was hot .
 It is virtually impossible 50 years later to put all of the pieces back together, says CNN.com's John Sutter .
 All evidence suggests that Oswald killed Kennedy, but some clues suggests that he may not have been the only assassin . Some of these theories may never be put to rest .
 Dr. Robert McClelland, a physician in the trauma room of the hospital where JFK was taken, contends that the wound he saw was consistent with a shot from the grassy knoll . He says the wound is consistent with the shooting from the knoll.
 Oswald became friends with an international man of mystery named George de Mohrenschildt, who had ties to U.S. intelligence and the State Department . Oswald also had connections with a man who killed himself before testifying before he could testify to the House Committee on Assassinations .
 Oswald left Dallas not long after the Walker shooting, and went back to his hometown, New Orleans . Oswald was in New Orleans, April-September '63, when he was killed .
 He wrote to Vincent Lee, the national director of the left-wing Fair Play for Cuba Committee, about setting up a New Orleans branch of the organization . Once there, he wrote to Lee to set up the organization's New Orleans office .
 Oswald introduced himself to the New Orleans DRE delegate Carlos Bringuier, saying that as an ex-Marine he wanted to train anti-Castro Cubans in guerrilla warfare .
 Oswald handed out pro-Castro FPCC literature on Canal Street . Bringuier declined this offer, and was then surprised, a few days later, to discover Oswald handing out literature . Oswald was a member of the FPCC .
 An FBI agent, John Quigley, who was familiar with Oswald's defection to the USSR, was sent along . The FBI agent is familiar with the defection of Oswald .
 Oswald told Quigley about how he'd heard of the New Orleans chapter of the FPCC, and then decided to join it . Oswald is a member of the N.Y. FPCC .
 Oswald appeared compromised as a closet Communist and suspect tool of Moscow . Oswald appeared to have been compromised by the Soviet Union . Oswald was accused of being a Communist Party member .
 Marina and June went back to Irving, and Lee obtained a tourist permit for Mexico . The Odio Incident, September '63, occurred in late September .
 Oswald's bus arrived in Mexico City at 10am, 27 September, the hour his bus arrived . This incident did not sit well with the Warren Commission's timeline, and certainly the meeting could not have taken place too close to 10am .
 Silvia Odio was living with her sister Annie in Dallas . They were the daughters of Amador Odio, who was jailed in Cuba as the leader of Junta Revolucionaria Cubana .
 Oswald tried to inflitrate Bringuier's DRE in New Orleans in August . Oswald was seen at a Dallas DRE meeting on 13 October . infiltrating JURE in Dallas as well is not outside the bounds of possibility .
 'Second version' of the Odio connection does not match with Connell's account, and this was Silvia's own version, given to the FBI and the Warren Commission . But the 'second version' doesn't match with the original version of the story .
 The American man with them was introduced as 'Leon Oswald' and he 'stood quietly by, saying almost nothing at all' 'Leon' stood quietly by and said 'almost nothing' at all . The American with them were introduced as Leon Oswald .
 Leopoldo was looking for her help to raise funds for violent anti-Castro operations . He asked her for help raising funds to help fund violent operations against Castro .
 He could do anything like getting underground in Cuba, like killing Castro says we Cubans don't have any guts . He could . kill Castro, like kill Castro. says we . say we . have no guts .
 Amador Odio corresponded with his daughters, and was suspicious when he received a letter from Silvia about these men, whom he suspected were not JURE members . Odio suspected the men were not members of JURE .
 The Warren Commission wrote to J Edgar Hoover stating that 'It is a matter of some importance to the Commission that Mrs. Oswald having two associates is a bit inconvenient' Mrs. O. Oswald had two associates .
 Odio's allegations either be proved or disproved', the FBI managed to produce one Loran Eugene Hall . Hall was found dead at the scene of the alleged shooting .
 Oswald and the CIA, more than any other book, has attempted to make sense of it all . Hall, Howard and Seymour denied they ever met Odio . Hall recanted his story, but the Warren Commission ran with the convenient Hall version .
 Newman decides that the best guide to real events is to combine transcripts of CIA surveillance at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City with statements from Silvia DurÃ¡n, secretary at the Cuban Consulate; and written account of Oleg Nechiporenko, vice consul
 Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate to request 'an in-transit visa for travel through Cuba to the Soviet Union' But he had no 'passport-style pictures of himself necessary for the visa'
 Silvia DurÃ¡n 'filled out duplicate visa application forms for him and then explained he would have to get his Soviet visa before she could issue his Cuban visa' .
 Oswald went to the Soviet Embassy and met Kostikov, then Nechiporenko, whom he told that the Embassy in Washington had turned him down for a visa . Oswald told the Soviets that the embassy in Washington, D.C., was turned down .
 According to the rules, a visa application should be handled in the U.S. but Nechiporenko said he'd make an exception . He said he would make a visa exception .
 The papers would still have to be sent to Moscow and the reply from there would have to go to Oswald's permanent U.S. address . This process would take at least 4 months .
 He claimed to DurÃ¡n that the Soviets had said there'd be no problem with a visa . He claimed that Soviets had told him they'd be able to get a visa to visit the country .
 Oswald tried to convince Yatskov to give him a visa, saying 'I am afraid... they'll kill me. I am afraid' Oswald was assassinated in the Soviet Embassy in Moscow .
 Nechiporenko, Kostikov and Yatskov managed to calm him down, but he would not take the visa application forms they offered him, as if 4 months would be too late .
 Newman's account works as long as we set aside the issue of Azcue not identifying Oswald, and DurÃ¡n saying he was short and blonde . Then he left.
 Newman's account of real events goes up to 10.30am Saturday, 28 September . Newman: "It's not just an account of events, but that's real events"
 'DurÃ¡n' put an American on the line to the Soviet Embassy at 11.51am . The CIA telephone surveillance transcript of the call has been released . The call was recorded by the Soviets in the early hours of the day .
 He speaks in bad Russian and says he had visited the Soviet Embassy, now has 'his address' from the Cuban Consulate, and agrees to come to the embassy now to 'leave' his 'address' with them .
 Newman reasons that this is a DurÃ¡n impostor and an Oswald imposter . Newman: 'Trying to keep the conversation going' by talking about addresses, but does not realize that the real Oswald was not interested in visa application forms, but immediate help from the
 The CIA sent a cable to their own Mexico City station with an accurate description of the true Oswald . Meanwhile the CIA sent the cable with a detailed description of Oswald's true whereabouts .
 While Oswald was murdered, DurÃ¡n, the other person who had impersonated him was still alive .
 The day after the JFK assassination, the CIA station in Mexico City informed the Mexican authorities that she should be arrested . As she was a Mexican citizen not a Cuban diplomat, they did just that . The CIA told her to be arrested the day after JFK assassination .
 She told her interrogators Oswald never returned to the Consulate after the 27 September . But the Warren Commission, influenced by the CIA and the Mexican government, reported that 'confidential information' told them that he did . DurÃ¡n's 23 November statement was not accurately reported
 Oswald may even have threatened to kill JFK if the 'Solo' story is to be believed . Oswald may have threatened JFK with the assassination of JFK, according to the story .
 The CIA could protect operations and sources, etc., but it led to the death of a President . That's if Oswald was the assassin .
 Oswald's trip to Mexico City 'made no sense at all,' Newman writes . 'On the surface, Oswald's visit to Mexico made no sense,' he writes .
 Oswald could have been prosecuted for going to Cuba, while the State Department in the summer of '63 had already given him permission to travel to the USSR . He could easily have done via Europe not Cuba, Newman says .
 Oswald could not get a Cuban visa without getting a Soviet visa first, so it brought him into almost inevitable contact with Kostikov . Oswald was not allowed to travel to Cuba to get a visa to get into the country .
 In the second transcript, the 1 October one, both men were specifically named . In the first transcript, both of the men are specifically named.

 Shenon: "In truth, we'll never know exactly what was in that note, and its been described in different ways" Shenon told host Bob Schieffer: "We'll never be able to find out what happened to the note"
 President Kennedy's assassination could have been prevented, perhaps easily, says Kelley . Kelley's larger conclusion was that the assassination could be prevented . Kelley: "I'm not sure what happened to President Kennedy, but I'm sure he was wrong"
 Navy pathologist James Humes threw his blood-stained notes from Kennedy's autopsy into the fire after he transcribed a fresh copy of the report . Shenon tells the story of how Humes burned the notes after transcribing them .
 The commission's investigators never even saw the photos and X-rays from the autopsy . They were in Robert Kennedy's custody at the Justice Department at the time of the shooting .
 Chief Justice "made decisions that were designed to protect the legacy,"" Shenon said . " Repeatedly in the history of the Warren Commission you see the chief justice making decisions," he said .
 The decision to block access to the autopsy photos caused ""huge turmoil"" among the commission's staff, he added .
 Shenon also points to the CIA as having taken great steps to cover up their knowledge of Oswald's visit to Mexico City before the assassination . Shenon says the CIA took great steps in order to hide their knowledge .
 The book's prologue opens with the story of diplomat Charles William Thomas, a career State Department employee . Thomas uncovered details about Oswald's time in Mexico, including his affair with a woman who was a supporter of Castro .
 The reports Thomas wrote to CIA Mexico City Station Chief Winston Scott with those details were ignored, as was the memo he sent to then-Secretary of State William P Rogers when Thomas was forced out of the State Department in 1969 .
 A section of Scott's memoirs which included details about the extent of the CIA's monitoring of Oswald in Mexico was only declassified in the 1990s .
 The agency photographed Oswald outside of the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City, and recorded his phone calls while he was in Mexico . The evidence never reached the commission, but evidence never did .
 Scott told the Warren Commission that he did not believe there was a conspiracy, Shenon says . "Apparently in his memoirs he says he exactly the opposite,"" Shenon said .

 Marina, 72, has lived with her second husband, Ken Porter, in Rockwell, Texas, since the mid-1970s . Her reversal on the question of Oswaldâs guilt came as a result of reading books and other material about the JFK assassination .
 Pacepa traced a wealth of Soviet operational patterns visible throughout the material on Oswald that had been turned up by U.S. investigators . The KGB's operational patterns were visible in the material turned up in the book .
 George DeMohrenschildt became convinced Oswald was recruited by the Soviets when he was a Marine stationed in Atsugi, Japan, outside Tokyo . Pacepa concluded DeMohrels was Oswaldâs KGB handler .
 In testimony to the Warren Commission, DeMohrenschildt was remarkably vague about how he and his wife met the Oswalds . He testified under oath that he tried hundreds of times to recall how exactly we met Oswalds, he said .
 George DeMohrenschildt had a tendency to show up just where the CIA might have needed him . His wife, Jeanne, was equally vague in her testimony to the Warren Commission .

 Milteer "emphaticallyâ denied ever making any threat against President Kennedy, a report says . He also denied knowing Oswald or Jack Ruby, Oswald’s killer . The agents never confronted him with the tape-recorded threat .
 Adams says his FBI superiors never informed him that a tape of the threat had been made, limited the scope of the questioning . Adams says that’s because he was not informed of the tape . Adams: The tape was made, and limited the questioning of him .

 Former staff member on the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the 1970s, Dan Hardway, recently had an interview with Black Ops Radio . That posting is here . Hardway was a member of the committee on the Assassinations .
 Hardway was a law student when he went to work for the House Select Committee . The committee was reinvestigating the Kennedy assassination . Hardway worked for the committee in the 1960s .
 He and another young staffer, Edwin Lopez, were assigned to delve into CIA files relating to the assassination . The CIA required them to do all their work at CIA headquarters .
 They could take notes but could not remove anything else from the building . They could not take notes or anything else else from building .
 At first the CIA was cooperative, bringing whatever records Hardway and Lopez were requesting . At some point, however, when it became clear that the two staffers knew what they were doing and where they were going, the CIA abandoned its cooperative attitude .
 CIA agent named George Joannides to serve as the CIA representative with whom the two staffers would now have to deal with . The agency brought in a CIA agent instead of a CIA representative .
 Joannides succeeded in blocking and obstructing the investigation being conducted by Hardway and Lopez . From that point on, he blocked and obstructed the investigation, Hardway says .

 In conspiracy cases, conspiracy merely describes a criminal act involving two or more individuals . In those cases, a â�€conspiracyâ�™ merely describes an alleged crime involving two people .
 Every day, establishment media reports on various criminal conspiracies, including racketeering, insider trading, political corruption, sex scandals and murder plots . The establishment media is particularly fond of murder plots, particularly when a husband or wife or crazed lover hires an assassin to knock off troublesome or inconvenient
 The details and facts of those conspiracies attract a great deal of attention from journalists and news personalities who pore over police blotters . Yet, over the last 50 years, the simple, descriptive word â has taken on a double life . The simple descriptive word

 Bob Schieffer says Kennedy was killed by a •madman.â�™ Rob Lowe compares criticism of the Warren Commission with Charlie Sheen’s belief that the moon is hollow.
 As David Talbot points out, it is exactly what the establishment media have been over the last 50 years . The establishment media has been the same thing for 50 years, he says .
 It is a failure that has metastasized over the five decades since, with those entrenched behind the walls of network news, major newspapers and sanitized pulp-history . Theyâre elusive about their bungled reporting on a sloppy criminal conspiracy of epic proportions .
 Many reporters and editors didnât ask questions when faced with rapid-fire public executions of a sitting president and his accused killer . Perhaps it is forgivable that many reporters and . editors didn”s ask questions .
 Itâs even reasonable to sympathize with Chief Justice Earl Warren, who LBJ forced him into an untenable situation . But that was then, when the Supreme Court was in charge of LBJ .

 Kennedy needed to reassure a shaken nation, support his widowed sister-in-law and her two young children in addition to his own brood of kids . He needed to maintain the cohesion and political relevance of the entire Kennedy clan while contending with his own soul-crushing sadness .
 The view has become clearer thanks to the accumulation of documents released over the last two decades . Some as recently as a few months ago, some had long been kept from public view .
 A review of documents by the Globe paints a picture of a brother responding to the assassination with equal parts crippling grief and growing suspicions . No one had done more than he to create enemies for the Kennedy administration â the right kind of enemies .

 Jimmy Hoffa was the most vocal of the detractors of the Kennedy White House . Both John and Robert Kennedy had sat on the Kefauver Committee in the late 1950s looking into organized crime in America .
 The very fact that the President was so completely defenseless naturally gave cause to cast disparaging glances at the organization whose primary duty is to protect him . The President was in a state of state when he was assassinated in 2011 .
 When we look at who might have had a hand in the planning and execution of this execution, we normally list the CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, the anti-Castro Cubans, the Joint Chiefs of Staff/Pentagon/DIA, the Texas oil fortunes of

 Herve Lamarr is a rather peculiar-looking Frenchman who called himself Herre Lamarr . Lamarr was not a writer, but a rather odd-looking Frenchman .
 It was this slightly-built editor who took the voluminous notes, reports, interview transcripts and essays that the operatives had accumulated over the past 40+ months and collated them into a somewhat readable concise report .
 Lamarr came up with the pseudonym "James Hepburn" based on his love and admiration for actress Audrey Hepburn . Lamarr was also known for his love of Hepburn and his admiration for the actress .

 Lamarr had a book with content that could change the world's view of what had happened in Dallas . Lamarr: "I'm not sure what happened to Dallas" Lamarr's book could change world view of Dallas .
 After approaching nearly every major American and British publisher and getting rejections from all of them, Lamarr decided to begin writing in Europe . Lamarr's book is published in Europe and Australia .
 Farewell America.com is published by the Washington Post, Washington Post. The Washington Post's editorial staff voted for the magazine to publish Farewell.com . The editorial staff of the Post expressed a "no" vote when asked if it should be published .
 The book was a natural product of the results of the research and that research named names and placed blames . But that was the entire tone of the book, the author says .
 I won't disclose what research found, leaving it up to you to read the book, but I will say that it cast light in directions which, at that time, had always been in shadows .
 When it was published in France under the title America Brule, it quickly shot to the top of the non-fiction bestseller charts .
 The only way to get an edition published in English was to self-publish it . Italian and German editions soon followed, each a bestseller as well .
 It was registered in Vaduz, the tiny capital city of the even tinier Duchy of Liechtenstein, nestled in the Alps .
 The books were actually printed in Belgium and shipped to Manchester, England and Montreal, Quebec . They were shipped to the UK and Canada .
 The print run has never been disclosed but the print run is believed to be in the 10,000 range . The book was released in 2010 .
 4,000 were shipped for distribution throughout the UK and the other 6,000 for distribution in North America . By having them sent out from Montreal they kept them out of the reach of the U.S. authorities .
 copies which were in England were distributed without incident to various bookstores in the British Isles . Copies which were sent to Canada came under attack quite quickly .
 After about one-third of the consignment had been shipped, a very odd thing happened . After about a third of the shipment had been sent, it was shipped out of the store .
 I have been able to place together some random facts and oddities into a fairly reliable story of what indeed happened . I'm not sure what happened .
 Through some logistical legerdemain they were able to create an excise on hardcover books which were printed in Belgium . The excise was created to allow people to buy a hardcover book from Belgium .
 This means that the books would be seized for non-payment of a duty which didn't even exist when the shipment arrived in Canada . The books were seized for not paying a duty that didn't exist at the time of the shipment .

 Scuttlebutt was that the FBI had bought up all remaining copies and had them destroyed . FBI believed to have destroyed copies of the book .
 Government relations are good for the bottom line, but very good for government relations . Not good for bottom line but for the government relations. Government relations.
 The book showed up as part of a Canadian government auction back in the spring of 1984 . But the rumors were untrue and for some reason, still unknown, it showed up .
 There were two lots of about 2,000 copies each, each of which were auctioned at auction . When I saw that there were about two lots, I decided to attend .
 With most of the auction audience after office furniture and the like, I was unopposed when bidding for the first lot of 2,000 copies of the book . The book is now being auctioned at auction in New York .
 The first lot was auctioned off in the early hours of Monday morning . The second lot was bidding for the second lot . The auction house is expected to be auctioned in the coming days .
 When I paid for the lot and got my receipt and release slip I was approached by the two men and offered twice what they had just paid for . The two men offered to pay for the second lot in cash, right there and then, if I gave them my release slip and receipt

 We are left confused and shocked by this one tragic, seemingly senseless murder . We were left confused, shocked by the murder .
 Presidential assassination became a national nightmare . Consequently, the presidential assassination became an American nightmare .

 A patsy was held up to us as the alleged assassin only to have his life taken . The patsies were held up by the police only to be held up as an alleged assassin . This is the first time we have seen a suspected assassin in the past .
 A false summary report was presented to us by the new president that did not correspond to the evidence found in the official 26 volumes of the Warren Commission testimony . The new president presented the report to the Senate on Thursday .
 As a result, our national nightmare continued to be haunted by the lack of clear answers to the assassination . "As a result of the assassination," the president's widow says .
 Over the decades a majority of Americans refused to believe that one lone gunman was the assassin . A majority of people still believe that a lone gunman is responsible for the assassination .
 Researchers discovered that witnesses were intimidated, security protocol measures were violated, state laws were broken, evidence destroyed, evidence planted and evidence planted . incompetent medical physicians were used to perform the presidential autopsy, according to the researchers .
 No motivation could be established by government authorities for the alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald . No motivation was established by authorities for Oswald, who is accused of being the assassin of the July 4, 1917 .
 "Our national spirit was weakened because those in power did not accept the American constitutional way to change power," says President Obama . "Those in power [did] not accept a constitutional way," says Obama .
 Conspiracy theories emerged because legal forensic examination of the evidence was faulty and controlled by external government authorities . Forensic examination was faulty, according to experts at the time .
 A conspiracy was created to hide the truth and to ensure a successful assassination, says CNN.com's John Sutter.com . The author of the book, "A Conspiracy to Hide the truth" was created by the president of the United States .
 Because very high-level government officials were complicit in organizing, concealing and promoting falsehoods to cover their participation in the assassination plot, the plot was uncovered .
 Without answers for the tragedy of Dallas, the pain will continue to haunt the souls of thoughtful Americans . Various government intelligence, security and military agencies went along because they were told to .
 Justice delayed is no justice at all to find those responsible and the American soul remains anguished . Justice delayed will no justice in the United States .
 None of the TV specials aired here or in the United States over the last few weeks have explored Oswald's life before Dallas in any depth . I hope the film provides a counter-argument to the mythology still swirling around Oswald in the media .
 It was heartening to see the film outscore Parkland in many reviews here yesterday . The film is heartening that it outscored Parkland .
 Please help spread the word about the film within and beyond the research community . The film is based on a novel about the life of a scientist in the field of medicine .

 She wanted to be a novelist and was well down the path, she said . She said she’s been reading some of Stephen Kingâs material on how to write, with which I am familiar .
 She said she was deeply engaged in the first book in the trilogy and told me about it, and said itâ�’d been written for adolescent girls .
 There was already some street buzz about the series, and I was intrigued as to why someone would write a book about survival and murder for an audience of 15-year-old girls .
 Not wasting her time here anymore suggested that perhaps it was to alert the audience to the New World Order. Suggested that perhaps she was alerting them to the new world Order. Not wasting time here again suggested that maybe it was .
 I hope she is right, and I hope that the 15-year-old girls and boys pay close attention and practice their archery skills . I hope it will be a great experience for the students at the school .
