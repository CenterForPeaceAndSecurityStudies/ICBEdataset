 Washington was wary of Beijing's willingness to break with the Kremlin in pursuit of its ideological objectives . However, prior to Autumn 1962 uncertainty remained in Washington .
 Officials in the Kennedy Administration believed China was the more militant of the two communist powers . China was seen to be the more dangerous to the United States in Autumn 1962 .
 U.S. policy of non-engagement with China is a result of a shift in threat perception . China's growing influence in China has led to a policy of notengagement, a former diplomat says .
 President John F Kennedy held a news conference on 20 November 1962, three weeks after Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove Soviet missile installations from Cuba, and only hours after China declared a unilateral ceasefire in their month-long border war with India .
 The president suggested it was too early to gauge the exact meaning of the growing rift in the communist camp .
 Turner was emerging as a national security concern of the first order, surpassing the Soviet Union as the most clear and present danger to U.S. interests in Asia and beyond . Turner is emerging as an emerging threat to the United States in Asia .
 Earlier studies have noted how the crises in the Caribbean and Himalayas served to underline the gravity of Sino–Soviet discord for U.S. officials .
 This analysis offers the most detailed investigation yet of the Sino–Soviet dispute . It argues that uncertainty remained prior to Autumn 1962 over Beijing’s willingness to countenance an irrevocable break with Moscow . U.S. policy-makers inched toward a proper appreciation of the
 China had attacked India in pursuit of limited objectives in a localised dispute . Neither party had proven a paragon of virtue in the dispute .
 When interpreted in reference to growing Sino–Soviet differences on foreign policy, China's offensive assumed a portent transcending the conflict’s local dimensions . The U.S. analysis suggests a troubling manifestation of a militant foreign policy line determined by national ambition and ideological zeal .
 By the beginning of 1963, U.S. officials believed Mao’s China was the more militant of the two communist powers . China posed the greater immediate danger to United States interests, the author says .
 The Sino–Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was concluded in February 1950 . The treaty was one of the more predictable corollaries of the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War .
 Moscow and Beijing were united by a pronounced anti-American and anti-U.S. sentiment . Both powers set themselves in opposition to a post-war international order dominated by the United States . Beijing and Moscow were united in their opposition to the U.S.-led world post-
 It seemed altogether logical, therefore, that the Soviet Union and the newly created People’s Republic of China should seek common cause in the struggle against US–led world imperialism . The USSR and the PPP should join forces together to oppose US imperialism in the world .
 Kremlinologists and “China-watchers” in the American foreign policy bureaucracy were alert to what in 1949 the United States ambassador to China, Leighton Stuart, called “something less than comradely trust’ in the nascent Sino–Soviet partnership . In February 1949
 Chinese Communist and Soviets were seen to be weakening in time as national priorities diverged and traditional Russo–Chinese tensions re-emerged . The ligature of strategic and ideological interest that bound the two parties together would weaken in time .
 As has been documented at length elsewhere, there was a strong—if neither universal nor uniform—awareness of this discord at all levels of the Truman Administration . The Truman Administration was aware of the discord .
 Turner was inspired by the Korean War, when Chinese ‘volunteers’ joined with the North Korean Army to fight U.S. forces and their allies to a bloody stalemate . Turner was the first Chinese "volunteer" to join with North Korea in the Korean
 The Eisenhower Administration consistently placed China on the wrong side of a Manichean contest between the Free World and a Soviet-directed International Communist movement . The U.S. public was almost visceral antipathy toward Mao’s regime in the years following the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement
 Administration acknowledged potential for and even sought to foment divisions in communist camp . Privately, however, the Administration acknowledged the potential for divisions in the communist camp.
 Administration’s ‘closed door’ policy was predicated, at least in part, on the notion that latent Sino–Soviet animosities might be fostered by forcing China to rely on the Soviet Union . The U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has
 Beijing, it was reasoned, would chafe at its junior status in the alliance . Beijing would grow to resent the failure of Moscow to provide political and economic support on a level commensurate with China’s national ambitions .
 Beijing’s excessive demands for such support, and ingratitude for the support it received, would engender comparable levels of resentment in the Kremlin . At once, Beijing's excessive demands and ingrattitude for such . support would also engender . resentment in Russia, says
 American officials in the 1950s thought a Sino–Soviet split improbable . At the same time, there was no shortage of American officials who thought a split was improbable .
 Reports of Sino– Soviet tensions began filtering through to Washington in the late 1950s . It was initially unclear if these tensions were significant enough to damage the alliance .
 President Kennedy’s presidency was a period of uncertainty as to the capacity of the communist powers to maintain a functioning—if imperfect—alliance in spite of these differences . Still, over the first eighteen months or so of Kennedy's presidency, uncertainty remained as to .
 Kennan: Beijing’s economic difficulties and Soviet frustration with the uneven returns of peaceful co-existence might compel both sides to seek temporary accommodation . Kennan was then ambassador to Yugoslavia .
 American officialdom did not speak with a single voice on the causes of the dispute . It is possible to make several broad observations about how these officials generally characterised Sino–Soviet differences . These characterisations informed American perceptions of the Chinese threat relative to the Soviet threat .
 Long-standing Sino–Russian border tensions and the troubled history of inter-party relations since the 1920s formed the principal pillars of the Sino-Soviet relationship’s historical framework . In this analysis, long-standing border tensions are considered key to the relationship .
 Beijing had apparently concluded that Moscow was thwarting its efforts to assume a more prominent international role, while sacrificing China’s national interests . More immediately, Beijing decided to stop Moscow from taking advantage of the situation .
 Beijing had decided to challenge Soviet leadership of the communist camp on ideological grounds . In doing so, it cast itself as the guardian of the Marxist-Leninist faith against the Kremlin’s revisionist apostasy .
 Much of the recently declassified analysis produced by the CIA’s Sino–Soviet Studies Group demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the importance of ideologically based differences over the “correct road” to Communism at home and abroad .
 Questions of ideology and national interest were generally seen as mutually reinforcing determinants of Sino–Soviet relations . Rather than pulling the relationship in opposite directions, the relationship was seen as a mutually reinforcing factor .
 The Chinese resented their subordinate position in the ‘partnership” with Moscow, it was reasoned . It was reasoned that they resented the failure to secure recognition for China as a great power on the world stage . China resented its subordinate position with Moscow .
 The view in Washington was that the Chinese were in an earlier, more radical, and, in a word, angrier stage of revolution than the Soviets . Added to these largely nationalistic considerations, the view was that China was in a more radical and angrier state of revolution . The
 Some analysts suggested Beijing’s hubris on this score was simply an abstract attempt to reconcile Yan’an-era Maoist theory on protracted warfare with the realities of the nuclear age .
 Beijing’s broader ambivalence—and, increasingly, opposition—toward peaceful co-existence . Such nuance, however, was lost on senior policy-makers, not entirely surprising . China's ambivalent approach to peaceful coexistence is not quite surprising .
 A successful test of even the most primitive nuclear device would place considerable pressure on governments in Asia to accommodate Beijing’s ambitions of regional hegemony . At once, a successful Chinese test of such a device would put considerable pressure .
 While Beijing's foreign policy line was more incendiary than Moscow’s in 1961 and 1962, it was the nuclear-capable and politically formidable Soviet enemy that kept U.S. policy-makers awake .
 Khrushchev’s references to peaceful coexistence aside, in a period of essentially unbroken U.S.-Soviet confrontation . The Cold War was largely focused on Berlin and Cuba .
 U.S. estimates of the Chinese threat were informed by readings of Beijing’s foreign policy objectives and willingness to pursue those objectives . Further, as might be expected, readings were also expected to be taken into account Beijing's willingness and ability to pursue objectives .
 The failure of the Great Leap Forward had seriously undermined Beijing’s capacity to project its power beyond China, says President Kennedy . Washington had a growing view in Washington that the failure of Great Leap forward seriously undermined China's ability to project power .
 The United States Consul-General in Hong Kong from November 1961, Marshall Green, had arrived in the Crown Colony . Hong Kong was Washington’s ‘keyhole’ into a country to which it lacked direct access .
 Seen from Washington, China remained a fundamentally hostile power, writes Andrew Hammond . Hammond: China remains a combination of arrant national chauvinism and ideological dogmatism . Hammond says China is acting in pursuit of objectives anathema to American interests in Asia and beyond .
 Rusk may have noted a new “degree of moderation” in Chinese diplomacy . But it is by no means clear that this moderation registered in Kennedy’s mind .
 Beijing’s “campaign of smiles” is indicative of broader uncertainty in Washington at this juncture . Beijing's willingness to temper its foreign policy radicalism to avoid a showdown with the Soviet Union and direct confrontation with the United States .
 Beijing could not make meaningful concessions to Moscow without seriously compromising basic national and ideological interests . The nature of Sino–Soviet differences was such as Sino-Russian differences . Beijing was forced to compromise with Moscow without compromising its national interests .
 Beijing’s preoccupation with stabilising the Chinese economy following the Great Leap Forward might, some argued, leave it reluctant to pursue these interests to their fullest extent, lest doing so force a break with the Soviet Union and compound China's already substantial difficulties . On the other,
 China’s victory in the month-long Sino–Indian border war began on 20 October with a Chinese assault on Indian positions at both the eastern and western ends of the disputed 2400-mile border . The victory played a key role in shaping the Administration's understanding of China�
 Beijing's decision for war was likely intended to forestall India’s ‘forward policy’ on the border . New Delhi believes a show of military assertiveness could force a weakened China into settling the border dispute on Indian terms .
 China's devastating display of military force in the war shattered New Delhi's illusions about India's strength relative to China’s . It also undercut the emerging imagery in Washington of a militarily vulnerable and potentially passive post–Great Leap China .
 At least some officials in Washington recognised that China’s claims in the border dispute were not entirely illegitimate .
 New Delhi has sometimes seemed the more intransigent party to the border dispute . New Delhi had sometimes seemed to be more intrident in the past .
 This would be in exchange for an Indian accommodation of China’s claim to the unpopulated Aksai Chin plateau in Ladakh to the west . The plateau provided the Chinese with a strategically important passage from Xinjiang to Tibet .
 Beijing’s objectives were likely limited to embarrassing the Soviets, projecting an image of strength and determination in the region; to boosting PLA morale; and to securing the Aksai Chin .
 Concerns that the Chinese might broaden the offensive and, as the U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith put it, “really come down the mountain in force,” became particularly pronounced when India’s lines of defense collapsed after a second wave of
 At a meeting between Kennedy and his national security advisors on 19 November, Rusk reported that the state of Assam, in 1962, could be in Chinese hands within the week .
 Administration's decision to extend emergency military aid to India was part of an attempt to effect a realignment of neutral India’s position in the Cold War . It should be noted that the Administration’�s decision . was . part of a . attempt—ultimately unsuccessful—
 The 19 November meeting was not so much the decision to expedite emergency military assistance to India, but rather the sense of urgency that pervaded the discussion . The urgency indicative of a genuine anxiety in Washington at this juncture over the threat an unchecked China posed to the subcontinent .
 Fears of a larger Chinese offensive eased following Beijing’s announcement of a unilateral ceasefire on 20 November . China withdrew troops behind the McMahon Line in the east and the “November 7, 1959 line of control” in the west .
 In May 1963, six months after the ceasefire took effect, the weight of his concern was apparent at a meeting of the National Security Council . The weight of the concern became apparent at the meeting in May .
 Any large Chinese Communist attack on any part of that area would require the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S. This is to be preferred over the introduction of large numbers of United States soldiers .
 Kennedy appeared willing to accept the costs broached by his advisors . While both scenarios seemed improbable, the latter particularly so so, Kennedy seemed willing to go along .
 The Chinese assault suggested a politically astute adversary with an impressive capacity to project its military power in a highly calculated fashion . In part, this was a result of the efficacy of the Chinese assault .
 China’s attack was interpreted in reference to the increasingly divergent foreign policy lines of Moscow and Beijing . The attack assumed a portent it would not otherwise have possessed. More than anything else, however, because of the attack, it assumed that .
 The Bureau argued that “Peiping is now testing its strategy of risk-taking against that of Moscow’s Moscow.”
 The U.S. consulate in Hong Kong reported that Beijing had “actively intervened to obstruct critical Soviet– United States negotiations” on the removal of the missiles . Beijing circulated counter-proposals within the communist camp designed to circumscribe Khrushchev’s freedom of
 The Soviet decision to install missile facilities in Cuba had taken the world to the nuclear brink . The Sino–Indian conflict was understood by American analysts as a localised conflict with little threat of escalation . The concurrent crises in the Himalayas and the Caribbean, interpreted in reference to pre
 The Chinese threat rose relative to the Soviet one, policy-makers say . As a result, to the minds of these policy makers, the Chinese threat rises relative to Soviet one . The situation in China has been likened to the Cold War .
 The “two curves crossed,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense William Bundy recalled . The threat of Chinese expansion into peripheral areas now loomed as more immediate than that posed by Soviet power .
 Three broad observations can be made about how American readings of the international environment following events in Autumn 1962 informed Washington’s China policy calculus in the Kennedy years .
 Washington took several tentative steps toward effecting an alignment with Moscow aimed—quite narrowly—at checking Chinese militancy . First, starting in early 1963, Washington took a tentative step toward a closer relationship with Moscow .
 China’s foreign policy line was dangerous and counter-productive, writes Andrew Hammond . Russia's pursuit of peaceful coexistence could prove mutually beneficial, he says . Hammond says .
 Kennedy Administration had refrained from articulating a clear policy on Sino–Soviet differences . Concerned that any explicit ‘intervention’ in the dispute might inadvertently push Moscow and Beijing to seek a new modus vivendi .
 Khrushchev's policy of peaceful co-existence promised better returns than Mao’s alternative of aggression and subversion . More importantly, events in Autumn 1962 served to highlight the apparent need to demonstrate Khrushchev's policy was peaceful, not subverted .
 Rusk argued in 1963, both publicly and privately, that engagement with the Soviets on the basis of peaceful co-existence would help underline the false logic of Mao’s eponymous dogma .
 Questions pertaining to China’s military capabilities were now afforded a higher priority by senior policymakers . The crises of 1962 and 1962 served to underline the Chinese threat, with China's military capabilities now a priority .
 Kennedy had always been troubled by the prospect of a nuclear-capable China . Over the first two years of his presidency he displayed little sense of urgency on the matter .
 The president would occasionally turn to the question of China’s nuclear programme . It was only in early 1963, after developments in Autumn 1962 seemed to underline the dimensions and immediacy of the Chinese challenge, that Kennedy moved the foreign policy bureaucracy into gear in a search for means to
 The document offers no hint as to what “action” Kennedy might have had in mind .
 Historians have argued that Kennedy and his senior advisers seriously contemplated undertaking preventive military strikes against China’s nuclear programme . However, several historians argue that Kennedy seriously contemplated a preventive military strike .
 Washington's pursuit of a test ban treaty in 1963 intersected in Washington’s pursuit of the treaty . The two increasingly pronounced themes in the U.S. national security discourse were discussed in 1963 .
 Kennedy had multiple reasons for securing the treaty in 1963, including reversing the momentum of the nuclear arms race . Kennedy also wanted to make progress toward détente with Moscow . Kennedy had many reasons for wanting to securing this treaty, not least his interest in reversing momentum .
 The anti-proliferation connection, particularly as it related to China, assumed a new measure of importance in Kennedy’s interest in a test ban . However, in 1963 the anti-terror connection, especially as it . related to . China, was a key ally in the
 The shared antipathy toward Maoist militancy proved insufficient basis for Soviet–American co-operation . Détente in the 1960s was a failure in the wake of the Maoist movement .
 The U.S. never did undertake preventive action against Chinese nuclear facilities . And, of course, the United States never did .
 China’s emergence as the more dangerous of the two communist powers reinforced the logic of the U.S. policy of non-engagement with a recalcitrant, as yet ‘untamed” Beijing .
 Soviet and American leaders shifted course and “slowly accustomed themselves” to the existing international system, writes Julian Zelizer . Zelizer: Soviet and U.S. leaders were alert to the profound danger inherent in direct challenges to other side’s sphere of influence .
 The events in Autumn 1962 had a significant impact on the direction of U.S. policy toward China in the decade prior to the Sino–American rapprochement . The Cold War concerns and priorities of American policymakers in the 1960s .
