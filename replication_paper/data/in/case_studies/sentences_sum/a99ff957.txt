 In the four titles under review here, underutilized sources of information and new interpretive emphases make additional excursions over those familiar historical trails worth the time .
 John Kennedy reportedly asked the National Security Council in late 1962 . JFK reportedly asked for the help of the White House in 1962 . Kennedy reportedly told the council about the threat .
 By the time JFK won the Democratic nomination in July of that year, the Intelligence Community was moderating its ominous predictions of the immediate Soviet nuclear threat . Some senior Eisenhower administration ofﬁcials had even concluded that there was no gap .
 Kennedy continued touting the unnerving forecasts of panicky pundits and worst-case war predictions . Kennedy received classiﬁed brie ﬁngs on those reports .
 Eisenhower’s recent experience with the ‘bomber gap’ controversy steeled him to rely on his best judgment about what the Soviets would do to develop .
 Kennedy and others accused Eisenhower administration of politicizing intelligence for economic reasons . In contrast, Kennedy stressed what they could do, and he and others said they could .
 Increased defense spending would energize the sputtering economy, provide the means to pay for domestic programs, and raise America’s stature in the post-Russia world .
 Preble presents Kennedy’s case as an amalgam of complaints that Democrats, intellectuals, economists, and dissonant military ofﬁcers had been making for several years, but which had had little impact .
 Preble sees a direct link between Kennedy’s missile gap alarmism and his application of counterinsurgency doctrine in the Third World . Preble approves of Eisenhower's suspicion of what he called the ‘military-industrial complex’
 Ike's foreign policy was hardly less adventurous than JFK's . The 1950s were a very busy time for the CIA’s covert action ofﬁces .
 Kennedy and the Missile Gap is a worthy addition to the ‘Kennedy as Cold Warrior’ literature . The book is published by John Sutter, a friend of Kennedy, and the author .
 "A published dissertation, it is well organized, clearly written, and solidly researched," says author .
 Preble shows better than previous authors how much political mileage Kennedy got out of the missile gap . Kennedy used the alleged one to get into the White House and the real one to resolve the Cuban missile crisis . Preble: Kennedy got political mileage from the crisis .
 The same can be said about historians and the United States’ victory-of-sorts over the Soviet Union in October 1962 . The U.S. won the election in 1962 .
 Cohen’s iconoclasm obviously is not widely shared, as the missile crisis remains a staple of publishers’ lists and academic journals . Cohen: "The missile crisis is a staple" of publishers' lists and journals .
 The tapes of meetings of the NSC Executive Committee during the missile crisis have become indispensable material for scholars and a matter of disputation among them .
 They argue over the signiﬁcance of omissions and inaccuracies in the published versions, as well as about the overall utility of tapes vis-á-vis other primary sources . They argue that tapes are more reliable than other sources .
 Averting the ‘Final Failure’ by Sheldon Stern, historian at the John F Kennedy Library until 1999 . Sheldon Stern was historian at JFK Library at the time until 1999.
 Stern and Stern have engaged in a running disagreement about errors in their respective renderings and interpretations of the tapes . Stern: The tapes were recorded in the 1970s and '80s . Stern says the tapes were "a masterpiece of American history"
 Their exchanges at times have taken on a snippy tone that suggests they have ‘issues’ beyond documentary accuracy .
 He came up with the idea for his own book nearly a quarter of a century ago when he listened to the then-classiﬁed ExComm tapes . He took early retirement as soon as he could to work on his book .
 Stern has produced an accessible, readable story that breaks no new interpretive ground but is the best single volume on the ‘Thirteen Days’ episode . Stern's story is an accessible and accessible story .
 The book’s introduction is an excellent overview of the historical setting in which the crisis played out . The book is worthy of stand-alone use in the classroom .
 Stern’s version makes clear that the Kennedy brothers’ ‘preoccupation, if not an obsession’ with getting rid of Castro helped bring on the crisis, but that JFK was cagily realistic in his conundrum . Stern: JFK was realistic in cag
 The ExComm was important both for its positive and negative contributions to the outcome of the crisis . It was important for both the ExComm and for the future of the world's most important institutions .
 JFK embraced military brass’s scare-mongering about nonexistent Soviet missiles during the Cuban crisis . JFK spurned their belligerent counsel on what to do about an actual strategic threat . In contrast to the missile gap, JFK embraced the military brass's scaremongering .
 Stern presents his book as a corrective to ﬂaws in the published transcripts in his book . Stern: The book is intended to be corrective to the errors in published transcripts . Stern's book is available in the U.S.
 He adds his own slant to the ExComm proceedings when he summarizes what he regards as non-germane material . He strings together excerpts from long quotes with his own interpolations, descriptors, and segues .
 Stern rightly observes that there is no substitute for listening to the tapes . Stern enlivens the often-tedious transcripts by describing the atmospherics of meetings and the mood of ExComm members . Stern also describes the atmosphere and mood of meetings .
 Characterizing someone’s tone or attitude is a subjective exercise – other listeners may hear the ‘verbal body language’ differently . But given that Stern probably has listened to the tapes more than anyone else, readers can defer to his judgment until they put on the headphones .
 Stern identifies the participant who most vehemently disagreed as John McCloy . McCloy disagreed with Adlai Stevenson’s proposal to trade away the Jupiter missiles in Turkey .
 Undersecretary of State George Ball, who was present, said in his memoir that the speaker was McCone . However, Under Secretary of State Bill Clinton said in memoir that McCone spoke .
 JFK assassination has received so little scholarly attention that it has received little academic attention . It is a historical oddity that such an event of such Zeitgeist-altering proportions has received less scholarly attention . The JFK assassination was a major event of the 1960s and '60s .
 In an intellectual corollary to Gresham’s Law, bad historical writing has driven out the good, and even the mediocre . Instead, it's been driven out of good historical writing, and out of the good .
 The conspiracist literature is voluminous, numbering thousands of books, articles and tracts that posit almost every theory imaginable, crop up on publishers’ new titles lists with amazing frequency .
 Max Holland has been one of the few dependable JFK assassination scholars . Holland: JFK assassination was JFK's assassination . Holland has written numerous books on the JFK assassination .
 The Kennedy Assassination Tapes will be previewed in The Kennedy assassination Tapes . The Warren Commission is the subject of a new book on the assassination of JFK .
 Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone, deranged gunman who killed JFK for his own reasons . The Warren Commission did a creditable, though slipshod, job in concluding that Oswald did it by himself .
 Tapes is a collection of annotated transcripts of assassination-related telephone conversations between Lyndon Johnson and the dead president’s family and entourage . Tapes are a collection . of transcripts of conversations between Johnson and his own advisers, the directors of the FBI and CIA, journalists,
 The tapes have been available in raw and published form for some time, but there is value in having transcripts on this unique subject collected in one place .
 Holland’s background sections and annotations are clear and helpful, and his use of the present tense imparts a ‘you-are-there’ quality that adds to the voyeuristic aspect of ‘listening in’
 Tapes shows what a remarkable amount of time and worry American leaders spent on minutiae like the ‘missing Bible’ used at LBJ’s swearing-in (it actually was a Catholic missal and never was lost) and the Kennedys’ insistence
 Tapes affords many insights into LBJ’s personality and preoccupations that go beyond the ambit of this journal, but several will interest its readers . Tapes will be available in the U.S. Library of America .
 Johnson overcame his initial reluctance to form a blue-ribbon panel out of fear that free-wheeling congressional and state inquiries would point accusingly at the Soviet Union and Cuba and force him to respond in ways that risked superpower con﬉ict .
 LBJ asked Robert Kennedy to recommend someone to serve on the Warren Commission . LBJ naturally asked Kennedy to suggest someone to be on the commission .
 RFK chose former DCI Allen Dulles, most likely counting on him to steer the investigation away from the CIA's ‘regime change’ operations in Cuba .
 Johnson uncritically accepted what he heard about the assassination from FBI director J Edgar Hoover . Hoover is a fount of misinformation, including that the CIA had photographed Oswald at the Soviet embassy in Mexico City just before he went to Dallas .
 Holland calls Hoover’s ‘false omniscience’, and shown to be wrong by Agency documents declassiﬁed under the JFK assassination records act . That claim would become ammunition for a battalion of conspiracists .
 One of the drawbacks of a book like Tapes is its deliberately narrow optic . Tapes will be released in September 2015 .
 Reading it is like peering through a keyhole of one door in a large house, it's not clear what's going on inside . Reading the book is like looking at one door, but not many conclusions about what's happening inside .
 Michael Beschloss’s eclectic collections (Taking Charge and Reaching for Glory) give a better, broader view of LBJ's leadership and psychology . Holland rectiﬁes some important transcription errors and misinterpretations in them .
 JFK assassination presented Johnson with a slew of difﬁcult personal and political problems . Vietnam war in Vietnam imparted the most striking ironies to his relationship with the Kennedys .
 JFK bequeathed to him a substantial and growing troop build-up that was making a satisfactory U.S. exit strategy hard to devise . Despite Kennedy's insistence two and a half months before he died that the war was South Vietnam’s to win or lose .
 He tacitly assented to plots to oust President Ngo Dinh Diem; after that occurred just three weeks before his own death, South Vietnam fell into a spiral of instability . After that, it seemed, the instability could only be forestalled by more U.S. troops
 Kennedy’s death, when viewed in the context of later events in Vietnam, raised the possibility that had he lived, the U.S. might have avoided the quagmire altogether .
 Howard Jones’s Death of a Generation: How the Assassination of Diem and JFK Prolonged the Vietnam War . That is the thesis of Howard Jones's Death of A Generation, as declared in its subtitle, how the assassination of JFK and JFK .
 Jones’s is the latest of several hefty, deeply researched narratives on early U.S. involvement in Vietnam that includes David Kaiser and Robert Mann .
 Death addresses the unintended consequences of a Kennedy administration foreign policy . Stern’s book, Death, is published by the same publisher as Death .
 JFK was not around to deal with the problems his course reversal contributed to . Unlike in Cuba, however, he was not able to solve the problems he caused .
 For years, his defenders and detractors have debated what he would have done about Vietnam had he lived . His critics say he should have been able to do more about Vietnam .
 The most persuasive argument that he would not have withdrawn US troops is Noam Chomsky’s Rethinking Camelot . Chomsky's book Rethinks Camelot is published by Chomsky in response to the withdrawal .
 Jones does not prove his case despite imposing documentation (the notes and bibliography comprise one-sixth of the book) that leads him to say both too much and too little . Besides begging the question that JFK would have won the election – as of late 1963 – by no means certain
 Death covers much the same historical ground as Kaiser and Mann did, and its counterfactual has been examined several times elsewhere .
 JFK noted that ‘he more difﬁcult question is what means are we going to use to bring pressure to change the political atmosphere’ in the United States – a clear acknowledgement that he might not be able to get away with his decision . At that same meeting
 The other condition, apparently unrecognized by Kennedy and the NSC, was some measure of stability in South Vietnam . The administration was undermining by its simultaneous endorsement of coup plotting, he says .
 JFK's plan of extrication became moot after Diem’s death at the hands of US-inspired conspirators . However, or if ever, JFK’�s plan was put into practice, it became moot .
 As of late 1963, Kennedy and his best and brightest remained as muddled about what to do in Vietnam as the unclear intelligence picture they were receiving . What seems more arguable from the mass of evidence that Jones and his fellow tome writers have gathered is that as of late .
 That he and some of his advisers suborned the coup that killed Diem shows how badly they misread the ‘ground truth’ in South Vietnam . The coup was the result of a coup that led to Diem's assassination .
 Operation Plan 34A offers a tempting low-proﬁle way to try to stabilize the South in the months before the presidential election . Operation 34A would be expanded joint covert offensive by CIA and military .
 The political exigencies that compelled LBJ to expand the war would also have affected JFK in his second term . LBJ expanded the war in the second term of his presidency . JFK's second term would have been his second .
 Robert Kennedy knew his brother's thinking better than anyone, said they would have faced that when they came to it . Asked a few years later if the United States would have sent in more troops to prevent South Vietnam’s defeat, Robert Kennedy said he would have .
 What emerges from Jones’s exhaustive narrative is the story of a war founded on a mishmash of ideology, social science, murky intelligence, and shortterm political calculation, he says .
 LBJ's abiding bitterness over Diem’s ouster was evident more than two years later in taped Oval Ofﬁce conversations that Holland mentions . LBJ was bitter about Diem's ouster .
 Johnson asserts that ‘We all got together and got a goddamn bunch of thugs and assassinated him.’ In one of his books, he says that 'We got together to get together and get the thugs to kill him'
 If Johnson thought that the CIA had been the Kennedy administration’s ‘agent’ in eliminating Diem and thus – albeit unintentionally – had contributed to the chaos that followed, there is little wonder that he ignored the Agency’�s analyses that indicated his Vietnam policy was
 Speaking truth to power can be hazardous when the powers that be do not like what they hear . It is not always easy to tell the truth to the powers of power .
 It was a lesson that subsequent DCIs painfully had to relearn – in some cases, too well . It was the lesson they had to learn .
