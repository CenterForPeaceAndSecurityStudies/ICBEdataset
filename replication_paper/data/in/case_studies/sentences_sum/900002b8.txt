 African Americans See the Plains as the ""Promised Land"" The women and men who settled the West represented a broad range of Americans . African Americans see the Plains in the American imagination .
 Often they were lured by the claims of railroad agents skilled at stretching the truth . Sometimes the claims were made by railmen skilled at covering up .
 Others were former slaves searching for the opportunity to own their own land . Still others were former slave owners looking for the chance to own a land .
 After the Civil War, many African Americans fled the South in search of better lives elsewhere . After the war, African Americans were able to find better lives in the South again .
 Former slaves such as Henry Adams and Benjamin "Pap" Singleton encouraged African Americans to build farm communities on the Great Plains .
 These leaders helped organize a postwar migration to Kansas and beyond . They helped organize the migration to the U.S.
 Thousands of African Americans made the trek to Kansas . Offered the opportunity to succeed or fail on their own terms, as independent farmers .
 Others found work in towns and on farms in Texas, Oklahoma, Texas, and other plains states .
 African Americans in the West faced racism in the early 1900s . Despite their growing numbers, African Americans still faced racism . African Americans owned land in West still faced discrimination .
 A group of black migrants from Mississippi tried to settle in Lincoln, Nebraska, when they arrived . White townspeople drove them away from Lincoln .
 Lincoln eventually accepted black residents into the community . The migrants persisted, however, and Lincoln accepted them . Lincoln eventually became a city of Lincoln .
 On April 22, 1889, about 50,000 people lined up on the Oklahoma border . The Oklahoma-Oklahoma border was declared a state of peace .

 To buy costly new machinery, many had taken out bank loans, often with high interest rates . Many had to take out high-interest rates to buy new machinery .
 They also owed money to merchants for the seeds they bought on credit every year, and to railroads, which kept raising shipping rates .
 Crop prices, however, dropped as supply outstripped demand at home and in the world market . The price drop is due to a drop in demand and demand in the global market .
 With incomes reduced, farmers found it difficult to pay their debts . Farmers found it hard to pay debts after incomes were reduced .
 In 1867, Oliver Hudson Kelley started an educational and social organization to help farmers in Minnesota . The organization was founded by 1867 .

 The amount of money flowing through the U.S. economy was controlled by a monetary policy known as the gold standard . At that time, the money flowed through the United States economy . The gold standard was used to control the flow of money into the country's economy .
 Every paper dollar in circulation had to be backed by a dollar’s worth of gold in the U.S. Treasury . According to this policy, all paper dollars in circulation must be backed with a dollar of gold .
 Gold standard ensured the value of U.S. currency but limited the amount of money the government could print . The gold standard was established in the United States in 1903 .
 Greenbackers wanted the government to increase the money supply by issuing greenbacks backed by both gold and silver . The Greenbacks were backed by the government . The government issued greenbacks in the 1970s and '80s .
 By increasing the money supply, Greenbackers hoped to fuel inflation, or a general rise in prices, including crop prices . The money supply is expected to increase in the coming months .
 Higher crop prices would give farmers more income with which to pay off their debts . Farmers need to raise crop prices with which they can pay off debts .
 Farmers in the South and Midwest formed local organizations called Farmers’ Alliances . Farmers' Alliances were formed in the 1880s, when farmers in the Southerners and Midwest joined forces .
 These groups led protests against railroads, banks, and other powerful interests centered in the East . These groups later led protests .
 Farmers' Alliances won elections at the state level and seats in Congress in 1890 . Farmers’ Alliances helped Democrats and Republicans win state and congressional seats . Farmers' Alliance candidates claimed to support Farmer's Alliances policies .
 disappointed Alliance members vowed to create their own national political party . In response to their disappointment, disappointed members of the Alliance formed a new party .
 Populist candidate James B Weaver ran for president that year on a platform that called for government ownership of railroads, the coinage of silver to increase the money supply, and other reforms to help working people .
 More than a million Americans voted for Weaver, about 8.5 percent of the total vote . More than one million Americans vote for Weaver . Weaver was elected to lead the Republican Party .
 The Democrats were deeply divided, but the silverites prevailed as the election of 1896 approached . The silverites won the election in 1896 .
 William Jennings Bryan won the Democratic presidential nomination with a moving speech that condemned the gold standard . Bryan's speech condemned the standard of gold . Bryan was the Democratic candidate for the first time in 1896 .
 The anger and idealism that had given rise to populism did not fade with it . But the anger that gave rise to the rise to populistism did not die with it. But it is still a powerful force in American politics .
 During the party’s short life, many Americans had begun to rethink what government could and should do to promote opportunity for all . The party's short life was short .

 Germany was free to throw all its troops into the war on the western front . Germany was able to throw its troops at all costs .
 To counter the increase in German troops on the western front, the Allies asked General Pershing to assign American soldiers to Allied units to replace men killed or wounded in action .
 He did not think the Allies could end the stalemate by fighting a defensive war from the trenches . He said he did not believe the Allies were able to end a stalemate with a defensive fight .
 Wilson and Pershing felt that if the AEF did well as a separate army, the U.S. could demand a greater role in the peacemaking process after the war . Second, they felt that the A.E. could play a greater part in the peace process after
 During the course of the war, nearly 400,000 African Americans joined the armed forces . Russia's withdrawal from the war in early 1918 closed down the eastern front of the eastern line .
 The military strictly segregated black and white troops in training camps and overseas . The military was segregated during the segregation .
 People across the country held mass meetings to push for officer training for African Americans . However, people across the U.S. are pushing for training for black officers .

 World War I proved to be unlike previous wars in many ways . New technologies change the way war is fought in the modern era .
 For centuries, opposing forces had conducted combat face-to-face and hand-tohand . For example, for centuries, the war was fought in hand-and-hand .
 During the American Civil War, combatants faced off against their enemies with handguns or rifles, supported by cannons . During the war, those physically fighting the war fought with handguns, rifles and cannons .
 New technology made World War I a more impersonal war, as well as a far deadlier one . New technology enabled the war to be a far less impersonal one, and a far more deadly one .
 Weapons such as the machine gun, the flamethrower, and large cannons known as howitzers changed how and where war was fought .
 Unlike rifles and pistols, the machine gun was a rapid-firing weapon . It was the first machine gun to be made into an automatic weapon .
 Machine guns could make a greater effect when grouped together, military commanders say . Machine guns were used in the early days of World War II .
 In fact, the Germans created separate machine gun companies to support the infantry . The German machine gun company was created to support their troops .
 The invention of the machine gun had a major impact on military strategy . The machine gun was the first machine gun to be developed in the US .
 Armies accustomed to taking the offensive and attacking head-on were now at a disadvantage . Armies used to taking on the offensive were now facing a disadvantage. Armies now accustomed to attacking head on were at an advantage .
 A group of well-placed machine gunners could stop the advance of a much larger force . A well placed machine gunner could stop a larger force of a large force .

 Allied armies charged across open fields toward enemy lines, only to be mowed down by machine gun fire, leading to thousands of casualties . Machine gun fire killed thousands of Allied troops in the Battle of the Somalian War .
 In September 1915, British infantry units, each comprising about 10,000 men, charged a well-protected German position . The incident took place in September 1915 in a German-occupied area .
 In four hours, more than 8,000 men were killed, almost all by machine gun fire . Almost all of the deaths were caused by machine guns in the four hours .

 A new type of loading, firing, and recoil mechanism made these guns very useful . The guns were developed in the 1930s .
 Gunners used them to blast through barbed wire, knock out enemy machine gun nests, and lob poison gas shells at enemy trenches . Gunners also used them in the Battle of the Somalian War .
 Each shell could fire a 2,100-pound shell a distance of more than 9 miles . Each weighed about 75 tons and could fire more than 75 tons of ammunition .
 Big Berthas helped Germany sweep through Belgium on its drive west toward France . Big Berths were used in the opening stages of Germany's drive to France .

 "One got used to many things, but 1 never overcame my horror of the rats," she says . "I never overcame the horror of rats. One got . used to . many things ... but 1 got used . to many . things, she said .
 About the same time every night every night the dug-out was invaded by swarms of rats . The dug-outs were invaded by rats at the time of each night .
 One of the most terrifying threats soldiers faced was the use of chemical weapons . Chemical weapons utilize toxic agents such as poison gas to kill or harm many people . They gnawed holes in our haversacks and devoured our rations .
 Germany was the first to use poison gas in World War I . In time, the British and French also did as well .
 This caused huge, painful blisters, blindness, and lethal damage to the lungs . This caused severe blisters and blindness, causing severe damage to lungs .
 Early on, soldiers simply released mustard gas from cylinders from cylinders and relied on the wind to carry it across no-man’s land to the enemy .
 Shifting winds often blew the gas back on the sender’s trenches . However, shifting winds often blow back the gas .

 The Germans also created high-flying, gas-filled airships called zeppelins .
 Cigar-shaped aircraft were first used for scouting enemy positions . They were used to scout enemy positions during World War II . The cigar-shaped planes were used for reconnaissance missions .
 German airships terrified British civilians and alarmed the Allies . But they often missed their targets, often missing their targets .
 They built fighter planes that could fly as high as a zeppelin and developed bullets sharp enough to pierce the airship’s outer skin, causing it to explode . They also developed bullets that could pierce airship's outer skin .
 The various roles of the airplane in World War I showed its usefulness and versatility . The airplane was used in many of the war's most important battles .
 Most naval experts had already predicted that the greatest sea battles would take place between heavily armed and armored battleships . World War I was one of the most important battleships in the world .

 U-boats went undetected until it was too late to stop their torpedoes from reaching their targets . Moving silently under the sea, U.S. U.B. boats went unnoticed until they were hit by torpedoes .
 In the first four months of 1917, German U-boats sank more than 1,000 ships carrying supplies and weapons to Allied ports . In the same period, U.S. ships carrying weapons and supplies were sunk .
 The effectiveness of U-boat attacks was greatly reduced by the development of the convoy system . The convoy system was developed in order to reduce U-boats' effectiveness .
