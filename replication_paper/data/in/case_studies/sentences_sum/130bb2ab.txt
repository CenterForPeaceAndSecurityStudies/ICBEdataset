 Small increases and decreases in permitted public water-supply withdrawals can be attributed to population changes . Small increases or decreases in public water use can also be attributed .
 Large increases and decreases can be attributed to merging of supply systems, change in source, or purchases from other counties . Large increases can be seen in supply systems .
 Most introduced species are restricted to the urban and suburban areas along the coasts . Some species, like the Cuban Treefrog, are locally abundant in natural protected areas .
 Cuban Treefrogs are known predators of native treefrog species as both adults and larvae . No study has demonstrated a negative effect of Cuban Tree Frogs on native tree frog survival, abundance or occupancy rate .
 Cuban Treefrogs and two native species were monitored at four sites in Everglades National Park in southern Florida with the use of capture–mark–recapture techniques .
 After at least 5 mo of monitoring all species at each site each site we began removing every Cuban Treefrog captured . We began removing all Cuban Tree Frogs captured .
 We continued to estimate survival, abundance, and occupancy rates of native treefrogs for 1 yr after the commencement of Cuban Treefrog removal . The removal of the Cuban Tree Frogs is estimated to have reduced the number of treefrog populations .
 Mark–recapture models that included the effect of Cuban Tree Frog removal on native treefrog survival did not have considerable Akaike's Information Criterion weight . Capture rates of native species were generally very low prior to Cuban Treefrog removal .
 Estimated abundance of native treefrogs did increase after commencement of Cuban Treefrog removal, but also varied with the season of the year . Estimated abundance increased after Cuban Tree Frog removal .
 The best models of native treefrog occupancy included a Cuban Treefrog removal effect at sites with high initial densities of Cuban Tree Frogs .
 This study demonstrates that an introduced predator can have population-level effects on similar native species . The study was published in the journal Nature Conservation International .

 Artificial metalloproteins containing Co 4O 4 cubane active sites were constructed via biotin-streptavidin technology . The technology was developed by the University of California in California .
 Terminal and cofacial Co III-OH 2 moieties are observed crystallographically in a series of immobilized cubane sites . Stabilized by hydrogen bonds, terminal and co-facilitated moieties .
 For variants containing Ser and Phe adjacent to the metallocofactor, 1e -/1H + chemistry predominates until pH 8 . The oxidation becomes pH-independent above that pH 8, above which the oxidation is pH independent .
 Installation of Tyr proximal to the Co 4O 4 active site provided a single H-bond to one of a set of cofacial Co III-OH 2 groups . The H-Bond was provided by Tyr for a single point of contact with one of the Co III
 With this variant, multi-emore » /multi-H + chemistry is observed, along with a change in mechanism at pH 9. that is consistent with Tyr deprotonation .
 Adult was found ca. m high on a branch at the edge of a wooded area behind a house . This adult was found by the owner of a house in the area .
 It was photographed and released, as the species identity and significance of the animal was unknown . The species was released as it is unknown .
 The homeowner stated that he bought nursery plants often, but checked them thoroughly as he put them indoors . The homeowner said he checked the plants thoroughly before putting them outdoors .
 Since this initial finding, the homeowner learned more about Cuban Treefrogs and searched for them on many occasions at this location for two years, but detected no additional Cuban Tree Frogs . The homeowner says he has searched for more than two years for the frog .
 Since this introduction, Cuban Treefrogs have spread to Miami and now established throughout most of peninsular Florida .
 A generalist diet, high fecundity and the ability to reproduce year-round, are key to success . Use of disturbed or human-modified habitats is also a factor in success .
 Cuban Treefrogs may contribute to the decline of native treefrogs, scientists say . Scientists and managers are concerned that Cuban Tree Frogs contribute to native tree frogs' decline .
 Cuban Treefrogs may exclude native treefrogs through competition and predation . Cuban Tree Frogs exclude native species through competition or predation.
 There is cause for concern that sampling with PVC pipes may increase the vulnerability of the native species to predation . The evidence from our study suggests that Green and Squirrel Treefrogs do not alter their behavior to avoid Cuban treefrogs .
 This possibility needs further research, including whether other species of native treefrogs sympatric to where Cuban Treefrogs have invaded are naïve to the threat posed by these frogs .
 The net value of health care for patients with type 2 diabetes, 1997 to 2005, according to a study . The study looked at the net value per person's health care in the United States .

 Net value is estimated as the present discounted monetary value of improved survival and avoided treatment spending for coronary heart disease minus the increase in annual spending per patient . Net value was estimated from the present discount monetary value .
 The net value of changes in health care for patients with type 2 diabetes was $10,911 per patient between 1997 and 2005 . The positive dollar value suggests the value of health care has improved despite increased spending .
 The patient population was homogeneous and small, and the wide CIs of the estimates are compatible with a decrease as well as an increase in value . The patient populations were homogeneous, small and small .
 The economic value of improvements in health status for patients with type 2 diabetes seems to exceed or equal increases in health care spending . Those increases were worth the extra cost .
 The possibility that society is getting less value for its money could not be statistically excluded . However, there is opportunity to improve the value of diabetes-related health care, authors say .

 Sedimentation in Lago Dos Bocas reservoir has reduced the storage capacity from 37.50 million cubic meters in 1942 to 17.26 million cubic metres in 2005 . The storage loss represents a storage loss of about 54 percent, officials say .
 The long-term annual annual water-storage capacity loss rate remained nearly constant at about 320,000 cubic meters per year to about 1997 . Water storage capacity loss rates remained constant at the time .
 The inter-survey sedimentation rate between 1997 and 1999 is higher than the long-term rate at about 1.09 million cubic meters per year . The sedimentation rates are higher than that of 1997 and 1998 .
 Between 1999 and 2005 the rate is lower than the long-term rate at about 0.13 million cubic meters per year . The rate is between 1999-2005 the rate was lower .
 The Lago Dos Bocas effective sediment-contributributing drainage area had an average sediment yield of about 1,400 cubic meters per square kilometer per year between 1942 and 1997 . The area is estimated to be the largest in Brazil .
 This rate increased substantially by 1999 to about 4,600 cubic meters per square kilometer per year . It was probably due to the historical magnitude floods caused by Hurricane Georges in 1998 .
 Impact of Hurricane Georges on basin sediment yield could have been the cause of this change . The magnitude of the floods could have nearly depleted the Lago Dos Bocas drainage area of easily erodible sediment .

 Discussion of the Cuban library system includes comments from interviews with leading librarians in that country . Discussion of Cuban library systems includes comments .
 Effects of the Castro regime and the U.S. embargo on Cuba and its libraries are considered . The study will look at the libraries in Cuba .
 This paper discusses the economic reforms initiated by Cuban President Raúl Castro in 2008 and its effect on the country's fast-growing, vulnerable population of older persons 60+ years of age .
 These two factors combined have reduced the proportion of the population in the work force . It has also reduced the number of people in the workforce .
 Population aging is a major reason why the government has introduced structural reforms and reduced social spending . Social spending has weakened the welfare state on which older persons depend, government says .
 Policy makers need to address the impact the reforms are having on older Cubans . Older Cubans should be considered as active participants in economic reform, experts say .
 Data for this paper come from qualitative, case study research carried out in Havana between 2008-15 and from a review of the literature on aging and economic reforms in Cuba .
 Two case studies illustrate the impact of the economic reforms on older persons . Case studies show the effect of the reforms on the lives of older people .
 Cuban Epidemic Optic Neuropathy caused visual loss, peripheral neuralgias, and other neurological symptoms in over 50,000 persons, an incidence of almost 0.5% of the entire population .
 We then relate the Cuban epidemic to the fictional epidemic of contagious blindness depicted by Nobel Laureate José Saramago in his 1995 novel Blindness . The Cuban epidemic is similar to that of fictional blindness .
 This novel describes an unnamed modern city in which all inhabitants, except the ophthalmologist's wife, are affected with white, not black, blindness . All inhabitants of the unnamed city are affected by white blindness .
 The sources for the Cuban epidemic were an extensive review of the published literature and personal communications with physicians who treated these patients .
 Both authors have analyzed the novel and the critical literature about Saramago's writings . Both authors analyze the novel, critical literature .
 Saramago uses the epidemic of blindness as an allegory to comment on human weakness and immorality . He may also have known of the actual Cuban epidemic .
 Saramago was a lifelong member of the Communist party . He was a friend of Fidel Castro and an admirer of the Cuban government . He died in Havana .
 We have no proof that Blindness was influenced by the Cuban epidemic, but we find it plausible . Blindness may have been affected by the epidemic in Cuba .
 Saramago's novel depicts the actions of an ophthalmologist during an epidemic of blindness . It is valuable to examine the real and fictional epidemics side by side, not least .
 Ophthalmologists may be interested in a novel that uses the language of eyes, vision, sight, sight and blindness extensively .

 The North Cascade Range in the vicinity of South Cascade Glacier accumulated smaller than normal winter snowpacks during water years 2004 and 2005 .
 2004 and 2005 maximum winter snow balances of South Cascade Glacier, 2.08 and 1.97 meters water equivalent, respectively, were smaller than the average of such balances since 1959 . The balance years 2004 and . 2005 maximum snow balances were smaller .
 The 2004 glacier summer balance was the eleventh most negative during 1959 to 2005 . The 2005 glacier summer was the third most negative in 1959-2005 . The 2004 Glacier summer balance in 2004 was the 11th most negative .
 The relatively small winter snow balances and unusually negative summer balances of 2004 and 2005 led to an overall loss of glacier mass . The relatively smaller snow balances led to the loss of ice mass .
 The 2004 and 2005 glacier net balances, -1.65 and -2.45 meters water equivalent, respectively, were the seventh and second most negative during 1953 to 2005 . The glacier net balance was 7th and 2nd most negative in the period of 1953-2005 .
 The accumulation area ratio was less than 0.05 and the equilibrium line altitude was higher than the glacier . For both balance years, the accumulation area ratios were less than .05 . The equilibrium line line altitude is higher than that glacier .
 The unusually negative 2004 and 2005 glacier net balances, combined with a negative balance previously reported for 2003, resulted in a cumulative 3-year net balance of -6.20 meters water equivalent . This is a combined negative 2003 and 2004 glacier balances .
 No equal or greater 3-year mass loss has occurred previously during the more than 4 decades of United States Geological Survey mass-balance measurements at South Cascade Glacier .

 The metal-oxo M4O4 ""cubane"" topology is of special significance to the field of water oxidation . It represents merging of bioinspired structural principles derived from natural photosynthesis with successful artificial catalysts known to date .
 We directly compare the rates of water oxidation/O2 evolution catalyzed by six cobalt-oxo clusters using the common Ru3/S2O8 photo-oxidant assay . The Co4O4 cubanes, Co44O444 and Co4 O444
 At pH 8, the first-order rate constants for these cubanes differ by 2-fold, 0.030 and 0.015 s, respectively, reflecting the number of labile carboxylate sites that allow substrate water binding in a pre-equilibrium step before O2
 Kinetic results reveal deprotonation step occurs on this pathway and that two electrons are removed before O2 evolution occurs .
 The Co4O4 cubane core is shown to be the smallest catalytic unit for the intramolecular water oxidation pathway . The core is found capable of evolving O2, despite having the same ligand sets as their cubane counterparts .
 Electrochemical studies reveal that oxidation of both cubanes to formally Co4 occurs readily, while neither dimers nor trimers are oxidized below 1.0 . Electrochemicals studies show that oxidation is readily, with neither dimer nor trimer being oxidized .

 Energetic materials constitute quite a large class of compounds with a high amount of stored chemical energy that can be released . The energy stored in these compounds can be used to release more energy .
 We hereby use a combination of quantum chemistry methods to investigate the properties of carbon-nitrogen cubanes and multi-charged polynitrogen cations in the context of their synthesis .
 The stored energy increases gradually with the nitrogen content increase . We show that the stored energy is increased gradually with nitrogen content .
 Nitrogen-poor cubanes retain their stabilities in vacuum, even at elevated temperatures . Nitrogen poor cubanes keep stability in vacuum even in high temperatures .
 In turn, polynitrogen cations are highly unstable, except N8H+, which are isoelectronic to all-carbon cubane . In turn they are unstable in turn, they are also unstable to all carbon cubane, which is also unstable .
 Kinetic stability of the cation decays drastically as its total charge increases . The stability of a cation's stability decays as it increases its charge levels .
 Large amounts of energy are liberated upon decompositions of polynitrogen cations, which produce molecular nitrogen, acetylene, and protons . High-level thermodynamic calculations revealed that large amounts of . energy were liberated .
 The present results bring a substantial insights to the design of novel high-energy compounds . The study was published in the journal Nature Biotechnology .

 The 1997-1998 El Nino is one of the strongest events of the century . It is comparable in magnitude to the 1982-1983 episode . It was an anomalous increase in sea-surface temperature across the eastern and central tropical Pacific Ocean .
 The major impact of the SST change has been the shift in the convection pattern from the western to the eastern Pacific affecting the response of rain-producing cumulonimbus . The shift in convection patterns has been seen in the Pacific .
 There has been a significant increase in rainfall over the eastern Pacific and a decrease over the western Pacific and Indonesia . As a result of the increase, there has also been a decrease in rainfall in the western and eastern Pacific .
 The dryness in the Indonesian region has contributed to large-scale burning by uncontrolled wildfires in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo . Unmanualized wildfires have been blamed for large scale fires in the region .
 These conclusions are qualitatively consistent with the changes in atmospheric circulation derived from zonal and vertical wind data obtained from the Goddard Earth Observing System .

 Nucleation rate computation from molecular simulations of TIP4P/2005 water model . Water model is based on molecular simulations from TIP 4P/ 2005 water model.
 We found that the stability of any cluster, even if large, strongly depends on energetic interactions with its vicinity . The stable clusters change their composition almost entirely during nucleation .
 Our nucleation rates are found to be 1.08×10 27 cm -3 s -1 for TIP4P/2005 . We also found to have a nucleation rate of 2.30x 27cm -3s -1 .
 The latter model prescribes a faster dynamics than the former, with a nucleation rate two times larger due to its higher electrostatic charges . The nucleation rates are also two times higher due to the higher electro static charges .
 Non-equilibrium water densities derived from simulations and state-of-art equilibrium parameters from Vega and de Miguel are used for the classical nucleation theory prediction .

 We demonstrate that the Co 2 2 cubane may be electrochemically generated . The electronic properties of this unique high-valent state may be probed by in situ spectroscopy .
 The Co 2 2 cubane has a larger reorganization energy and a smaller electron transfer rate constant for the doubly versus singly oxidized cubane . The cubane is found to have a smaller reorganization rate constant .
 Spectroelectrochemical X-ray absorption data further reveal systematic spectral changes with successive oxidations from the cubane resting state .
 Electronic structure calculations correlated to experimental data suggest that this state is best represented as a localized, antiferromagnetically coupled Co 2 dimer .
 The exchange coupling in the cofacial Co 2 site allows for parallels to be drawn between the electronic structure of the Co 4 O 4 cubane model system and the high-valent active site of Co-OEC . There is specific emphasis on the manifestation of a doubly oxid

 We employ the TIP4P/2005 water model and show that this model reproduces qualitatively the LDA-HDA transformations observed experimentally . We also show that the water model can be used to simulate the transformations of a water system .
 At the rates explored, the HDA-to-LDA transformation is less pronounced than in experiments . The HDA to LDA transformation was also less pronounced in experiments, researchers say .
 We construct a ""P-T phase diagram"" for glassy water that is consistent with experiments and remarkably similar to that previously reported previously for ST2 water .
 This phase diagram is not inconsistent with the possibility of TIP4P/2005 water exhibiting a liquid-liquid phase transition at low temperatures . Water may also exhibit a liquid liquid liquid phase transition .
 A comparison with previous MD simulation studies of SPC/E and ST2 water as well as experiments indicates that, overall, the TIP4P/2005 model performs better than the SPC/.E, ST2 models .

 The value of the biological control, the difference between street trees in good foliage condition and trees with poor foliage, was $58,766,166 . The value is the difference in good and poor foliage condition .
 If thrips damage reduced the foliage to very poor condition, the value of biological control was $73,402,683 . The value of the biological control is $73.402,000,000 .
 The benefit accrued for every dollar spent on the biological control of the thrips ranged from $950, to $1,187, if the foliage was in very poor condition .
 Economic analyses that clearly demonstrate the very substantial rates of return on investment in successful biological control in urban forests provide compelling arguments for supporting future efforts .

 Cuba, despite poor economic performance, has achieved and sustained health indices comparable to those in developed countries--the Cuban Paradox . It is widely recognized that Cuba's health indices are comparable to that of developed countries .
 Cuba's exclusion from the mainstream of ""globalization,"" allows us to gain insights into the population health impact of policies that have accompanied globalization . Cuba is excluded from the global mainstream of "globalization"
 Cuba's experience challenges the conventional assumption that generating wealth is the fundamental precondition for improving health . Cuba's experiences challenge the notion of generating wealth as a key to improving health, says CNN.com .
 As peoples around the world search for cost-effective ways to improve well-being, they might want to learn how alternative public policy approaches, such as those used in Cuba .
 We reviewed the literature on the health-wealth relationship in this globalizing era . Then systematically examined public policy in Cuba, not only for health services but for non-medical determinants of health .
 Cuban system has generated social cohesion in Cuba, including education, housing, nutrition, employment, etc. plus the community mobilization and social cohesion that it has generated .
 It appears that the active implementation of public policy affecting a wide variety of health determinants explains the Cuban paradox . The international community can learn from Cuba's experience, says Dr. David Perry .
 The prospect for healthy public policy can thus exist within, rather than only on the margins of globalization, can be found in the U.S.
 The importance of monitoring how Cuba sustains such policies as it faces growing challenges in this globalizing era is increasingly worth observing . Cuba's policies are increasingly important to monitoring, says the Cuban government .

 The cytotoxic effects of brown Cuban propolis depend on the nemorosone content and may be mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling . Program directors of all known existing school programs have been contacted by scientists .
 In this study, brown Cuban propolis extracts were found cytotoxic against HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, in close association with the nemorosone contents . The study was published in the journal Nature Biologia .
 In mitochondria isolated from rat liver the extracts displayed uncoupling activity . This was demonstrated by the increase in succinate-supported state 4 respiration rates and Ca release .
 The degree of mitotoxic events was closely correlated to the nemorosone content . As in cells, the degree of such mitotoxoxoxactions was closely linked to the presence of nemosone .
 Propolis extracts that do not contain nemorosone were neither cytotoxic nor mitotoxic, except R-29, whose detrimental effect upon cells and mitochondria could be mediated by its isoflavonoids and chalcones components, well known mitochondrial uncouplers
 Our results at least partly unravel the cytotoxic mechanism of Cuban propolis, particularly regarding brown propolis . We raise concerns about the toxicological implication of consuming the propolis of Cuban Propolis .

 ERIC Educational Resources Information Center . Eckstein, Susan; Barberia, Lorena . 2002-01-01 Investigated differences in views and involvements between two cohorts of first generation Cuban-American immigrants .
 Interviews with immigrants indicated that the first wave left between 1959-1979 mainly for political reasons and publicly opposes travel to Cuba . The first wave of Cuban immigrants left Cuba mainly because of political reasons .
 The real objectives may be more symbolic than practical . The Cuba embargo is supposed to bring about the Castro regime's compliance or collapse . The U.S. has a long history of anti-Castro sentiment .
 Heterometallic appended {MMn4} cubanes encapsulated by lacunary polytungstate ligands . Ultimately, the institutional completeness provided by the enclave in South Florida insulates and… insulates .
 The heterometallic appended {MMn} and K) cubanes were firstly trapped by two diamagnetic POM shells, which were robust enough to construct inorganic crystalline tubular materials . They were then trapped by the diamagnetic shells .
 In the autumn of 1997, the United States Geological Survey re-established two wetlands with different shallow water depths . The wetlands are intended to study the potential to reverse subsidence of delta islands .
 Water temperature was recorded from July 2005 to February 2008 in the deeper of the two wetlands . The study was done to assess differences in water temperature between the two vegetation types .
 Water temperature was compared at three depths in the water column between areas of emergent and submerged vegetation and between areas near the water inflow and in wetland interior .
 The comparison was a way of evaluating the effect of the length of time water had resided in the wetland on water temperatures . The latter comparison was used to evaluate the effect .
 There were statistically significant differences in water temperature at all depths between the two vegetation types .
 In areas of emergent marsh vegetation, the mean water temperature at the surface was 1.2 degrees Celsius less than it was in areas of submerged vegetation . When analyses accounted for the changes in temperature due to seasonal and diurnal cycles, differences in the temperature between the vegetation types were even
 In the spring, the mean temperatures in emergent marsh vegetation at the surface, mid-point, and near the sediment in the water column were 2.0, 2.3, and 2.5 degrees .
 Mgal/d in freshwater discharge to offshore areas was a net increase of 6.6.4m/d . The increase was in part due to an increase in the amount of freshwater discharge from offshore areas .

 The 1995 pumpage rate applied to the 1945-2005 transient simulation caused average water-level declines of 5 and 8 ft in the shallow and deep aquifer systems from predevelopment conditions, respectively, a net decrease of 13 ft .
 The simulated decrease in freshwater discharge to the offshore areas caused saltwater intrusion in two parts of the deep aquifer system under Manhasset Neck . The simulated decreases in freshwater .
 Saline ground water simulated in a third part of the deep aquifer system under Manhasset Neck was due to the absence of the North Shore confining unit near Sands Point . Saline groundwater was simulated in the area .
 The oxo-cobalt cubane unit is of interest as a homogeneous oxygen-evolution reaction catalyst, and as a functional mimic of heterogeneous cobalt oxide OER catalysts .
 The synthesis of several new cubanes allows evaluation of redox potentials for the cluster, which are highly sensitive to the ligand environment and span a remarkable range of 1.42 V . The 4+/5+ and 5+/ 6+ redox Potentials are reliably predicted
 The potential-p K a correlation is used to evaluate the feasibility of various proposed OER catalytic intermediates, including high-valent Co-oxo species .
 The synthetic methods and structure–reactivity relationships developed by these studies should better guide the design of new cubane-based OER catalysts . Study: Synthetic control and empirical prediction of redox potentials for Co 4O 4 cubanes .
 Cuban engagement could prove particularly significant for health systems development in the region . Given the small populations of PICs, the Cuban engagement is particularly significant .
 This paper reviews the magnitude of Cuban medical cooperation in the Pacific . It analyses its implications for health policy, human resource capacity and overall development assistance for health in the region .
 We reviewed both published and grey literature on health workforce in the Pacific including health workforce plans and human resource policy documents . Methods were used to test the effectiveness of the Pacific health workforce .
 Further information was gathered through discussions with key stakeholders involved in health workforce development in the region . Further information will be gathered from discussions with stakeholders .
 Cuba formalised its relationship with PICs in September 2008 following the first Cuba-Pacific Islands ministerial meeting . The first meeting was held in Cuba in 2008 in Havana .
 The cost of the Cuban medical cooperation to PICs comes in the form of countries providing benefits and paying allowances to in-country Cuban health workers and return airfares for their students .
 PICs seen by some as a cheaper alternative to training doctors in other countries . This has been seen as an alternative training programme .
 Cuban engagement with PICs presents several opportunities and challenges for health system strengthening in the region . Conclusions: The Cuban engagement is smaller than engagement with other countries, but presents several challenges for strengthening .
 It allows PICs to increase their health workforce numbers at relatively low cost . It also extends delivery of health services to remote areas, says PIC chief .
 Analysis of Data From the National Health Interview Survey, 1997–2005 . Findings were published in 2009-01-01 Objective .
 I estimated the association between race and self-reported hypertension among Hispanics and non-Hispanics . I also determined whether this association was stronger among non-Hispanic Americans . I found that the association was more pronounced among people living in the United States .
 With data from the 1997–2005 National Health Interview Survey, I used logistic regression to estimate the strength of the association between race/ethnicity and self-reported hypertension .
 Non-Hispanic Blacks had 48% greater odds of reporting hypertension compared with non-Hispanic Whites . Hispanic Whites had 23% lower odds .
 The previously reported hypertension advantage of Hispanics holds for Hispanic Whites only . The hypertension advantage was previously reported .
 As Hispanics continue their rapid growth in the United States, race may have important implications on their disease burden . Most U.S health disparities are driven by race and its socially patterned experiences, authors say .

 Mn4O3Cl complexes containing three or six terminal Cl ligands at three of the Mn were included in this study . In addition to the study, the study also found that the complexes contain Cl ligand ligands .
 The extended X-ray absorption fine structure of these Mn compounds also displays superficial resemblance to that of PS II . However, major differences emerge on closer examination of the phases and amplitudes .
 The most obvious distinction is the smaller magnitude of the Fourier transform of the PS II EXAFS compared to the FTs from the distorted cubanes . The FTs are smaller than those from distorted cubane .
 Curve fitting of the Mn EXAFS spectra verifies the known core structures of Mn cubanes . The number of crucial 2. and 3. is crucial .
 The annual linear rate of mean sea level rise in the Cuban archipelago has fluctuated between 0.005 cm/year at Casilda and 0.214 cm/ year at Siboney .
 The main sea level rise effects for the Cuban coastal zone due to climate change and global warming are shown . Sea level rise is due to increase in sea levels due to global warming and climate change .
 Monthly and annual mean sea level anomalies, some of which are similar to or higher than sea level rise estimated for halfway through the present century, reinforce the inland seawater penetration . Semi-daily high tide .
 The combination of these different events will result in the loss of goods and services, and require expensive investments for adaption . The combined events will lead to an increase in the cost of adapting to the new climate, experts say .

 Waterborne diaseases outbreaks have still been observed even in industrialized countries . Despite considerable advances in drinking water safety assurance and adherence to the public health standards, waterborne diases outbreaks still occur in industrialized nations .
 The study objective was to map such outbreaks in the Czech Republic in 1995-2005 . The study was based on the findings of a study conducted by the University of Prague .
 A waterborne disease is a disease where water is the vehicle or source of infection . An outbreak is the occurrence of more cases of disease than normally expected within a specific place over a given period of time .
 The data was obtained from the EPIDAT database information provided by epidemiologists of all regional public health authorities .
 In 1995 2005, 33 outbreaks with water indicated as the route of transmission were recorded in the Czech Republic . 33 outbreaks of water-related disease have been recorded .
 The leading cause was unsafe drinking water , mainly from wells . The most serious consequences were observed in two outbreaks caused by microbiologically contaminated hot water .
 Other sources of waterborne infection were mineral water springs, a swimming pool and a brook . Waterborne infection was also a source of infection in the area .
 The highest number of outbreaks as well as the highest number were reported in 1997 . The most cases of the disease were reported to be in 1997, when the outbreak was first reported .
 Comparison of two five-year periods,e.96-2000 and 2001-2005, showed a nearly one third decrease in the total of outbreaks and a half reduction in the cases in the latter .
 In view of the limited length of monitoring, it is not possible to say with certainty whether it is a random distribution or actual trend .
 Almost two thirds of cases were diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis of probable infectious origin . Other frequent waterborne diseases were viral hepatitis A and bacillary dysentery .
 Streamflow, water-quality, and biological conditions in the Big Black Creek basin, St. St. Louis County, Louisiana, were analyzed .
 Data obtained during these synoptic investigations provide a one-time look at the streamflow and water-quality conditions in the Big Black Creek Basin during a stable, base-flow period .
 Data were used to assess the degree of water-quality degradation in the Big Black Creek Basin from land-use activities in the basin, including leakage of leachate .
 Biological data from the benthic invertebrate community investigation provided an assessment of the cumulative effects of stream conditions on organisms in the basin .
 Synoptic measurement of streamflow at 28 sites was made during a period of baseflow on August 27, 1997 . The synoptic measurements were made in August 1997 .
 Two stream reaches above the landfill lost water to the ground-water system, but those below the landfill had significantly higher ground-waters gains . Two streams above landfill lose water to ground water system .
 If significant leakage of leachate from the landfill had occurred during the measurement period, the distribution of ground-water discharge suggests it would travel relatively short distances before resurfacing as ground-wading discharge to the stream . Leakate would then be re-used as ground water discharge
 Benthic invertebrate communities at the sites sampled were considered unimpaired or only slightly impaired during the sample period . Based on Alabama Department of Environmental Management criteria .
 This would imply that landfill and coal-mining activities did not have a detrimental effect on the benthic invertebrate communities at the time of the study .

 Despite ongoing efforts to protect species and ecosystems in Cuba, habitat degradation, overuse and introduction of alien species pose serious challenges .
 Recent results suggest that we are far from having a complete picture of the Cuban freshwater fish diversity . In spite of the accumulated knowledge on the systematics of this freshwater ichthyofauna, recent results suggested that we still need to learn more about the species .
 It is estimated that 40% of freshwater Cuban fish are endemic . However, this number may be even higher . The number of endemic Cuban fish is thought to be higher .
 Analysis was based on Kimura 2-parameter genetic distances . For four genera a character-based analysis was also used to analyse the species .
 The mean conspecific, congeneric and confamiliar genetic distances were 0.6%, 9.1% and 20.2% respectively . The mean genetic distance was 0.4% and 0.7% .
 Molecular species identification was in concordance with current taxonomical classification in 96.4% of cases . In all but one instance, members of a given genera clustered within the same clade .
 Within the genus Gambusia, genetic divergence analysis suggests that there may be at least four cryptic species . The species is thought to be four cryptic forms .
 Low genetic divergence and a lack of diagnostic sites suggest Rivulus insulaepinorum may be conspecific with Rivulus cylindraceus . In contrast, low genetic divergence suggests that Rivulus . cylindracus. Rivulus.insulpinorum .
 Distance and character-based analysis were completely concordant, suggesting that they complement species identification . The results suggest that distance and character analysis are more likely to complement each other's identification .
 DNA barcodes are useful for cataloguing Cuban freshwater fish species, scientists say . The barcodes were used to identify those groups that deserve further taxonomic attention . Overall, the results showed the usefulness of the barcodes .

 Calisto occulta sp. sp., described from the northeastern Cuban mountains . A new species of Calisti occulta has been described in Cuba as a new species . The species is a species of species that is endemic to Cuba .
 Calisto smintheus Bates, 1935 and Calisti bruneri, Michener 1949 are revised and revalidated . The original versions of this article are published in the following year .
 A new status, the species level, is proposed for Calisto brochei, Torre 1973, Caliste muripetens, Bates 1939 and Calisti bradleyi, Munroe 1950 . A new species level is proposed .
 The immature stages of Calisto smintheus are described for the first time . Calisti herophile, Hübner 1823 is redescribed . The immature stage stages are also described .
 Useful morphological characters for adults are the shape and conspicuousness of androconial patch, the number and relative size of white dots on underside of hindwing . The shape of aedeagus, the shape of digitiform projection of genitalia valve, the size of tegumen
 For the immature stages, the most important characters are the color pattern of head capsule, the number and width of longitudinal lines of body, in the larvae . The color pattern and the absence or presence of dorsal ridges on the abdomen of pupae are important for immature stages .
 The phylogenetic relationships between the Cuban Calisto species are quite robust and well-supported . However, conflict between mitochondrial and nuclear datasets was detected in three of the species . Conflict was also found in three species .
 Chemical analysis of plant material at the site was investigated as a preliminary tool to determine the extent of contamination . Chemical analysis was used as a pre-emptive tool to find out if contamination was caused by the site .
 Thirty soil samples were collected from 15 soil cores during October 2005 and analyzed for trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds . The samples were analyzed for traces of trace elements, organic compounds and trace elements .
 Ground-water samples were collected during December 2005 and May 2006 and analyzed for trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds . Five small-diameter, polyvinyl-chloride-cased wells were installed .
 Thirty Johnsongrass samples and 16 Coralberry samples were collected during September 2005 and analyzed for 53 constituents, including trace elements, were collected .
 Areas of trace element and semivolatile organic compound contamination are located in the shallow soils near the threading barn . Results of the soil, ground-water, and plant data indicate that the areas of contamination were located in .
 Most trace-element concentrations in the soils on the study site were either similar to or less than trace-Element concentrations in background soils . The study site is located near the site of the study .
 Several trace elements and semivolatile organic compounds exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Human Health Medium-Specific Screening Levels 2007 for Tap Water, Residential Soils, Industrial Indoor Soils and Industrial Outdoor Soils .
 There was little or no correlation between plant and soil sample concentrations and the plant and ground-water concentrations based on the current sample size .
 Plant sampling was not useful as a preliminary tool to assess contamination at the study site . The lack of correlation between trace-element concentrations in plants and soils and plants and ground water indicate that plant sampling is not useful for the study .
 To assess the direct inputs during inundation, pesticide concentrations were analyzed in water, in suspended and bed-sediment samples collected from six source watersheds to the Yolo Bypass, and from three sites within the Bypass .
 Water samples were collected in February 2004 from the six input sites to the Bypass during the first flood event of the year representing pesticide inputs during high-flow events .
 Samples were also collected along a transect across the Bypass in early March 2004 and from three sites within the ByPass in the spring of 2004 under low-flow conditions .
 Low-flow data were used to understand potential pesticide contamination and its effects on native fish if water was used to flood the Bypass in dry years .
 To assess loads of pesticides to the Bypass associated with suspended sediments, large-volume water samples were collected during high flows in 2004 and 2005 from three sites . Bed sediments were collected in the fall of 2004 during the dry season .
 Thirteen current-use pesticides were detected in surface water samples collected during the study . Pesticides were found to be present in water samples .
 The highest pesticide concentrations detected at the input sites to the Bypass corresponded to the first high-flow event of the year . Pesticide concentrations were found to be at the highest levels of pesticide concentration in the area .
 The highest pesticide concentrations at the two sites sampled within the Bypass during the early spring were detected in mid-April following a major flood event as the water began to subside .
 The pesticides detected and their concentrations varied by site . Hexazinone and simazine were detected at all sites and at some of the highest concentrations .
 13 current-use pesticides and three organochlorine insecticides were detected in bed and suspended sediments collected in 2004 and 2005 .
 Anglo-American and Cuban-American Teachers' Perception of Elementary School Boys and Girls . Pesticides detected and their concentrations varied by site and sediment .
 The attitudes of Cubanand Anglo-American elementary school teachers concerning boys and girls were compared . The attitudes were compared by Cuban and American teachers .

 The characteristics presented for the long-term continuous-record stations are minimum daily streamflow; average daily stream flow; harmonic mean flow . 1-, 7-, 30-, 30- and 90-day minimum average low flow with 2-, 5-, 10-, 10-year recurrence intervals .
 The characteristics presented for the low-flow partial-record stations are minimum observed streamflow; estimated 1-, 7-, 30-, and 90-day minimum average low flow with 2-, 10-, and 20-year recurrence intervals; and estimated 98-, 95-, 90-90-90
 The site is also the location of huge freshwater diversion facilities that entrain large numbers of fish .
 Reducing the entrainment of listed fishes into these facilities has required curtailment of pumping, reducing the reliability of water deliveries . The water supply has been reduced to less than 50 per cent of water supply .
 Environmental Water Account is a program to resolve conflicts between protecting listed fish and providing a reliable water supply . We reviewed the first 5 years of the program . The program has been in place for 5 years .
 The EWA provided fishery agencies with control over 0.2-0.2 km3 of water to be used for fish protection at no cost to users of exported water . Fishery agencies guaranteed no disruption of water supply for protection .
 The EWA was successful in reducing uncertainty in water supply . However, its contribution to the recovery of listed fishes was unclear .
 Allocating water for a single life stage of one species could provide larger gains in survival . Allocating EWA water for one life stage could help save one species from extinction .
 An optimally allocated EWA of equal size to the median of the first 5 years could increase abundance of juvenile delta smelt up to 7% in the springs of dry years .
 If the EWA is to become a long-term program, estimates of efficacy should be refined . The EWA program has been criticized for being too restrictive .
 The average annual rice WF for the years 2005-2014 was about 7,580 m3/ton, of which 80% was blue, 17% was green, and 3% was grey . The research results indicate that . 80% of the rice was blue and 17% green
 This average annual footprint was about 5. times larger than the 2000-2004 average annual WF of rice for countries around the globe of 1325 m3/ton, of which 48% was green, 44% was blue, and 8% was grey .
 The blue WF is the most important source of water for rice production in Taiwan . Taiwan's water supply is used to make rice and other rice crops .
 The water consumption of the second crop is higher than that of the first crop . The second crop was also higher in terms of its water consumption than the first .
 The water use efficiency in the southern region of Taiwan is the best, while the northern part of Taiwan exhibits relatively high inefficiency .
 The rates of change in cultivated land and rice production in Taiwan are decreasing in a stable manner . Taiwan's rice production has been a stable trend in recent years .
 The nexus of land, water, and food should be taken into consideration to protect water availability, maintain agricultural production, and avoid land degradation .
 The results could offer useful information for agriculture policy and water resource management .
 The impact of a poor iron status on the difficulties to keep recruitment of new donors at pace with the ongoing increased demand for blood transfusions was studied by comparing the iron status of donors recruited in 1993-1997 and 2005-2006 .
 In women, there was a significant fall in haemoglobin and serum ferritin mean values from 13. to 13. g/dl and from 30. to 26. microg/l .
 Iron status of women who want to serve as blood donors has deteriorated in the last 10 years . Increased rejection due to haemoglobin below the inclusion criterion .
 In order to assess the water-quality data, the data were related to land use/land cover in the watershed . The data was based on land use and land cover in a watershed .
 Data from 81 water-quantity and water-quality sites were available for analysis . Data included 9 ground water sites and 72 surface-water sites . Water quality and water quality data from 81 sites were analyzed .
 The Fraser River flows about 28 miles from its headwaters at the Continental Divide to the confluence with the Colorado River .
 Ground-water resources in the watershed are used for residential and municipal drinking-water supplies . Ground-waters are used to supply drinking water supplies to residents and businesses .

 Data were gathered from seven of eight High Rate X-Tags deployed on mature Cuban dogfish in the Exuma Sound, The Bahamas . The data was gathered from 7 of 8 High Rate x-tags deployed .
 Recovery periods appeared variable between individuals and were likely driven by capture-and-handling stress and tag burden . Recovery periods were also variable between animals and humans .
 Three of the seven individuals suffered mortality through predation, which occurred during daytime . Cuban dogfish may constitute a proportion of deep-water apex predator diet in Exuma Sound .
 Cuban dogfish are diel-vertical migrators, similar to other deep-water taxa . They exhibit a relatively broad temperature and depth range, which may be driven by preference for specific bathymetric structures .
 These techniques provide an important first step into acquiring and presenting vertical habitat data for small-bodied, deep-water chondrichthyans, which can be directly applied to fisheries and ecosystem-based management approaches .

 The impact of the 2003 summer heat wave and the 2005 late cold wave on the phytoplankton in the north-eastern English Channel is shown .
 Phytoplankton composition was investigated at two fixed stations in the north-eastern English Channel from November 1997 to December 2005 .
 The warmest temperatures in European historical records were recorded in August 2003 . August 2003 was the warmest temperature in European history .
 This event was associated with an exceptional abundance peak of the dinoflagellates Akashiwo sanguinea and Ceratium fusus .
 The lowest February temperatures for the 1998-2005 period were recorded in 2005, coinciding with the absence of the . first time in recent decades, of the spring bloom of Phaeocystis globosa .
 The 'de-eutrophication' is progressively reducing the magnitude of the Phaeocystis blooms . The reduction of river nutrient loads is reducing the size of the blooms in the region .
 The delay in spring stratification, lower light availability due to turbidity and organic matter, and competition with tychoplanktonic diatoms contributed to retard the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom .
 The summer 2003 European heat wave is expected to have had little influence on total annual primary production . It occurred at mid-summer, the period of lowest annual phytoplankton abundance, because it occurred during mid summer .
 Anomalous weather in the second half of winter 2005 affected the annual primary production . However, the anomalous weather did not affect the annual production .

 Water shows intriguing thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies in the supercooled liquid state . Water has been shown to be a key component of the study of water supercooling .
 One possible explanation of origin of these anomalies lies in the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid phase transition between two forms of water .
 The existence of a LLPT in water is still debated . While the anomalies are observed in experiments on bulk and confined water and by computer simulation studies of different water-like models .
 Computer simulations of water models are crucial for exploring the possibility of the metastable LLPT and the nature of the anomalies .
 In this work, we present new simulation results in the NVT ensemble for one of the most accurate classical molecular models of water, TIP4P/2005 . The results are based on a simulation of the TIP3/2005 model .
 The results suggest the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point . The results are consistent with the existence of a LLPT in this model .
 We have compared the behavior of TIP4P/2005 with other popular water-like models, namely, mW and ST2, and with real water, all of which are well described by two-state thermodynamics .
 In view of the current debate involving different studies of TIP4P/2005, we discuss consequences of metastability and finite size in observing liquid-liquid separation .

 The change in the North Atlantic Deep Water has complicated spatial structure and is almost indistinguishable from zero at 95% confidence . In contrast, the change in . the North . Atlantic Deep . Water has more complex spatial structure .
 The resulting divergence in vertical displacement of the isopycnals modifies the local density stratification . The resulting diverging in vertical displacements modifies local densities .
 Local squared buoyancy frequency near the canyon is reduced by about 20% from 1997 to 2014 . At its peak, the local squared buoyance frequency was at its peak .
 Similar reduction is found in the basinwide averaged profiles over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge flank along 25°W in years 1989, 2005, and 2014 . Similar reduction was found over the mid-Atlantic ridge flank in 1989 and 2005 . Similar reductions are found in basinwide averages .
 The observed changes in density stratification have important implications for internal tide generation and dissipation, say scientists .

 The barrier to decomposition is found to be about 9 kcal/mol . The barrier is not limited by the singlet triplet crossing .
 Cyclic O3 photochemically is formed by the crossings between the lowest five surfaces A, sA, A, B, and B . The crossings of the lowest 5 surfaces A and sA provide some insight into ways to form cyclic . O3 is a cyclic O

 We have studied the decomposition pathways for cubane to benzene plus acetylene and to cyclooctatetraene . The decomposition of cubane and benzene has been studied in the past .
 We have studied ground and excited states for the photochemical ring closure step . We have also studied the excited states of the photochemicals .
 The state which closes to cubane can be described as a double triplet pi to pi* excitation with respect to the ground state . It is a triplet state of a double-triplet Pi to Pi* .
 This state has only a small oscillator strength with respect to the ground state . Thus, this state has just a small . oscillator . strength .
 There is a singlet pi to pi* state at nearly the same energy and excitation to this state followed by intersystem crossing could lead to the triplet pi topi* state . However, there is also a state where the energy levels are nearly identical .
 The computed Tolman length agrees quite well with a previous study of TIP4P/2005 water water . The study was published in 2005 .

 We discuss critical assumptions which lead to these findings and their relation to experiments on the nucleation of water droplets . We also discuss the role of experiments on nucleation .
 We also discuss surface broken bonds and structural correlations as possible explanations for the energetic and entropic contributions to the universe . This is also discussed in our new book, The Theory of Evolution .
 The aim of this paper is to evaluate the intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis patterns from Cuba's and Ecuador's patients with angiostrongyliasis . 8 Ecuadorian patients from two different outbreaks and 28 Cuban patients were studied .
 Immunoglobulin A, IgM, IgG, and albumin were quantified by radial immunodiffusion . immunoglobululin A was quantified using radial immunoology . immunodiffsusion was used to measure immunoglobin .
 A three-Ig pattern was the most frequent in the two groups, but IgM was presented in all Ecuadorian young mature patients . In the Cuban children, only 12 of 28 patients had intrathecal IgM, but about 90% had an IgA and IgG synthesis
 This indicates that, with a larger amount of parasites ingested, clinical symptoms are more severe, and a higher frequency of intrathecal IgM synthesis could be observed . This indicates a larger number of parasites could cause clinical symptoms to be severe .
 This is discussed as a similarity with the intrathecal IgM synthesis in African trypanosomiasis . This is similar to the IgM syntheses used to develop the skin graft .

 The model simulates the timing, duration, and relative size of algal blooms with sufficient accuracy to provide important insights for regulators and managers of this river .
 About half of the error in the simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations is directly attributable to error in size of the simulated phytoplankton population . About half the error is attributable to errors in the size and size of a phyoplankon population .
 Future efforts may include the introduction of multiple algal groups in the model . To achieve greater accuracy in simulating dissolved oxygen, it will be necessary .

 Captive breeding is a widespread conservation strategy, yet such programs rarely include empirical genetic data for assessing management assumptions and meeting conservation goals . The study was published in the journal Nature Conservation .
 Cuban Amazon parrots are considered vulnerable, and multiple on-island captive populations have been established from wild-caught and confiscated individuals of unknown ancestry .
 Using Bayesian clustering analysis, we detected 2 distinct clusters within the Zapata population, one of which was shared with Managua . One of the clusters was found to be shared with one of Zapata populations .
 Overall mean kinship was low within each captive population, with 19 and 11 recommended breeding pairs in Zapata and Managua, respectively, ranked according to mean .
 The results highlight the importance of understanding population history within ex situ management programs, while providing genetic information to help Cuban parrot conservation .

 The striking behavior of water has deserved it to be referred to as an ""anomalous"" liquid . Water has been described as an 'anomalyous' liquid .
 Beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily transforms into the stable one . This makes difficult to a complete experimental description since .
 Theoretical interpretation of the water anomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water models . Water anomalies could be interpreted by well validated models, experts say .
 One of the most popular theoretical scenarios-involving the existence of a liquid-liquid critical point-is disputed by several authors . In particular, several authors have doubts about whether there is a liquid critical point .
 In this work, we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic relations which may shed light on this issue .
 These relations may be tested in a region of the phase diagram which is outside the LLCP thus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region .
 We have performed computer simulations to evaluate the TMD and TmD for a successful water model, namely, TIP4P/2005 . The model is based on a water model that was developed in 2005 .
 We have evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative pressures . We have also evaluated the vapour-liquid spinsodal .
 The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of some response functions, in particular the isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant pressure, provides very useful information which may help to elucidate the validity of theoretical proposals .
 In this way, we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of the thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the vapor-liquid spinodal . The study was published in the journal of the International Meteorological Association .
 The overall picture shows a remarkable similarity with the corresponding one for the ST2 water model, for which the existence of a LLCP has been demonstrated in recent years .

 Study used several methods to identify mixing zones of ground and geothermal waters using trace elements, chemical equilibria, water temperature, and geothermometer estimates .
 Geothermal sources influence the chemical quality of ground water used for drinking water supplies in some regions . In some regions, geothermal sources can influence the quality of water supplies .
 The Environmental Protection Agency has established primary drinking water standards for these, with the exception of boron and lithium . The EPA has set up primary drinking standards for the most common chemicals .
 Some trace metals in geothermal water may exceed drinking water standards by several orders of magnitude . Concentrations of some trace metals may exceed water standards . Geothermal water could be contaminated with other metals .
 Geothermal influences on water quality are likely to be localized, depending on directions of ground water flow . The relative volumes of geothermal sources and ground water originating from other sources, and depth below the surface from which water is withdrawn .
 It is important to understand the areal extent of shallow mixing of geothermal water because it may have adverse chemical and aesthetic effects on domestic drinking water .
 Multispectral satellite-imagery and National Wetlands Inventory data are used to delineate evaporative ground-water discharge areas on the Death Valley floor .

 OSBPL10, RXRA and lipid metabolism confer African-ancestry protection against dengue haemorrhagic fever in admixed Cubans . OSB PL10 and RXRA confer protection against the disease in the wild .
 Ethnic groups can display differential genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases . Ethnic groups may have different genetic predispositions to diseases .
 The arthropod-born viral dengue disease is one such disease, with empirical and limited genetic evidence showing that African ancestry may be protective against the haemorrhagic phenotype of the disease .
 Global ancestry analysis based on high-throughput genotyping in admixed populations can be used to test this hypothesis . Admixture mapping can map candidate protective genes, according to scientists .
 Global ancestry was ascertained through ADMIXTURE and used in a fine-matched corrected association study . Local ancestry was inferred by RFMix algorithm .
 The expression of candidate genes was evaluated by RT-PCR in a Cuban dengue patient cohort . gene set enrichment analysis was performed in a Thai dengeue transcriptome . A Thai transcriptome was also studied .
 OSBPL10 and RXRA candidate genes were identified . Most significant SNPs placed in inferred weak enhancers, promoters and lncRNAs . Most of the SNPs were placed in strong enhancers and promoters, promoters .
 OSBPL10 had significantly lower expression in Africans than Europeans . RXRA several SNPs may differentially regulate its transcription between Africans and Europeans .
 Their expression was confirmed to change through dengue disease progression in Cuban patients and to vary with disease severity in a Thai transcriptome dataset . The expression of these expressions were confirmed to have changed through disease progression .
 These genes interact in the LXR/RXR activation pathway that integrates lipid metabolism and immune functions . This pathway is a key player in dengue virus entrance into cells, its replication therein and in cytokine production .
 Knockdown of OSBPL10 expression in THP-1 cells by two shRNAs followed by DENV2 infection tests led to a significant reduction in DENV replication . This is a direct functional proof that the lower expression profile in Africans protects this ancestry against dengue disease

 A Witness to French-Cuban Cooperation in Physics in the 1970s NASA Astrophysics Data System Cernogora, Jacqueline In France in 1968 .
 Forty years later, to avoid such questions, I will say right away ""from where"" I am writing this text, which is by no means an exhaustive study of French-Cuban collaboration in physics .
 The Soviet Union offered all the participant countries the chance to make use of its space vehicles and related installations so that their cosmonauts could carry out original scientific experiments in space . The situation in Cuba had changed radically in Cuba in the 1980s .
 The experiments were the first in their class to be carried out by humans in space under microgravity conditions . They were also set up for the same space flight, but carried out during a later flight .
 The Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait is the most commonly used instrument to assess food cravings as a multidimensional construct . Food cravings can be described as a multi-dimensional construct . The questionnaire is designed to assess the person's desire to eat food .
 The 39 items have an underlying nine-factor structure for both the original English and Spanish version; but subsequent studies yielded fewer factors . Previous studies have found fewer factors in the original version .
 The current study aimed to explore the factor structure of the Spanish version for both the FCQ-T and reduced . The study was conducted in a sample of 1241 Cuban adults .
 Results showed a four-factor structure for the FCQ-T, which explained 55% of the variance . Results showed that the four factors were responsible for more than half the variance in the four factor structure .
 Using the items of the FCQ-T-reduced only showed a one-factor structure, which explained 52% of the variance . Using a one factor structure, the one factor explained only 52% .
 Both versions of the FCQ-T were positively correlated with body mass index . Body mass index, scores on the Food Thoughts Suppression Inventory and weight cycling also correlated .
 Women had higher scores than men and restrained eaters scored higher than unrestrained eaters . In addition, women were more likely to score higher than men .
 The FCQ-T factor structure structure was significantly reduced in Cuban adults . It may represent a good alternative to efficiently assess food craving on a trait level, study found .
 Standardized instruments and measures constructed for this study were pretested . The study was conducted in a controlled environment in order to make the study .
 Multivariate analyses showed that ethnic groups differed in age, education, income and number of persons giving care . Caregiver health and patient functioning were similar .
 Differences in cultural variables were small. Controlling for demographics, differences in cultural factors were small .
 The sense of obligation, emotional attachment, openness about who should give care, spirituality, spirituality and spirituality were comparable in all groups . Use of family help or community services was comparable, according to the study .

 Continuous records of surface-water discharge have been collected from 1976 to 2004 at Moenkopi Wash, 1996 to 2004 . Recordings were collected at Laguna Creek and Polacca Wash .
 Median flows for November, December, January, and February of each water year were used as an index of ground-water discharge to those streams .
 Since 1995, median winter flows have decreased for Moenkopi Wash, Dinnebito Wash, and Polacca Wash . The median winter flow has decreased since 1995 .
 Since the first continuous record of surface-water discharge in 1997, there is no consistent trend in the median winter flow for Laguna Creek . Laguna is the largest freshwater stream in the United States .
 In 2005, water samples were collected from 11 wells and 4 springs and analyzed for selected chemical constituents . Water samples from the wells and springs were collected .
 There are some long-term trends in the chemistry of water samples from 7 wells having more than 10 years of data and from 2 springs . Water samples have been taken from 7 well wells and 2 springs in the region .
 Rough Rock PM5, Keams Canyon PM2, Second Mesa PM2 and Kayenta PM2 show an increasing trend in dissolved solids . Forest Lake NTUA1 and PWCC 2 show a decreasing trend . Kykostmovi PM2 shows a steady trend .
 Increasing trends in dissolved-solids and chloride concentrations are evident from the more than 11 years of data for 2 springs . Increasing trends are evident in the more recent data for the past two springs .
 Bycatch was established as the cause of death for most of the individuals through typical indications of fisheries interactions, including net markings and loss of tail flukes .
 Local fishermen confirmed unusually large porpoise bycatch in nets set for lumpfish . Str strandings attributed to early lumpfish season . Large porpoises bycatch found in early lump fish nets .
 2005 lumpfish catches for 2005 were not unusual in terms of season onset, peak or total catch, when compared to 2003–2008 . However, lumpfish catch for 2005 was not unusual .
 Human activity was combined with environmental factors and the variation in Danish fisheries landings in a two-part statistical model to assess the correlation of these factors with the presence of fresh strandings .
 The final statistical model indicated that naval presence is correlated with higher rates of porpoise strandings, particularly in combination with certain fisheries . It is not correlated with the actual presence of strandings .
 Ships were testing equipment prior to the main exercise . Although sonar usage cannot be confirmed, it is likely that ships were testing various equipment before the exercise .
 Naval activity cannot be ruled out as a possible contributing factor . The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning .
 The economic census is the major source of facts about the structure and functioning of the Nation's economy . The census is an important source of information about the nation's economic structure .
 Inmore » this work, we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic relations which may shed light on this issue .
 The model was used to simulate possible mechanisms of contaminant release, the effect of increased pumpage from water-supply wells, and pumping at the leading edge of the plume as a possible means of remediation .
 Based on simulation of threewaste-oil lagoons, a vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0. feet per day was required to move contaminants into the bottom layer of the model . A constant leakage rate of about 98 gallons per minute was needed .
 Simulations of a disposal well in layer 3 of the model indicated an injection rate of 50 gallons per minute was necessary to spread contaminants vertically in the aquifer . Simulations showed that a 50 gallon per minute injection rate was necessary .
 Simulated pumping from hypothetical wells at the leading edge of the plume indicated that three wells, each pumping 25 gallons per minute from model layer 3, would capture the 1,4-dioxane plume .
 pH generally were near neutral to slightly alkaline throughout most of the study area with the exception of the upper Animas River Basin near Silverton where acidic conditions existed at some sites because of hydrothermal alteration and historical mining . Values of pH were generally neutral or alkaline in most of

 Scientific research cooperation between Cuba and the USA dates back to the 19th century . Cuba has a long history of cooperation with the USA .
 In the second half of the 20th century, the Cuban revolution and the escalation of the U.S. government embargo impacted every aspect of Cuban life . The Cuban revolution was the result of the United States government embargo .
 Scientific cooperation-led and facilitated by scientific organizations such as the Cuban Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and others- has steadily increased to address ever more critical issues facing both countries .
 Science and global health diplomacy were key to reestablishing a trusting and productive relationship of mutual and global benefit after the USA and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in 2015 .
 Recent changes in Cuba policy by the new U.S. administration are jeopardizing opportunities for increased scientific cooperation, the authors say . The changes are in the best interests of people in both countries .
 All four solar radiometers retrieve CWV by measuring total solar transmittance in the 0.94-gm water vapor absorption band and subtracting contributions due to Rayleigh, ozone and aerosol transmittances . CWV is retrieved by combining total solar transmittance with
 In a first round of comparison no attempt was made to standardize on the same radiative transfer model and its underlying water vapor spectroscopy .
 In the second round of comparison, we used the same line-by-line code to retrieve CAN from all four suntracking radiometers . In the first round, the same code was used to retrieve the same CAN from each of the radiometers.
 The spread of 8% in solar radiometer results found when using the same model is an indication of the other-than-model uncertainties involved in determining CWV from solar transmittance measurements .
 Study for determination of industrial water corrosivity in Kashan Fajre Sepahan Galvanizing Mills during 2005-2006 Iran . Study was carried out in Iran .
 Rabbani, D; Miranzadeh, M B; Motlagh, A Ahmadi 2008-01-01 . This research was carried out in Kashan Fajre Sepahan Galvanizing mills .
 This research showed that in raw water LI were positive as well as RI and PI were lower than 7 which means that mentioned water is not corrosive . In raw water, LI and RI were positive .
 LI in treated water by reverse osmosis process was negative . RI and PI were higher than 7, so, this water has corrosive properties . LI in . treated water was negative and RI was higher than . 7 .
 According to LI, conditioned water is not corrosive but based on RI and P this water tend to corrosivity . This findings are compatible with literature review statement. Finally, calculated indexes indicate that according to LI .
 It is recommended that for water conditioning addition of preservative chemicals to be continued but at the same time another alternatives such as pH adjustment, air stripping and air stripping should be studied .
 The Verde Valley is a portion of central Arizona where concerns have been raised about water availability, particularly perennial base flow of the Verde River . Concerns have also been raised over water availability .
 The Northern Arizona Regional Groundwater Flow Model was used to generate the water budgets . The model was run in several configurations for the 1910–2005 and 2005–2110 time periods .
 The resultant water budgets subtracted from one another in order to quantify relative changes attributed solely to human stresses . Human stresses included groundwater withdrawals and incidental and artificial recharge but did not include, for example, human effects on the global climate .
 Three hypothetical and varied conditions of human stresses were developed and applied to the model for the 2005–2110 period . The model is based on the hypothetical conditions of life in a hypothetical period .
 Human stresses during 1910–2005 were found to have already affected the hydrologic system of the Verde Valley . Human stresses will continue to affect the hydrolic system during 2005–2110 .
 Riparian evapotranspiration decreased and underflow into the Verde Valley increased because of human stresses . Net groundwater discharge decreased for the 1910–2005 model runs . Underflow increased due to human stresses, according to the study .
 Base flow at the upstream end of the study area, as of 2005, was about 4,900 acre-feet per year less than it would have been in the absence of human stresses . The model also showed that base flow in the upstream area was about . less than . it would
 Base flow had been reduced by about 10,000 acre-feet per year by the year 2005 . At the downstream end of the Verde Valley, base flow has been reduced . Base flow has also been reduced because of human stresses, officials say .
 The Lower Floridan aquifer in west-central Florida generally contains highly mineralized water . The middle confining unit and the Lower Florid aquifer generally contain highly mineralised water .

 Two-structure thermodynamics for the TIP4P/2005 model of water covering supercooled and deeply stretched regions .
 Biddle, John W; Singh, Rakesh S; Sparano, Evan M; Ricci, Francesco Ricci; González, Miguel A; Valeriani, Chantal; Abascal, José L F; Debenedetti, Pablo G;
 If the non-ideality in the Gibbs energy of mixing overcomes the ideal entropy of mixing of these two structures, a liquid-liquid phase transition is predicted . A liquid-Liquid phase transition, terminated at a liquid critical point, is predicted to occur .
 Various versions of the ""two-structure equation of state"" based on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data for metastable, deeply supercooled water .
 TSEOSs were not designed to describe the negative pressure region and do not account for the stability limit of the liquid state with respect to the vapor . However, existing TSEOs do not allow the instability limit of a liquid state .
 experimental data on supercooled water at negative pressures may shed additional light on the source of the anomalies of water . Such data are very limited .
 TIP4P/2005 is one of the most accurate classical water models available . The model is based on a simulation of the water from the model of the World's largest lake .
 We have used recently published simulation data, and performed additional simulations, over a broad range of positive and negative pressures . From ambient temperature to deeply supercooled conditions, we have simulated the effects of supercooling .
 We show that, by incorporating the liquid-vapor spinodal into a TSEOS, we are able to match the simulation data for TIP4P/2005 with remarkable accuracy .
 This equation of state quantitatively reproduces the lines of extrema in density, compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity . In particular, this equation of . state quantifies the lines in density and compressibility .
 The liquid-vapor spinodal in the present TSEOS continues monotonically to lower pressures upon cooling, influencing but not giving rise to density extrema and other thermodynamic anomalies .
 The results of this assessment were used to determine the current water-quality conditions in this subregion of the High Plains aquifer . The results were used .
 Water samples rarely exceeded established U.S. Environmental Protection Agency public drinking-water standards for those constituents sampled . 13 of the constituents measured or analyzed exceeded their respective standards in at least one sample .
 Nitrate, uranium, iron, and manganese concentrations were larger than drinking-water standards in 6 percent of the samples . Nitrate and uranium was larger than water standards in six percent of those samples .
 Wells sampled in the Platte River Valley and Eastern Nebraska units exceeded water-quality standards more often than the Ogallala Formation and Sand Hills units . Wells sampled exceeded water quality standards in those units .
 System state variables include distribution of heads within an aquifer, streamflow rates within a hydraulically connected stream, and flow rates into or out of aquifer storage . These system state variables can be used to determine the distribution of water heads within the aquifer .
 The new package provides a means to explicitly represent heads, streamflows, and changes in aquifer storage as state variables in a GWM-2005 simulation .
 The availability of these state variables makes it possible to include system state in the objective function . It also enhances existing capabilities for constructing constraint sets for groundwater-management formulation .
 The new package can be used to address groundwater-management problems such as withdrawal strategies that meet water-supply demands while simultaneously maximizing heads or streamflows .
 Four sample problems are provided to demonstrate use of the new package for typical groundwater-management applications . The package is designed to provide groundwater management for typical applications .
 Assessing bottled water nitrate concentrations to evaluate total drinking water nitration exposure and risk of birth defects . Assessing the amount of nitrate in bottled water to evaluate the risk of drinking water .
 Previous epidemiologic studies of maternal exposure to drinking water nitrate did not account for bottled water consumption . Previous studies did not find that mothers drank water with nitrate .
 The objective of this National Birth Defects Prevention Study was to assess the impact of bottled water use on the relation between drinking water nitrate and selected birth defects in infants born during 1997-2005 .
 Mothers' overall intake of nitrate in mg/day from drinking water was calculated . Median bottled water nitrate concentrations were assigned by community . Mothers' nitrate intake was calculated at a rate of 1mg/day for each mother .
 Odds ratios for neural tube defects, limb deficiencies, oral cleft defects, and heart defects were estimated using mixed-effects models for logistic regression .
 This article traces the battle over Freud within Cuban psychiatry from its pre-1959 origins through the ""disappearance"" of Freud by the early 1970s . Lambe, Jennifer Lynn 2017-01-01 .
 Two Soviet psychiatrists visited Cuba in the early 1960s as part of a campaign to promote Pavlov . It devotes particular attention to the visit of two Soviet psychiatrists to Cuba .
 The decade-long controversy over Freud responded to both theoretical and political concerns . Freud's theories have been debated for more than a decade .
 Pavlov held out the promise of a dialectical materialist future . If for some Freud represented political conservatism and theoretical mystification, Pavlov was a conservative . Pavlov's work was published in 1925 .
 Other psychiatrists clung to psychodynamic perspectives, or at least the possibility of heterogeneity .
 The Freudians would end up on the losing side of this battle, with many departing Cuba over the course of the 1960s . Many of the Freudians left Cuba in the wake of the conflict .
 Banishing Freud did not necessarily make for stalwart Pavlovians-or vanguard revolutionaries . But banishing Freud didn't necessarily mean that they were revolutionaries .
 Psychiatry would find itself relegated to a handmaiden position in the work of revolutionary mental engineering, with the government itself occupying the vanguard .
 The lake is the primary drinking-water supply for the City of Shreveport, Louisiana . It is also the primary source of water for the city's water supply .
 The land use of the watershed contributing runoff to Cross Lake has changed . In addition, the land use in the watershed has changed. In addition to the change in land use, there has also been a change in water use .
 Changes in land use and urbanization could affect the water chemistry and biology of the Lake . Changes in the lake's water chemistry could affect its biology .
 Water-quality data were collected at 10 sites on Cross Lake from February 1997 to February 1999 . Water quality data was collected from 10 sites across the lake .
 These samples included physical and chemical-related properties such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance . These samples include selected major inorganic ions; nutrients; minor elements; organic chemical constituents; and bacteria .
 Suspended-sediment samples were collected seven times during the sampling period . Suspended sediments were collected at least seven times .

 Evidence suggests that human toxocariasis could stimulate the onset of allergic diseases such as asthma . Evidence suggests the disease could stimulate onset of asthma .
 In subjects having a hypothetical 'atopic genotype', HT could boost preexistent allergy symptoms . More specifically, in subjects having an atopicgenotype, HT boosts preexisting symptoms .
 We tested the latter hypothesis in Cuba, where both asthma and HT are prevalent, in a country where both are prevalent .
 In a group of Cuban school-aged children, we investigated the association of Toxocara seropositivity and atopic status with asthma . The study was published in the journal Astrophysics, Astrophication and Astrophilia .
 Toxocara seropositivity was diagnosed with ELISA and atopy by allergen skin prick test . The atopy was diagnosed by ELISA with allergenic skin prick tests .
 Both physician-diagnosed asthma and current wheeze, as determined by International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire were considered .
 Associations were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses, with either 'physician-diagnosed asthma' or 'current wheeze' as outcome variable .
 Prevalences were 21.7% for current wheeze and 32.7 for physician-diagnosed asthma . Prevalence of current wheezezes was 21.3% and 21.5% for physician diagnosed asthma .
 Our data confirm previous observations of higher Toxocara seropositivity rates in asthmatic children . Our data confirms previous observations .
 Toxocara seropositivity appeared to abrogate the association between atopy and asthma in Cuban children . The link between asthma and atopy was found to be down to atopy in children .
 This observation challenges the hypothesis that HT stimulates the onset of allergic diseases such as asthma in atopic individuals . Although this observation was limited to physician-diagnosed asthma, it challenged the hypothesis . HT is thought to stimulate onset of allergy diseases such an atopic individual .
 Existing research rarely considers important ethnic subgroup variations in violent behaviors among Latino youth, authors say .
 The risk for severe violent behavior is not well understood in light of the immense ethnic and generational diversity of the Latino population in the U.S. Latino population .
 Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban and non-Latino Black and White adolescents with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health . We examine differences in the risk for severe youth violence, as well its associations with family cohesion, parental engagement, adolescent autonomy .
 Puerto Rican youth had the highest risk compared to all other racial/ethnic subgroups . Results indicate a gradient of risk; White youth had lowest risk for severe violence .
 Within-group analysis indicates that family factors are not universally protective or risk-inducing . Family factors are also not universally beneficial to those at risk, study finds .
 While family cohesion decreased the risk of severe violence among all groups, parental engagement was associated with increased risk among Blacks and Whites . Adolescent autonomy was also found to be linked to increased risk in Puerto Ricans and Cubans .
 Cuban and White adolescents who lived in single parent households or who did not live with their parents, had higher risk for severe violent behaviors . Adolescent children who live in single-parent households have higher risk of violent behavior than those who live with parents .
 Among Latinos, the association of immigrant generation was in opposite directions among Mexicans and Cubans . The association between immigrant generation and immigrant generation is in opposite direction among Mexicans .
 Family and immigration factors differentially influence risk for violence among Latino subgroups . The study concludes that family, immigration factors influence the risk of violence among Latinos .

 Plain water consumption in relation to energy intake and diet quality among U.S. adults, 2005-2012 . Volatile organic compounds found to be volatile organic compounds .
 The present study examined plain water consumption in relation to energy intake and diet quality among United States adults .
 First-difference estimator approach addressed confounding bias by using within-individual variations in diet and plain water consumption between two nonconsecutive 24-h dietary recalls .
 Daily overall diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2010 was not found to be associated with the proportion of daily plain water in total dietary water consumption . The index-2010 is based on the healthy eating index .
 Promoting plain water intake could be a useful public health strategy for reducing energy and targeted nutrient consumption in U.S. adults .
 The amended rules require users of wells that divert tributary ground water to annually report the water pumped monthly by each well . Users must also report how much water they pump monthly .
 State of Kansas says PCC approach does not provide same accuracy and reliability as a TFM when used to determine pumpage . Opinions presented before the Special Master hearing a court case concerning post-Compact well pumping were presented .
 In 1997, the United States Geological Survey began a 2-year study to compare ground-water pumpage estimates made using the TFM and the PCC approaches .
