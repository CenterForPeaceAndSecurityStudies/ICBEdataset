 A considerable number of such books had already been written, such as Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe, to the not-so-informative or humorous .
 These questions are of interest to us all, or to all of us reading this particular book . These questions should be answered by the author .
 The twentieth century saw scientific fields becoming so complex that only a small number of specialists are able to master their techniques and the mathematics used to describe them . Only a small handful of specialists can master the scientific fields .
 Few people have the time and inclination to write amusing books describing the highlights of their own field . And very few of these people have time to write books about the highlights, not only of their field .
 In reading this book you will probably encounter some terms with which you are unfamiliar . In this book, you will likely encounter some . terms with . which you may be unfamiliar with . The author of this book is a former journalist .
 You will not be tested on these terms, but should wish to review them, feel free to use the extensive glossary at the end of the book .
 Each of the fifty-three chapters in this book represents a significant event in the history of the universe . The book is written in New York City .
 The first page of each chapter lets you know where and when the event occurred . The first pages of each book cover the events leading up to the end of each event .
 Time points early in the history of the universe give the time elapsed since the Big Bang . These are usually written in scientific notation . Time points are often used to give the date of the Big Big Bang and explain how the universe formed .
 You can look at the glossary entry on “scientific notation” for more information on how to interpret these numbers .
 I hope that you enjoy it, that you learn from it, and that you recommend it to friends, relatives, coworkers, acquaintances, bartenders, bus drivers, flight attendants, random passers-by, and pretty much anyone else you meet .
 In which our universe began, there was a universe very much like our own . The Big Bang happened long ago and far away .
 It had dogs, and cats, and people, and Trigoencephalopodic Gnoccis, and other things of which you've never heard because we haven't encountered them yet . It had people (some of whom preferred the dogs) and some of whom prefer the cats .
 One of the effects of quantum mechanics was that large amounts of matter and energy could spontaneously appear, even though this rarely happened in a given volume of space . Now it just so happened that one of the effect of quantum mechanics was that large amounts of matter
 Once upon a once-upon-a-time, an entire universe appeared . Well, on this particular once, it was a universe .
 Its density was more than 1000 billion billion billion times the density of water . Its temperature was over 100,000 billion billion degrees Fahrenheit . It was also more than three billion times that of water.
 The new universe quickly became detached from the old universe and started expanding into a completely different four-dimensional volume of space . Luckily for the inhabitants of the first universe, the new universe didn't have to wait for them .
 This is the story of that Universe, and of some of the things that have happened in it during the last 14 billion years . 10“^^ seconds after the Big Bang The Universe QUANTUM FLUCTUATION .
 We're ready for the start of what should be a most exciting Cosmological Derby . Click here for more Manchester United news .
 There are just four forces competing today, but each and every one of them is a champion in its own right . There are four forces in the world today, and each is a world champion .
 All four forces are lined up and unified at the starting gate, waiting for the bell to announce the moment of the Big Bang . The race will begin to determine which is the strongest force in the Universe .
 The Universe is expanding, but for some reason it never gets any easier to find a parking place . While the fundamental particle physicists frown at the lack of precision in this explanation, the rest of us may continue .
 You would have to wait 65 million years for a one-mile block in the middle of a parking space to expand enough to produce another parking space . The city's parking area is one of the largest in the world .
 The other reason is that the gravitational attraction between all of the particles in the Earth completely overcomes the expansion of the Universe . Even if you circled a block on Earth for 65 million years it wouldn't get bigger .
 Taking public transportation would be a much more efficient use of your time . Taking public transport is a better way to spend your time than taking the bus .
 In order to answer that question, let us imagine ourselves to be twodimensional creatures living on the surface of a balloon . We imagine ourselves as twoddimensional creatures .
 Only mathematicians among us have any concept of up/down, and everyone else suspects that they are probably just making it up . Only the mathematicians are likely to have any idea of up or down .
 Some two-dimensional astronomers discover 7 that the balloon is expanding . Eventually however, some astronomers discover that the balloons are expanding . The balloon balloon is believed to be expanding .
 Balloonland is a two-dimensional world of balloonland . The concept is difficult to explain to balloonland's inhabitants .
 Astronomers call this type of universe ‘closed’-and will eventually stop expanding and begin to recollapse . But that would imply the Universe has a finite volume .
 While this is possible, many astronomers now consider it unlikely . Astronomers now believe it is unlikely to happen again .
 It appears most likely that the Universe is infinite in extent-“open”-and will continue to expand forever . This implies that it is a three-dimensional hyperbolic paraboloid in four-dimensional space .
 Think of it as the fourdimensional representation of a three-dimensional saddle . Think of the saddle as a four-dimensional representation . The saddle is a representation of the world's most famous saddle .
 Antiparticles are very much like particles, except that when particles and antiparticles meet they completely destroy each other and emit a burst of energetic radiation . When particles and antiparticles meet, they emit an energetic radiation that can be seen in space .
 God separated photons from particles and antiparticles . God saw that the light was good, and separated the particles from the particles .
 God called the photons “bosons” and the particles and antiparticles He called “fermions” The photons were created in the first 10'""^^ seconds of creation . And there was pair production and there was photon creation .
 God made an exponential expansion of the Universe that separated the magnetic monopoles from each other so that all attempts to find one would be futile . So God made it so that no attempt was made to find a monopole was futile .
 And there was vacuum energy density and there was 'j-y inflation-the first 10' seconds . And there were vacuum energy densities and there were 'j'y inflation'
 God made protons and neutrons combine to produce deuterium nuclei . He combined to make helium nuclei, and he combined to create the helium nucleus . God made the nuclei from protons, neutrons and protons together .
 There was also some lithium and there was also beryllium-the first three minutes. And there were also lithium and also some baryllium .
 God blessed the partieles and said, “Be fruitful and produee neutral atoms,” and the radiation beeame less energetie and the eleetrons eombined with atomie nuelei .
 There was baekground radiation and there were neutral atoms- the first 380,000 years . And there was . baek ground radiation and . neutral atoms . There was . a . neutral atom-freezing radiation . And then there was neutral atoms in neutral atoms for the first time

 The Local Group is a collection of about two dozen galaxies located on the outskirts of the large Virgo Cluster of Galaxies . Another major galaxy formed today in the Local Group, 10 billion years ago .
 Whether life will develop within either of these galaxies is still an open question . Life is still a mystery in both galaxies .
 Globular clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars . They orbit the new galaxy along elliptical paths . The galaxy was formed by a galaxy that formed in the early 2000s .
 The stars here are mostly hydrogen and helium so it is not expected that many planets will form . It is unlikely for life to arise around these stars .
 As the pregalactic cloud began to collapse in earnest, the cloud's slight rotation became faster and faster . The stars and gas formed a disk, forming a disk .
 The intense star formation in this region of the new galaxy will result in large amounts of the elements needed to form planets and life . It is expected to result in the formation of planets and planets .
 The chances for life may be highest near the center of the galaxy, where the star formation is most intense . Life may be most likely to occur near the galaxy's center .
 It is possible that supernova explosions will sterilize planets that orbit stars close to the center of the galaxy . Supernova explosions could sterilize stars that orbit close to center of galaxy .
 The Galaxy TURBULENT FRAGMENTATION . In which a Giant Cloud of Gas Fragments into Smaller Clouds, Which Become Protostars a stellar nursery .
 This month’s issue of Martha Stellar Living is devoted to learning how to make a star . Learn how to become a star in the new issue of this month's issue .
 I love stars because they provide an opportunity to be so wonderfully creative with such simple ingredients . I love them because of the chance to be creative with simple ingredients such as stars, I said .
 That cloud of gas you probably have in your garden could be turned into an old standby such as a Sun-like yellow star . It could be used to create a sun-like star or a cloud of dust .
 The 17 supergiant is a brilliant blue 17 super-giant . And simply by adding a bit of mass you can easily produce a superb blue super-giant .
 Of course, a well-stocked pantry makes the preparation of stars much, much simpler . A well-prepared pantry is a good way to prepare stars .
 Magnetic fields are most important and a good garden is an absolute must for providing the necessary elements . Magnetic fields most important is most important to Magnetic Fields .
 My garden is modest, only a few cubic parsecs in size, but it provides me with all the hydrogen, helium, and trace elements necessary to make perfect stars every time .
 To start, take a cloud with about ten thousand solar masses of material . Take a cloud of about 10,000 solar masses, say scientists .
 The cloud will be rotating, which is a problem because of course angular momentum is conserved . The cloud is rotating, meaning angular momentum will be conserved, says NASA .
 This is often very troubling to novices since traditional methods won't help here . Remember flexibility is an important part of being a good and creative cook . Flexibility is important for a good cook .
 Magnetic field transfers angular momentum from the entire cloud to the surrounding medium . So instead of dealing with each part of the cloud individually, add a magnetic field .
 Don't rush this step-you need to wait a full million or even ten million years before proceeding if you want a perfect star . Don't wait for a million or more million years to proceed .
 Your cloud should now be relatively smooth, with just a few lumps here and there . It should now look like a normal cloud with no problems .
 At this point, add some random motion to the mixture, and watch as this turbulence fragments it into smaller and smaller pieces . Watch as turbulence fragments the mixture .
 The Galaxy MASSIVE Star Formation In Which a Massive Star Is Formed stars in the making . In the last article I showed you how to turn a massive cloud into a star .
 As long as you keep it transparent the radiation will escape from the center and the temperature will be stable . The temperature will also be stable in the room .
 Remember that you can't get a perfect star if it is heated unevenly during formation, so never skimp on these details . Remember that it can't be a star if you heat unevenly .
 After a few thousand years, the central regions should become dense and begin to collapse faster than the rest of the world . The central regions are expected to collapse rapidly after a few thousands of years .
 The density and pressure should increase 20 until the central regions reach a temperature of about 3,140 degrees Fahrenheit . At that point the hydrogen molecules begin to break into hydrogen atoms, spurring further collapse . The core is expected to reach 53,540 degrees Fahrenheit at the core of the core
 This increase in core temperature should occur over a period of a few hundred thousand years-remember not to rush things-and the surface temperature will increase from -270 degrees Fahrenheit to 4,940 degrees Fahrenheit .
 At this point the time required for the next step depends greatly on the final mass you want the star to have . The time required to complete the task depends on how much of the star's mass is needed .
 I usually make a massive star of about 15 solar masses . Because I insist on offering only the very best to my guests, I often make a star of around 15 .
 "Since such stars don't take as long to make, I can create more of them," he says . And since such a star can be created, he can make more, he says. "I can create a star of my own," he adds .
 While a star the mass of the Sun would take 40 million years to complete the protostar phase, a 15 solar mass star needs only 60,000 years . A 15 solar-mass star needs just 60,00 years for a star to complete that phase .
 The more massive star will live for only 10 million years rather than 10 billion, but that can be an advantage since I like to redecorate fairly frequently . Of course, the more . massive star . will live only for about 10 billion years .
 Less massive stars are cool, so I sometimes make a number of 21 low-mass stars just for a little variety in color . Still, since less massive stars, they're cool, they are red, so sometimes they're red .
 Star clusters can be elaborate, elegant, and substantial at the same time . Remember, the star clusters you create can be elegant and substantial .
 Don't forget that the final mass of each star will depend somewhat on the environment of the proto star . Be sure to prepare the region ahead of time so there will be no errors .
 In the final stages, the core temperature increases to a few hundred thousand degrees Fahrenheit, the hydrogen is ionized, and then the star contracts to its final radius .
 Once the core temperature is high enough , nuclear fusion commences, and a new star is born . The core temperature of a star's core can be high enough to make it a star .
 Remember that throughout this process, organization is of utmost importance . Remember that during this process of organization is the utmost importance. Remember that .
 Make sure that your ingredients are ready when they are needed . Know when and where to add more material is absolutely essential for making a star .
 For example, if the star rotates too quickly, it could end up with an active surface . It will not make for a lovely presentation .
 I KNOW that before you signed up to be a massive star YOU READ the FANCY BROCHURES that TALKED about how BRIGHTLY YOU'D BE SHINING AND HOW YOU'd BE VISIBLE FROM HALFWAY ACROSS THE Galaxy . I
 All three were busy fusing hydrogen to helium, but because their masses were not the same, they each went about it in a different way . All three fused hydrogen and helium in the same way .
 The little star shone only as brightly as it thought wise, and used up its hydrogen fuel very slowly .
 The medium star used up its hydrogen in 10 billion years and then started fusing helium to carbon and oxygen . It then fused helium and carbon to carbon, oxygen and carbon . It is the first star to use helium to fuse helium and oxygen in a star .
 The medium star decided to be content with being a slowly cooling white dwarf . But the helium only lasted a billion years, after which it decided to become a white star .
 Even though it had 25 times more hydrogen than the medium star, it used it up 1,400 times faster . The hydrogen only lasted 7 million years, and it only lasted seven million years . The medium star used it more than 25 times the more hydrogen .
 The big star started fusing helium to carbon, but that only lasted half a million years . Then the big star fused helium and carbon to carbon . Then it fused carbon to helium, but it only lasted a half million years.
 It was left with a core of one and a half solar masses of iron at a temperature of 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit . The core of the iron core is left at 10 billion degree Fahrenheit .
 The protons and neutrons in iron nuclei are so tightly bound together that iron fusion doesn't produce energy . And unfortunately for the big star, that doesn't happen .
 The temperature rose even more until energetic photons completely disintegrated the iron nuclei . Now the big star felt as though 7 billion billion billion elephants were pressing down on its core .
 The big star thought that 7 million years was a long time and that it didn't have to worry about such a distant future . He thought that the big star had no time to worry .
 After the hydrogen was gone, it realized that such wasteful energy production may not have been the wisest course of action, but it was too late to do anything about it . The government realized it may have been too late for it to take action .

 According to my neutrino detector, silicon burning should be almost complete . Neutrino-burning should be complete, according to the detector .
 Individual neutrinos very rarely interact with matter, but they can easily fry you . Even though individual neutrino very rarely interacts with matter they could easily fry someone .
 The material has rebounded and is flying away from the center of the star . The material is flying from the star's center .
 I am safely away from the supernova and am now able to report on the effects it is having on the surrounding area . The supernova is now a supernova supernova that has left a huge hole in Earth .
 Nearby clouds of hydrogen and helium gas are being compressed by the force of the explosion . Heavy elements are being mixed with the clouds, and the heavy elements it created are mixed .
 Some of these clouds are now dense enough to become protostars . But the amount of metals is probably too small to create planets .
 "We didn't have a lot of resources to spend. We wanted a star with a big enough habitable zone that we could have life on at least one planet," she says .
 The stars would be emitting only 30 to 60 percent of the energy that a one solar mass star emits . The stars emit only 30-60 percent of that amount of energy .
 There were nine planets forming around it, one of which was at a distance of 93 million miles from the star . It was exactly 1.2 million solar masses and there were 9 planets formed around it .
 Stars produce more energy with time, so the location of the habitable zone changes . This planet would be habitable for at least six billion years, by which time we will have long since retired .
 Scientists found only 1 part per 10 billion of lead and no detectable radon in the star . No radon was detected, which set our minds at ease .
 After getting a loan for the necessary resources, we signed the final papers and the star system was ours . After getting the necessary funds, we got the necessary funding for the project . We hope to see the first of its kind in a new galaxy .
 The Planets Show is back on the Galactic Value Channel . It is the latest episode of the Planet Earth Show . It will be on the show at 8pm ET .
 It's the number one best-selling planetary type in our GVC collection . It's a terrestrial planet, which as you know is the number-one best-seller planetary type .
 The Earth and the other terrestrial planets are forming close to the sun out of kilometer-sized chunks of rock . The Earth is forming out of kilometers of rock close to its own sun .
 Temperature in inner solar system is too high for ice to survive . Outer planets have only about 10 percent of the planetesimals available to the outer planets . The outer planets will not become massive enough to hold onto hydrogen and helium .
 It will be a beautiful mixture of brown and blue, with about 70 percent of its surface covered by water . It will also be a mixture of water and brown .
 "I heard the writing on the wall and just knew it would go fast. You know, when I saw that it was on the schedule I heard that it would be on the . schedule," she says .

 The Earth MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION In Which Life on Earth Begins It was a dark and stormy night. The Earth was the beginning of life .
 In the shallow tide pool, a nucleic acid base collided with a sugar molecule . The nucleic acids collided with the sugar molecules in the water .
 The tide pool had once been connected to the sea, but since then an army of sluggish days had marched by . Evaporation had increased the concentration of organic molecules .
 Things had been tough for a long time, but now it's easier for small chains of molecules to form . Things had to be tough for the long-term but now they are easier now .
 A longer chain with a sinister look formed on the clay bottom, but then a speedy molecule slammed into it like brass knuckles on a Ming vase and disappeared into the night .
 The water, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide that composed the comet had been shock heated and converted into dozens of different organic molecules . In the upper atmosphere, the water, . methane, . nitrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide were converted into . organic molecules.
 The shock wave from the impact hit the pool, increasing the temperature of the water like a match in a bathtub still . The impact of the impact increased the water temperature to 39 .
 When the Sun rose in the morning, its bright ultraviolet light sped things up . The Sun was the fastest time in the history of solar activity .
 Many complex chains of molecules were formed in the newly enriched tide pool . The tide pool was enriched by the discovery of the new species .
 One of the new chains had the unique property that it could reproduce itself using the molecules in the tide pool as raw materials .
 The simple molecules of the tide pool began to feel like swimmers with concrete galoshes . It was the first time the simple molecules felt like swimming with concrete .
 It didn't take long before most of the bit players had been consumed and the tide pool was filled with copies of the chain .
 A high tide came in and washed many of the big boys out to sea, where they began to prey upon a new set of short, helpless chains of molecules .
 The long chains of molecules continued to reproduce themselves in a shallow bay near the tide pool by feasting upon the smaller chains in the area .
 Some of the long chains lost the ability to produce reproducing copies of themselves, but every so often a molecular chain formed that could reproduce itself even better than the rest of the molecular chain .
 The process led from complex chains of molecules to even more complicated groups of molecules . The process was led by a group of molecules that had to be made into complex groups .

 The Earth is composed of multicellular organisms . Organisms are composed of many specialized cells . The essential feature of these disorders is the alteration of cells to become mutually dependent upon one another .
 If it occurs with identical cells (as in Colonial Organism Disorder), then the cells become temporarily or permanently associated but little integration of cellular activities occurs . If it happens with identical cell cells, it is possible to have an identical cell with no effect .
 A state of being is defined here as an enduring pattern of existence wherein the individual cells combine to participate in food consumption or production, reproduction, and locomotion as a single entity .
 In classic cases, the collection of cells is permanently associated as a colonial organism . In other cases, transient collections of cells can form a temporary aggregation .
 The existence of only one distinct state of being within a group of identical cellular organisms is a diagnostic criterion for 314.15 Colonial Organism Disorder . A .
 In classic cases (Complex Multicellular Organism Disorder), a large amount of cellular specialization occurs . Different types of cells are responsible for locomotion, reproduction, and other cellular functions .

 The improved lungs extract oxygen from air in addition to the oxygen we obtain from the water with gills . They have since been used extensively in shallow stagnant ponds and bays where the oxygen content in the water is too low for gills to function properly .
 The feet have been very useful in traversing the bottom of swampy regions on the edges of continents . The feet were used in the search for African elephants in the past .
 Such locomotion does not alert prey to our presence in the way that swimming does, and therefore has dramatically increased our ability to obtain food . It has therefore increased our . ability to . obtain food, such as swimming, has increased our chances of catching prey .
 On land the downward gravitational force will not be balanced by an upward buoyancy force . For example, because air is much less dense than water, on land the gravitational force is not equal to that of water .
 We will need compact and muscular bodies to overcome the force of gravity . We will therefore need compact bodies to overcome the forces of gravity.
 For complete COL we will also need to be able to reproduce out of the water . We need to also have to have the ability to reproduce from water .
 This will require eggs that will hold water while being permeable to the oxygen that is so important to developing embryos . The eggs will need to be able to hold water, while being able to develop an embryo .
 Although this problem is difficult, it is not intractable, it will be the subject of a future TSF grant proposal if the current proposal is funded and successful . The current proposal would be funded by TSF .

 Convince one or more of the countries that have atomic weapons to detonate one where and when you like like . Convince a country that has a nuclear weapon to do so, detonate it where you like. Convince someone to do the same thing .
 This would probably be difficult to do, unless you happen to want a fission explosion on a small island in the Pacific, in a desert, or near a border between two countries who have recently announced that they have nuclear weapons . This would be difficult for a nuclear bomb to detonate
 One or more of the countries that have atomic weapons may be willing to part with a few for the right price . The U.S. could sell atomic weapons for a price .
 More than 99 percent of uranium is U-238, which isn't suitable for use as an active material in bombs . You could use uranium, but this is difficult to obtain . You can also use uranium .
 The weapons-grade device will reliably release kilotons of energy . The reactor-grade weapon will yield a less predictable yield of between ^Band kiloton and kiloton .
 You will probably have a much easier time obtaining reactor-grade plutonium . Despite this disadvantage, you will probably be able to obtain the reactor grade plutonium .
 Construct a spherical shell around this sphere withwedgeshaped grooves on the inside of the shel . Th e grooves should be covered thick layer of gold and of polonium .
 Make identical plutonium wedges and assemble them into a soccer ball shape around the spherical shell . Then make the shape of the soccer ball into a football ball shape .
 Put conventional explosives around the plutonium shell and a.cm thick shell of Uranium-238 around the explosives . Put conventional . explosives . around the explosive shell . Use conventional explosives .
 It would be good to have a lead shell around the whole thing to cut down on the radiation coming from the plutonium and uranium before the bomb is detonated . Finally, it would be a good idea to have the bomb shell around .
 When a plutonium atom absorbs a neutron it splits into two smaller atoms (for example, strontium and barium) This releases energy and several more neutrons, which can be released .
 These neutrons each go on to split other plutonium atoms, which emit more energy and neutrons . The neutrons are then used to split plutonium atoms to create plutonium atoms .
 Uranium-238 is a very good reflector of neutrons . Any neutrons that escape from the plutonium sphere will be bounced back by the uranium shell .
 The chain reaction continues until betweenH% and of the plutonium atoms have been split, at which point so much energy has been released that the bomb (and much of the surrounding countryside) is vaporized .
 The surgeon general has determined that fission explosions may be hazardous to your health . Fission explosions have been deemed hazardous to the public .

 At Volk Field in Wisconsin, the klaxon signaling a nuclear war went off by mistake . The kulaxon was meant to be a warning of nuclear war .
 The pilots immediately started their nuclear-armed interceptors and were moving down the runway when an officer drove his vehicle in front of them and ordered them to stop . The pilot and the pilot were flying on the runway at the time .
 The base commander had phoned Duluth and found out that it was the sabotage alarm that should have sounded, not the nuclear war klaxon . The sabotage alarm had been called by the base commander .
 This was a previously scheduled test, but no one had thought to cancel it, despite the fact that the other nine test missiles had been loaded with nuclear weapons during the previous two days . This was the first scheduled test to be cancelled, but it was not cancelled .
 The pilot radioed for help and nuclear-armed Air Force F-105 jets were scrambled to escort the pilot back . Nuclear-armed air force jets escorted the pilot from the scene .
 The Soviets launched interceptors to shoot down the U-2, but it returned to U.S. airspace before they could reach it . The U.2 returned to American airspace before it could be shot down .
 Had the U-2 been attacked, it would have been within the local Air Force base commander's authority to order the FI05s to use nuclear missiles .
 The interceptor pilots had the ability, and in the case of a communications failure, to attack hostile Soviet aircraft by using their nucleartipped missiles .
 At the same time, a satellite came over the horizon at just the wrong moment, resulting in a real radar detection despite the fictional missile . The satellite came in the wrong way at the wrong time, leading to radar detection .
