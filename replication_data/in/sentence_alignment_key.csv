455,33,33,"This confirmed the fears expressed by many analysts, as well as Chadian and Sudanese opposition movements, that the agreement would not be signed in good faith and would have little effect on the overall conflict.",,,
455,34,34,"In early May, JEM rebels advanced on Khartoum.",,,
455,35,35,"On May 10, heavy fighting occurred and the government repelled the assault.",,,
455,36,36,"The following day, Sudan cut diplomatic ties with Chad in response.",,,
455,37,37,"On May 12, Chad countered by closing its border with Sudan and cutting economic and cultural ties.",,,
455,38,38,"Despite this attempt on its capital, Sudan mainly perceived a limited military threat from Chad and JEM rebels.",,,
455,39,39,"Despite warnings by France, Chadian rebels began a military offensive in early June 2008 and threatened to shoot down any French reconnaissance aircraft.",,,
455,40,40,"On June 18, Chadian forces defeated the offensive.",,,

455,42,42,Chad accused EUFOR of siding with the rebels.,,,
455,43,43,"This marked the second time during the crisis that the EUFOR mission came under fire, as a EUFOR peacekeeper was killed on March 3 by the Sudanese army after accidentally crossing into Sudan.",,,
455,44,44,"The ""contact group"" charged with implementing the Dakar Agreement met numerous times throughout this series of clashes in the spring and into the summer.",,,
455,45,45,"The contact group consisted of several African states -- Libya, Congo Brazzaville, Senegal, Gabon, and Eritrea -- as well as a group of high-profile international actors that were viewed as ""guarantors"" of the agreement -- UN, EU, AU, OIC, the Community of the Sahel and Saharan States (CEN-SAD, aka COMESSA), France, UK, and US.",,,
455,46,46,"The first meeting of the contact group was held on April 10, and subsequent meetings were held on April 28, June 9, June 24, and July 17.",,,
455,47,47,"A broad range of issues were discussed at the April and June meetings, but Chad and Sudan were only able to agree on the composition and logistics of a joint observer mission to be deployed in the border region between the two countries.",,,
455,48,48,"Nevertheless, while working in conjunction with each other, several mediators in the contact group also met individually with one or both sides at various points during the remainder of the crisis and/or issued statements condemning offensives launched by Sudanese and Chadian rebels.",,,
455,49,49,"While implementation of the Dakar Agreement was a key concern, of prime importance to the mediators in the wake of JEM's early May offensive was to get Chad and Sudan to restore diplomatic relations with one another.",,,
455,50,50,"At the July 17 meeting of the contact group, Senegal convinced Sudan to agree to restore diplomatic relations with Chad by arguing that the Dakar Agreement could not be implemented if official ties between the two countries were severed.",,,
455,51,51,,"Chad called this move a step in the right direction, but said that it required a stronger commitment from Sudan to stop destabilizing Chad before it would agree to resume relations.",,
455,52,52,,"Following up on this effort by Senegal, Libya met with Chad and Sudan in late July and made proposals that were accepted by both sides, including the restoration and normalization of diplomatic relations and resumption of cooperation between the two countries, as well as the establishment of a tripartite summit to oversee their previous agreements that was to be sponsored by Libya and include the participation of Presidents Deby and al-Bashir.",,
455,53,53,,"After meeting with Libya on August 1, Sudanese President al-Bashir instructed the relevant domestic authorities to immediately restore relations with Chad and reopen the Sudanese embassy there.",,
455,54,54,,This terminated the crisis for both sides.,,
455,55,55,,"After previously criticizing what they viewed as the ineffectiveness of various members of the mediation team (particularly the guarantors of the Dakar Agreement), Sudan and Chad both expressed satisfaction with Libya's efforts that helped contribute -- along with a general stalemated situation -- to the conclusion of the crisis.",,
455,56,56,,"The contact group continued to meet after the crisis terminated, convening for the final time on 15 November 2008.",,
455,57,57,,Several subsequent attempts by the contact group to meet failed.,,
455,58,58,,"In addition to the large-group primary mediation effort, the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) Group also mediated between Chad and Sudan in late July 2008, sending an ambassadorial mission on a fact-finding mission to the region and talking with both sides in an attempt to find a lasting peaceful settlement.",,
455,59,59,,"The UN was heavily involved in the crisis, and in two distinct ways: the Secretary General's participation in the mediation effort as part of the contact group, and the Security Council's provision of emergency military assistance through the deployment of EUFOR and AU/UN forces (although both had been authorized before the crisis).",,
464,1,1,A crisis occurred from 22 February 2011 to 20 October 2011 between Libya and a coalition of international actors (mostly NATO members) that were opposed to the brutal repression by Muammar Gaddafis regime of anti-government protesters and rebel supporters during an emerging civil war.,,,
464,2,2,"The anti-Gaddafi coalition states that experienced a crisis included the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar.",,,

464,4,4,"In mid-January 2011, inspired in part by the civil uprising that occurred earlier in Tunisia, small protests began to emerge in Libya, focusing on issues such as corruption, local concerns, and a desire for greater political freedoms.",,,
464,5,5,These eventually gave way to mass demonstrations against the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli and Benghazi beginning in early February.,,,
464,6,6,"By mid-February, protests spread to the rest of the country and civilians began demanding that Gaddafi step down.",,,
464,7,7,The Gaddafi regime responded with a violent repression campaign against demonstrators.,,,
464,8,8,"Repression escalated significantly beginning on 16 February, and reports of mass killings occurred on 17 and 19 February.",,,
464,9,9,This attracted significant attention and condemnation from the international community.,,,
464,10,10,"On 16 February, Human Rights Watch called for intervention in Libya, particularly from the members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).",,,

464,15,15,"On 22 February 2011, the escalating protests and repression in Libya reached a tipping point.",,,
464,16,16,"Libya responded to mass protests against the regime that day with military force, including the use of helicopter gunships, artillery fire, and snipers.",,,
464,17,17,"On the same day, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi delivered a potent speech in which he threatened to show no mercy to protestors, urged his loyalists to attack protesters and their supporters, and vowed to never resign or leave Libya.",,,
464,18,18,"The culmination of escalating repression and Gaddafis speech triggered foreign policy crises for the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar.",,,
464,19,19,"The major responses from these states were multi-faceted, beginning with condemnations on 22-23 February, escalating quickly to more substantial political and/or economic pressure, and culminating in mid-March with the most important general response: UN authorization and implementation of a no-fly zone in order to protect Libyan civilians.",,,
464,20,20,"On 23 February, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the European Union to impose sanctions against Libya and suggested that the assets of the Gaddafi family should be frozen.",,,
464,21,21,"On 25 February, the US closed its embassy in Tripoli and imposed unilateral economic sanctions on Libya, including the freezing of billions in Libyan government assets.",,,

464,23,23,"On 26 February, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1970, which imposed sanctions on Libya and referred the situation to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.",,,

464,26,26,"On 3 March, the US threatened to impose military sanctions on Libya, including a no-fly zone, and Obama issued the first public statement in which he demanded that Gaddafi step down and leave Libya.",,,
464,27,27,Early condemnations and calls for action also came from the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on 22 February and the African Union (AU) one day later.,,,
464,28,28,"The Arab Leagues involvement was most important: on 12 March, it called on the UN to impose a no-fly zone over Libya.",,,
464,29,29,This helped to spur and legitimize an effort from the wider international community to do the same.,,,
464,30,30,"The AU called for a transition to a post-Gaddafi Libya, but advocated for a negotiated process.",,,
464,31,31,"On 17 March, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace in order to protect civilians.",,,
464,32,32,"The resolution was proposed by the UK, France, and Lebanon.",,,
464,33,33,"Voting to adopt this resolution constituted the most important part of the major responses to the crisis trigger from the UK, US, and France.",,,
464,34,34,The passing of the UNSC resolution triggered a crisis for Libya.,,,
464,35,35,"The Libyan foreign minister, Moussa Koussa, declared a ceasefire later that day, framing it as a response to the UN resolution.",,,
464,36,36,"However, Libyan artillery shelling on Misrata and Ajdabiya continued, and government soldiers continued approaching Benghazi.",,,
464,37,37,"On 19 March, Libya issued its major response in the form of a public statement from Gaddafi in which he harshly condemned the UNSC resolution and vowed to arm the Libyan people and fight to the end to protect them from colonial, crusader aggression.",,,
464,38,38,"That same day, Libyan government troops and tanks entered Benghazi, and artillery and mortars were fired into the city.",,,
464,39,39,Enforcement of the no-fly zone also began on 19 March.,,,
464,40,40,This constituted the most important part of Canadas and Italys major responses to the crisis trigger.,,,

464,42,42,"Qatari fighter jets joined the enforcement effort the following day, which constituted the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger.",,,
464,43,43,These operations were eventually merged into a single NATO operation named Operation Unified Protector.,,,
464,44,44,The establishment of the no-fly zone provided vital assistance to the Libyan opposition groups.,,,
464,45,45,"As the Libyan state was dealt heavy blows from both the domestic opposition and the foreign interveners, the international community began recognizing the National Transition Council (NTC) as the official representative of the Libyan people.",,,
464,46,46,"In June, Gaddafi offered to hold elections and promised to step aside if he lost, but this offer was rejected by the NTC.",,,

464,53,53,,"At the outset of the crisis, humanitarian concerns were paramount for the NATO members that perceived a crisis.",,
464,54,54,,"The situation in Libya constituted a threat to non-material, moral values, specifically human rights, and invoked the Responsibility to Protect norm.",,
464,55,55,,"Italy also had economic concerns, as it received 25% of its oil and 10% of its natural gas from Libya, and the two countries were heavily mutually invested in each other.",,
464,56,56,,"France also perceived a threat to influence, adopting a strong anti-regime stance in order to help recover its reputation after taking failed pro-regime stances in several prior Arab Spring uprisings (e.g., Tunisia, Egypt).",,
464,57,57,,A number of the European crisis actors also had concerns about the possible influx of refugees.,,

464,62,62,,The US also provided covert support for NATO and the Libyan rebels.,,
464,63,63,,Qatars combat deployment was the first by an Arab or Muslim-majority country and thus of critical regional and diplomatic significance.,,

466,13,13,The AUHIP tried to mediate the modalities of a referendum in Abyei but was unable to do so over disagreements about who counted as a registered voter in the region.,,,
466,14,14,"In the following several months, a low-level rebellion against Sudan (Khartoum) began in Abyei.",,,
466,15,15,These rebels were supported by South Sudan.,,,

466,19,19,"The most important part of Sudans major response occurred on 22 May, when it seized nearly the entirety of the Abyei region.",,,

466,39,39,The AU Peace and Security Council gave the two sides a deadline of 2 August 2012 to reach an agreement and threatened that it would adopt a final proposal on the Abyei dispute and refer the issue to the UN Security Council if a deal was not reached by then.,,,

466,44,44,Sudan was steadfast in its determination to not allow a final resolution of the status of Abyei to occur or to promise a referendum without first getting guarantees that nomadic groups that pass through the region would also be included in the referendum.,,,
466,45,45,"Recognizing that negotiations would likely fail if the focus remained on Abyei, the AUHIP shifted the discussions to peripheral issues such as oil and demilitarization of the two sides common borderissues on which they had reached agreement earlier in the crisis but had not followed through on implementation.",,,

466,49,49,"By helping to bring about the final agreement that terminated the crisis, the AUHIPs mediation effort had a minor positive effect on crisis abatement, particularly through its facilitative tactics of bringing the parties together to talk.",,,
466,50,50,"In addition to its role as a mediator, the AU adopted numerous resolutions demanding a cessation of hostilities during the crisis.",,,

469,9,9,"His son, Kim Jong-un, took over the North Korean Supreme Leader office shortly thereafter, on 24 December.",,,

469,17,17,"Japan was particularly concerned with the nuclear issue and the related potential for an accident, having endured the Fukushima Power Plant nuclear disaster almost two years prior and having its airspace and nearby international waters repeatedly targeted by North Korean missile tests in recent times.",,,
469,18,18,"Also on that day, the US was reportedly in close consultation with South Korea about security issues.",,,
469,19,19,"On 13 February, South Korea implemented the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger by staging large-scale joint military drills with the United States.",,,

469,21,21,US participation in these drills involved troops it had already stationed in South Korea.,,,
469,22,22,"The following day, South Korea conducted the remainder of its major response: it unveiled a new cruise missile which was capable of striking anywhere in North Korea, deployed destroyers and submarines off its eastern coast, and officially condemned the nuclear test via a parliamentary resolution and a statement from the defense minister.",,,
469,23,23,"Shortly after the crisis began, discussions about further UNSC sanctions against North Korea commenced.",,,

469,28,28,This triggered a crisis for North Korea.,,,
469,29,29,Voting to adopt these sanctions was the most important part of the American major response to the crisis trigger.,,,
469,30,30,"The day after the sanctions were ordered, North and South Korea exchanged the highest level of hostile warnings that they had in years.",,,
469,31,31,"On 11 March, North Korea verbally nullified the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement between itself and South Korea.",,,

469,40,40,This was notable because the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is a joint venture between North and South Korea and one of the only mechanisms via which the two countries have cooperated during the 2000s.,,,
469,41,41,"It also marked a turning point in the crisis, as the primary issue soon shifted from the nuclear test to economic concerns between the two Koreas related to the KIC and its operation.",,,
469,42,42,"The following day, North Korea warned that it was on the brink of war.",,,
469,43,43,"After this escalation, South Korea called for talks to defuse tensions on 11 April, but North Korea refused to participate.",,,
469,44,44,"On 25 April, South Korea proposed talks once more and threatened to take a grave measure with regard to the KIC if North Korea did not agree to hold talks.",,,
469,45,45,"The following day, North Korea rejected the proposal to hold talks again, and South Korea announced that it was pulling its remaining workers from the KIC.

469,50,50,"South Korea and North Korea eventually met on 7 July and came to an agreement on the principles of reopening the KIC. Negotiations continued, and on 28 July, South Korea pledged $7.3 million in humanitarian aid for North Korea and called for one last round of make-or-break talks.",,,
469,51,51,,North Korea continued to drag its feet in these negotiations.,,
469,52,52,,"On 7 August, the South Korean government began the process of reviewing insurance claims to South Korean businesses that lost revenue due to the closing of the KIC, which was seen as the first step toward officially closing the KIC. Within 90 minutes of South Korea announcing that it was conducting this review, North Korea declared that it was committed to reopening Kaesong and proposed another round of talks on the matter.",,
469,53,53,,"North Korea was hurting economically from the closure of the KIC, to a much greater degree than South Korea, as well as from UN sanctions.",,
469,54,54,,"Talks re-commenced soon thereafter and resulted in an agreement on the reopening of the KIC, signed by North and South Korea on 14 August.",,
469,55,55,,This marked an end to the heightened level of tensions and terminated the crisis for all parties.,,
469,56,56,,As part of this agreement North Korea agreed to allow foreign investors into the KIC and adhere to international business standards that included allowing Internet and mobile phone access for South Korean factory managers.,,
469,57,57,,The two sides also agreed to no more unilateral closures of the KIC and the setting up of a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies for losses incurred due to the closure of the KIC.,,
469,58,58,,The nuclear issue remained unresolved.,,
469,59,59,,"Nevertheless, South Korea, the US, and Japan were satisfied to have relations between the two Koreas return to the status quo.",,
469,60,60,,The UN was involved in the crisis through the Security Councils imposition of sanctions on North Korea.,,
469,61,61,,The sanctions initially escalated tensions between the actors but ultimately contributed somewhat to bringing North Korea to the table.,,
469,62,62,,"Russia was minimally involved in the crisis: it condemned North Korea while also warning South Korea, the US, and Japan to not get involved.",,
469,63,63,,"On 7 April 2013, Switzerland indicated that it had recently been in contact with North Korean authorities and made an offer to mediate.",,
469,64,64,,"However, mediation did not occur.",,
471,1,1,A crisis occurred between Russia and Ukraine from 22 February 2014 to 18 February 2015.,,,

471,3,3,"On 21 November 2013, Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych sparked a wave of anti-government unrest  commonly known as Euromaidan  when he rejected a trade and political association agreement with the EU in favor of forging closer ties to Russia.",,,
471,4,4,"Demonstrations in favor of closer European integration began in Kiev that evening and were initially peaceful, but they eventually spread to other parts of Ukraine and escalated into a series of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as demands for the resignation of Yanukovych.",,,
471,5,5,"Violence between protestors and police reached its peak in mid-February 2014, when both sides were firing at each other and the number of deaths increased significantly.",,,
471,6,6,"Alarmed by the escalating use of repression by the Ukrainian government, the United States imposed visa bans on twenty senior Ukrainian governmental officials on 19 February.",,,
471,7,7,The EU followed suit the next day with its own package of sanctions that included travel bans and asset freezes targeted at Ukrainian officials as well as a ban on the export of equipment that could be used for repression by the Ukrainian government.,,,

471,11,11,"The opposition took over the Ukrainian government, and Maidan protestors captured the presidential palace and took control of Kiev.",,,
471,12,12,The removal of Yanukovych on 22 February 2014 sparked a crisis for Russia.,,,
471,13,13,Russia feared that Ukraine would leave its sphere of influence and become a NATO ally.,,,
471,14,14,"Russia also expressed concerns about the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine, particularly in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Crimea, where pro-Moscow protesters were calling for Crimea to secede from Ukraine.",,,

471,17,17,Yanukovych showed up in Moscow on 26 February after leaving Ukraine with Russian assistance.,,,
471,18,18,"On 27-28 February, unidentified soldiers (widely suspected, and later confirmed to have been Russian special forces) seized several government buildings and airports in Crimea, sparking a crisis for Ukraine.",,,
471,19,19,"Ukraines major response to its crisis was verbal and began on 27 February, when it sent a note to Russia demanding that Russian troops stay on base in Crimea, called for calm, and discussed the situation with Russia.",,,
471,20,20,"The following day, Ukraine called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the final part of its major response.",,,

471,26,26,Pro-Russian protests in the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass region in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Crimea was annexed.,,,
471,27,27,"At some point soon thereafter, Russia began to conduct military exercises in Rostov and other points near its border with eastern Ukraine, and it also began massing troops in the area, all with the intent to try and force Ukraine to back down in Donbass without having to resort to violence.",,,

471,35,35,"Despite publicly denying an interest in intervening in Donbass, Russia increased its troop presence along Ukraines southeastern border and began another series of military exercises on 23 April, raising concerns that it might conduct a full-fledged military intervention in Donbass if Ukraine appeared to be winning the conflict.",,,
471,36,36,Russia and Ukraine were involved in a simultaneous dispute over the latters natural gas debt to the former.,,,
471,37,37,"Gazprom, one of Russias largest oil companies, was demanding advance payments for natural gas until Ukraine paid off its debts.",,,
471,38,38,Ukraine perceived this as a Russian political maneuver related to the larger security and territorial issues at stake in the crisis.,,,
471,39,39,"In May, the European Union (EU) Energy Commissioner began talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to sort out a repayment plan that would keep the gas from being cut off.",,,
471,40,40,"The Ukrainian pipelines also supply Europe, so there was a shared interest in resolving the debt dispute.",,,
471,41,41,"On 15 June, talks over Ukraines natural gas debt broke down.",,,
471,42,42,Russia cut the natural gas pipeline to Ukraine the following day.,,,
