456,Djibouti–Eritrea,"A crisis occurred between Djibouti and Eritrea over the disputed border region of Ras Doumeira from 7 April to the end of June 2008. Djibouti and Eritrea share a border of 110 km which was initially drawn by Italy and France in 1900, following a dispute in 1898. Although Djibouti and Eritrea had a skirmish and a two-month standoff in 1996, the relations between the two had improved after 2000. More than 1,200 US troops and 2,850 French troops are stationed in Djibouti. Eritrea also has an unresolved border conflict with Ethiopia that has resulted in three crises (cases #424, #446, and #456) since 1998. PRE-CRISIS: According to a Djiboutian report, Eritrea started to deploy military equipment in their common border region in early 2008, in the name of road construction.  ","The crisis began on 7 April 2008 when Eritrean armed forces penetrated into Djiboutian territory, dug trenches on both sides of the border, and occupied Ras-Doumeira. This triggered a crisis for Djibouti. Eritrea denied the charge. The Djiboutian army made a request to probe the situation, which Eritrea also denied. From 7 to 22 April, the two sides pursued negotiations. This also constituted Djibouti’s major response to the crisis trigger. Several rounds of futile negotiations followed. Presidents Isaias Afwerki of Ethiopia and Ismaïl Omar Guelleh of Djibouti were involved in these efforts. On 22 April, Djibouti sent its troops to the border area, and negotiations between the two sides ceased. On 5 May, Djibouti took the case to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the African Union (AU), and the Arab League, all of which urged Djibouti and Eritrea to exercise restraint. Despite the various diplomatic activities and mediation attempts by regional organizations such as the AU and Arab League and friendly countries such as Yemen, Eritrea refused further dialogue with Djibouti. Eritrea also rejected fact finding missions dispatched by both the AU and the Arab League. The military standoff in Ras Doumeira eventually led to clashes between the two sides on 10 June, which triggered a crisis for Eritrea. Eritrea’s major response occurred that same day and consisted of violence. The fighting lasted four days until 13 June, at which point the crisis faded for Eritrea. At least nine Djiboutian soldiers were killed and more than fifty were wounded. Eritrea denied the existence of the armed conflict and refused to reveal the death toll. Despite Eritrea’s denial of the conflict, the UNSC issued a presidential statement (S/PRST/2008/20) on 12 June condemning Eritrea’s military action against Djibouti in Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island. Also, both the AU and the Arab League urged the two countries to remain calm and resolve the dispute peacefully.  On 16 June, France sent three ships, including a frigate and a helicopter carrier to assist Djibouti with medical care, logistics, and intelligence. France did not participate directly in fighting between the two sides. By the end of June, tensions subsided and the crisis faded for Djibouti. Djibouti withdrew its forces, which the UNSC had earlier called upon both sides to do.  "
457,Preah Vihear Temple I,"Background: From 8 July 2008 to 24 August 2009, a crisis took place for Thailand and Cambodia over an ancient temple located along their shared border. The temple, Preah Vihear, was the subject of a long-standing dispute between the two countries. In 1962, the International Court of Justice awarded ownership of the temple to Cambodia. PRE-CRISIS: In March 2008, Cambodia attempted to unilaterally inscribe Preah Vihear in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) list of World Heritage Sites and informed Thailand of its plans. This attempt was initially supported by the Thai government led by Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, a position that was unpopular with and used as a key rallying point by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) (also known as the Yellow Shirts), a domestic opposition movement that attempted to topple Sundaravej. In June 2008, Thailand and Cambodia issued a joint communiqué regarding the temple registration. Increasing domestic unrest and a ruling by the Thai Constitutional Court that found the communiqué to be unconstitutional led to an alteration in the Thai stance on Cambodia’s move to unilaterally inscribe Preah Vihear prior to the outbreak of the crisis. Embattled Prime Minister Sundaravej eventually withdrew his bid to regain his seat in September 2008, and Thai Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama resigned several days after crisis outbreak as a result of the Thai Constitutional Court ruling.  ","Summary: On 8 July 2008, UNESCO announced that Preah Vihear temple was included in the list of World Heritage Sites, triggering a crisis for Thailand. Thailand’s major response was deploying military troops to its border area with Cambodia on 15 July. Cambodia claimed that 50 Thai solders crossed into Cambodian territory about 300 meters from the Preah Vihear temple that day, triggering a crisis for Cambodia. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen believed that the Thai deployment threatened Cambodia’s national security. Sen’s major response was to send military troops to the area that same day by. Over the next several days, the number of Thai and Cambodian soldiers deployed to the area increased to 480 and 800, respectively. On 17 July, Cambodian Prime Minister Sen implemented the other parts of its major response to the perceived crisis trigger by making telephone contact with and sending a written letter to Thai Prime Minister Sundaravej calling for action to defuse the tension and the immediate withdrawal of Thai troops. The following day, Sundaravej responded with a letter to Cambodia insisting that the area around the temple where Thai troops deployed is Thai territory. On 21 July, high-level talks occurred between the Thai army commander and the Cambodian defense minister during a special meeting of the Thai-Cambodian General Border Committee (GBC), but no outcome was achieved. From July to September 2008, both sides dramatically increased their troop deployments in the border region, and the confrontation incrementally deteriorated further. Violence erupted on 3 October, with both sides blaming one another for instigating the clash. On 14 October,  Cambodian Prime Minister Sen proposed that both sides withdraw troops, but Thailand rejected this proposal. On 15 October, the two sides exchanged fire again. Tensions between the two sides remained high throughout late 2008 and early 2009. No negotiations occurred between the two sides during this period, but neither did violence. On 3 April 2009, fighting broke out again between the two countries after apparent disagreements between troops over access to the disputed area. A Thai soldier crossed into Cambodian territory and stepped on a landmine. The two sides subsequently exchanged artillery, mortar, and grenade fire. Tensions continued until late August 2009, when both sides engaged in deescalatory moves. On 22 August, Cambodian Prime Minister Sen announced troop reductions in the border region, proposing a cut of 50 percent. In response, a Thai general said Thailand would do the same. Two days later on 24 August, top military leaders of Cambodia and Thailand met in Phnom Penh and officially announced troop reductions and an end to hostilities. This terminated the crisis for both sides. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was involved in the crisis in a low-level manner. ASEAN attempted to set up a “contact group” to mediate the standoff between Thailand and Cambodia but decided against it on 22 July 2008 after Thailand opposed the idea on the grounds that the two countries should try to resolve the dispute bilaterally before seeking the help of outsiders. ASEAN discussed the crisis in its general meeting and encouraged both parties to resolve the conflict through bilateral talks. Cambodia appealed to the UN Security Council (UNSC) to take up the case, but ASEAN persuaded the UNSC to not do so. ASEAN preferred that the parties resolve the situation bilaterally and was also concerned about potential harm to its organizational reputation and credibility had the parties too quickly resorted to UN Security Council action to solve the crisis. At a November 2009 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, after the crisis terminated, the Thai prime minister asked Indonesia to help resolve the conflict in its role as chair of ASEAN. Reluctant to get involved in other countries’ internal affairs, Indonesia denied the request, saying that the two sides can manage the issue without additional third party involvement.  "
458,Russo-Georgian War,"Background: From 7 to 16 August 2008, Russia and Georgia experienced a crisis known regionally as the Five-Day War (also known as the Russo-Georgian War or the August War). Since its independence, Georgia has struggled to stabilize major separatist movements located in three regions that are internationally recognized as part of Georgian territory: Adzharia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Both the South Ossetian and Abkhazian separatist movements are backed by Russia. This state of affairs has led to three prior crises between Georgia and Russia, the most recent occurring from June to November 2004 (see Case #445). Russian peacekeepers were sent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the wake of armed conflicts in both regions in the early 1990s and have remained stationed there until the present day. PRE-CRISIS: On 29 April 2008, Russia announced a unilateral increase of peacekeepers in Georgian-populated areas of Abkhazia. This increased tensions between Russia and Georgia. In July, several explosions in South Ossetia killed locals, including a police chief. The spokesperson of South Ossetia claimed that the bombings were assassinations conducted by Georgian secret services. Georgia claimed that the bombings were done by Russia to justify its presence in South Ossetia. Following these bombings, South Ossetia prepared for war, which provoked Georgia in turn.  ","Summary: According to Georgia, Russia began moving its troops toward battle areas inside South Ossetia on 7 August 2008, which triggered a crisis for Georgia. Georgia’s major response was to mobilize its reservists and declare a 15-day “state of war” the next day, which in turn triggered a crisis for Russia. Russia initiated its major response that same day by clashing with Georgian forces in South Ossetia, while also requesting an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Russian troops were backed by separatist Abkhaz forces in their military efforts. Russia stated that its goal was to protect its peacekeepers and ethnic Russians in South Ossetia. Five days of heavy fighting occurred between the two sides. Georgian forces were defeated in most battles and retreated on 11 August, enabling the Russians to occupy several Georgian cities. On 9 August, Foreign Minister of the European Union, Bernard Kouchner, flew to Tbilisi together with Finnish Foreign Minister and OSCE chairman, Alexander Stubb. The following morning, they drafted a tentative ceasefire proposal on three key issues: a cessation of hostilities, recognition of Georgia’s territorial integrity, and rapid re-establishment of the status quo. On 12 August, a mediation effort conducted by the EU and OSCE began as then president of the EU, Nicolas Sarkozy, presented this plan to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. A preliminary ceasefire agreement was signed by the parties that same day. Based on the proposal presented by Sarkozy, he and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev drafted the “six principles” of a peace plan. On 13 August, Georgia requested revisions of the terms of the plan, to which Russia agreed. On 15 August, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the revised peace agreement during a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State. Medvedev signed the agreement the following day. This terminated the crisis for both sides. The peace agreement was unanimously supported by all members of the EU. The agreement was sent to the UNSC to be formalized. The UNSC had attempted to agree on a statement calling for a truce while the fighting was ongoing during the crisis, but it failed. Most of the Russian forces stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained there under bilateral agreements with the corresponding governments until 2010, when Russia began troop withdrawals. Moscow claimed that the Five-Day War killed more than 2,000 civilians, but the official EU report estimated that the casualties were around 850 with over 2,000 wounded.  "
459,North Korea Nuclear IV: Satellite Launch,"Background: A crisis surrounding the launch of a satellite and a nuclear test by North Korea began on 11 March 2009 and lasted until 4 August 2009. Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were the crisis actors. This was the fourth crisis related to North Korea’s nuclear program (see cases #408, 441, and 450). Though Japan was involved in each of the previous three crises in this protracted conflict, this was the first in which Japan perceived a foreign policy crisis itself. It was also the first time since the end of World War II that Japan was involved in a crisis as a crisis actor. PRE-CRISIS: Rumors of a planned missile launch by North Korea began circulating in February 2009, when South Korean sources said that North Korea was assembling the Taepodong-2 rocket at a missile base on its east coast. On 24 February, the South Korean media reported that North Korean preparations for launching an experimental communications satellite were underway. Japan, South Korea, and the United States warned North Korea that the planned satellite launch would be in violation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1718 that called on North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear programs. They also indicated that the Security Council would consider further action should North Korea go through with the launch. North Korea responded that the launch was part of a legitimate and peaceful space program and that shooting it down would be an act of war.  ","Summary: On 11 March 2009, North Korea announced a time frame for its satellite launch, turning its previous general statements about a potential future launch into a concrete situation with a finite time frame. This triggered a crisis for Japan, South Korea, and the United States, all three of which believed that the satellite launch was actually a disguised missile test (a perception held by many other members of the international community as well). The following day the United States implemented the most important part of its major response by moving naval forces to South Korea to participate in joint military drills. The drills occurred that same day, and while they were a regularly scheduled annual exercise, two US ships capable of intercepting the North Korean launch remained after the drills were completed and were hosted by South Korea. This triggered a crisis for North Korea that same day. South Korea’s major response to the crisis trigger consisted of hosting the US ships after the joint military drills were completed on 12 March, and most importantly, an announcement on 18 March that it would deploy an interception-capable destroyer to track North Korea’s planned missile launch. Also on 18 March, Japan announced that it was considering deploying its own naval units capable of interception in coordination with the United States; this constituted the most important part of its major response. North Korea reiterated that an attempt to intercept the launch would be considered an act of war. Over the following two days, North Korea rejected further American food aid, despite continuing need, and detained two American journalists. Japan, South Korea, and the United States mobilized Aegis-equipped destroyers to potentially intercept debris from the launch in late March. On 5 April, North Korea proceeded with the launch. The decision to go through with these drills represented North Korea’s major response to its crisis trigger. No interception attempt or damage from debris occurred. North Korea claimed that the launch was a success and that the satellite was sent into orbit, but much of the international community contends that the payload fell into the Pacific Ocean without reaching orbit. The launch of the rocket was sharply condemned by the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and the United States as a clear violation of UNSC Resolution 1718. On 13 April, the UN Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the rocket launch, and declaring it a violation of Resolution 1718. In response, North Korea withdrew from the six-party talks and stated that it would no longer be bound by any agreements previously reached under the talks. On 16 April, North Korea expelled International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and US monitors from the Yongbyon nuclear complex. On 25 May, North Korea conducted its second underground nuclear test, which was met with condemnation from the international community. In response to the test, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1874 on June 12, formally condemning the test and tightening sanctions on North Korea. In July, a number of North Korean entities were designated for sanctions, which was a follow-up step in the implementation of Resolution 1874. Tensions began to slowly fade until 4 August, when former US President Bill Clinton visited North Korea and secured the release of the US journalists detained by North Korea. This led to a return to pre-crisis levels of all four crisis actors’ perceptions of threat, thus terminating the Crisis.  "
460,Chad-Sudan V,"Background: A crisis occurred between Chad and Sudan from 5 May 2009 to 9 February 2010. Since 2004, tensions had been high between Chad and Sudan. Chad accused Sudan of supporting Chadian rebels, and Sudan accused Chad of supporting Sudanese rebels. Previous crises erupted between the two states in 2005, 2006, and twice in 2007. The most recent crisis between Chad and Sudan terminated on 1 August 2008 with the reestablishment of diplomatic ties following efforts of multiple mediators (see case #455; the other crises between Chad and Sudan are cases #447, #449, and #453). Earlier in that crisis, in March 2008, Chad and Sudan signed the Dakar Agreement, a broader accord in which they agreed to stop supporting each other's rebel groups, resolve their overall differences with one another, and commit to upholding a series of previous failed peace agreements. The primary mediation effort in that crisis was conducted by a large “contact group” consisting of several African states and a group of high-profile international guarantors and was tasked with helping to implement the Dakar Agreement. This effort ultimately failed to achieve its objective: the contact group met a number of times in the months following the crisis but then failed to meet again after 11 November 2008 despite several attempts. Qatar began a separate mediation effort in early 2009, meeting with Sudan in late February and then Chad in early March. But a definitive resolution of the conflict between Chad and Sudan remained elusive, as the overall peace process between Chad and Sudan once again stalled and the two sides continued to support each other’s rebel groups.  ","Summary: The crisis began on 5 May 2009 when the Sudanese-backed Union of Resistance Forces (URF/UFR) crossed the border from Sudanese to Chadian territory. This triggered a crisis for Chad. Chad’s major response consisted of both an accusation toward Sudan that same day and, most importantly, a military attack against the rebels two days later. On 5 May, Chad publically accused Sudan of backing the rebel incursion. This triggered a crisis for Sudan. Sudan’s major response was to deny that it supported URF the following day; URF also denied that it was receiving support from Sudan. Then, on 7 May, Chadian military forces engaged the URF in the Battle of Am Dam. The battle resulted in more than 200 deaths and a victory for the Chadian government. Sudan claimed that the Chadian Air Force also conducted strikes against URF rebels within Sudanese territory. Sudan characterized these airstrikes as “acts of war” and threatened to shoot down Chadian planes if they crossed into Sudanese airspace again. In the months that followed, Chad and Sudan engaged in several exchanges of air strikes, and Chadian troops conducted several incursions across its border with Sudan. Chad also continued to intermittently clash with URF, albeit at a lower level than in May. Tensions between Chad and Sudan remained high, and Sudan continued to deny that it was supporting Chadian rebels. On 25 December, Chad and Sudan agreed to implement previous protocols that addressed controlling the border between the two countries. There were no more major clashes after this point. On 15 January 2010, another agreement was signed by Chad and Sudan, this time mediated by Libya. The agreement reduced tensions somewhat but did not terminate the crisis. On 9 February 2010, Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Sudan and met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. During the visit, Chad and Sudan signed a formal agreement in which they agreed that neither would support rebel organizations targeting the other. This returned the perceived level of threat to pre-crisis level, terminating the crisis for both sides. Libya and Qatar coordinated in mediating between Chad and Sudan during the crisis. Qatar originally began its mediation effort alone and prior to the crisis period, but it was eventually joined by Libya. Qatar was more active early and for most of the crisis, but Libya was more active at the end. The Qatarese Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, led the Qatarese part of the effort, and Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi led the Libyan part of the effort. Libya’s mediation of the 15 January 2010 agreement between Chad and Sudan had a marginal positive effect on crisis abatement, reducing tensions between the two countries to some degree less than a month before they bilaterally terminated the crisis. Both Qatar’s and Libya’s mediation was facilitative in nature. The United States was also involved in the crisis as a mediator of the conflict between the Sudanese government and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel group in Darfur. US President Barack Obama’s special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force General J. Scott Gration, led this effort. The US effort was effective and also had a positive indirect influence on the resolution of the international crisis between Chad and Sudan because Chad was supporting JEM. However, the US did not directly mediate the international crisis between Chad and Sudan. The United Nations (UN) and African Union (AU) were minimally involved in the crisis. Rodolphe Adada, the UN-AU Joint Special Representative (JSR) in Darfur and head of the joint UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), called on Chad and Sudan to end their hostile interactions and resolve their conflict peacefully via negotiations. The AU also condemned the two sides’ use of force to resolve their differences.  "
461,Cheonan Sinking,"Background: South Korea and North Korea experienced a four-month crisis over the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan on 26 March 2010. The area where the Cheonan sinking incident happened has always been a site of considerable tension between South Korea and North Korea. The situation is further complicated by the presence of a rich fishing ground in the area used by North Korean and Chinese fishing vessels. There were numerous clashes over the years between South Korean and North Korean naval vessels attempting to police what both sides regard as their territorial waters. PRE-CRISIS: On the night of the sinking of the Cheonan, the United States and South Korean navies were engaged in joint anti-submarine exercises 75 miles away from the site of the sinking. This exercise was part of the two countries’ annual Key Resolve/Foal Eagle war exercise, described by the US Pentagon as “one of the world’s largest simulated exercises,” and involved modern US and South Korean warships.  ","Summary: On 26 March 2010, an explosion was reported to have occurred near the ROKS Cheonan, a South Korean warship. This triggered a crisis for South Korea. Initial reports suggested that the ship was hit by a North Korean torpedo, and that a South Korean vessel had returned fire. Of the ship’s crew of 104 men, 46 died. South Korean officials initially downplayed suggestions that North Korea was responsible for the sinking. After raising the ship, South Korea and the US formed a joint investigative team to discover the cause of the sinking; South Korea led the team. A second, separate, and broader South Korean-led investigative effort followed; the US, Sweden, Australia, and the United Kingdom also participated in this effort. On 19 May, this second investigative team concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the ship. Around this time, North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-Il, ordered North Korea's forces to be ready for combat. Near the end of May, a team of Russian experts visited South Korea to conduct an assessment of the results produced by the second South Korean-led investigation. The Russian assessment concluded that the Cheonan was not sunk by a North Korean bubble jet torpedo, but it did not come to any firm conclusion about the cause of the sinking. After the release of the official report in which North Korea was blamed for the sinking, South Korea announced on 24 May that it would stop nearly all of its trade with North Korea and prohibit North Korean vessels from using its shipping channels. This constituted South Korea’s major response to the crisis trigger, and it in turn triggered a crisis for North Korea. That same day, South Korea also demanded an apology from North Korea for the sinking and announced a resumption of “psychological warfare” tactics aimed at North Korea. Also on the same day, President Lee Myung-bak said that South Korea would respond to further military provocations from North Korea with self-defense measures, and that he supported readopting the official description of the North as the “main enemy.” Finally on that day, the US and South Korea announced that they would conduct joint naval exercises in response to the sinking. North Korea’s major response to the South Korean embargo that triggered its crisis came on 25 May and consisted of putting its troops on high alert and reverting to a wartime footing in  Regard to South Korea. That same day, North Korea also severed most remaining ties and communications with South Korea, with the exception of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and forbade any South Korean ships or aircraft from entering North Korean territory. Also that day, the South Korean military resumed “psychological warfare” directed at North Korea as planned; this included both loudspeaker and FM radio propaganda broadcasts across the Demilitarized Zone. On 27 May, North Korea announced that it would scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea. It also announced that any South Korean vessel found crossing the disputed maritime border would be immediately attacked. The following day, the North Korean Central News Agency released an official response to the second South Korean-led investigation, denying having had anything to do with the sinking. On 14 June, South Korea presented the results of its investigation to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). On 9 July, the UNSC issued a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker. Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the US and South Korea launched joint military exercises on 25 July despite strong objections from China. The exercises were focused on anti-submarine and maritime interdiction capabilities. Hostile rhetoric from both sides gradually died down and tensions started to fade after the military exercises. The crisis terminated for both sides on 26 July without a clear-cut terminating act. The US and China were both involved in the crisis. The US was mainly involved via its staging of joint military exercises with South Korea, but it also condemned North Korea. China voiced strong opposition to the joint US-South Korean military exercises, but its main involvement was effectively resisting US calls for a tougher line against North Korea throughout the crisis. The UN’s condemnation of the attack had little to no effect on the crisis proceedings. NATO also condemned the attack, but went further than the UN by singling out North Korea’s role in the attack. Nevertheless, NATO’s involvement also did not contribute to crisis abatement.  "
462,Yeonpyeong Island,"Background: A crisis involving North Korea and South Korea surrounding incidents on the disputed Yeonpyeong Island occurred between 23 November 2010 and 19 June 2011. The crisis occurred amidst the backdrop of a long-running maritime border dispute between North and South Korea. The US was also significantly involved in the crisis, mainly due to its holding of military exercises with South Korea both before and during the crisis. Yeonpyeong Island lies on the South Korean side of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the maritime boundary between the North and South Korea that was drawn up by the United Nations after the end of the Korean War in 1953. North Korea accepted this demarcation for almost two decades before it began disputing it in the 1970s. Tensions surrounding the boundary decreased in the wake of a 1991 non-aggression pact between the two Koreas, but re-escalated when North Korea began disputing the boundary again in the mid-1990s. Minor military incidents occurred between the two sides near Yeonpyeong Island in 1999 and 2002. On 10 November 2009, another skirmish between the South and North Korea navies occurred near the NLL. Tensions further intensified after the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, in March 2010 (see case #461). PRE-CRISIS: Tensions increased further between South Korea and North Korea in the month prior to the crisis. On 14 October 2010, South Korea hosted Exercise Eastern Endeavor, a naval drill also involving the United States, Japan, and Australia. This drill was part of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), a multinational effort aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. North Korea denounced the drill as an open declaration of war, as it did in 2009 when South Korea joined the PSI in the wake of a North Korean nuclear test. Then, on 16 November 2010, South Korea announced that it would launch a large-scale annual military exercise, the Hoguk Exercise, with the US the following week. North Korea viewed the exercise as preparation for war. Hours before the exercise began on 23 November, North Korea wired a complaint, said that it would not “just sit back while the South is carrying out the livefire exercise,” and warned of military action if South Korea and the U.S. fired in its territorial Waters.  ","Summary: On 23 November 2010, South Korea and the US held the Hoguk Exercise on Yeonpyeong Island as previously announced, which triggered a crisis for North Korea. North Korea’s major response consisted of firing artillery shells onto Yeonpyeong Island that same day, which triggered a crisis for South Korea. Following an emergency meeting of top aides and security ministers called by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, South Korea implemented its major response by firing back at the North Korean military that same day. The exchange of fire intensified for a short while before ending in the afternoon that day. Shortly afterwards that same day, South Korea and the US announced that they planned another round of similar military exercises for some time between 17 and 21 December. North Korea responded it would consider such exercises a grave provocation and would respond appropriately. In the aftermath of the attack, South Korean President Lee received much domestic public criticism for not responding more forcefully. On 25 November, the South Korean defense minister resigned; South Korea announced a dramatic troop and heavy weapon increase on Yeonpyeong Island; and President Lee announced changes to the rules of engagement permitting a more forceful military response, particularly if civilians are threatened. North Korea threatened further military action if South Korea continued what, according to North Korea, was a course of military provocation. On 28 November, China proposed emergency consultations by representatives of the six-party talks to try and help resolve the crisis. China’s proposal was rejected by the US, South Korea, and Japan. On 18 December, Russia’s ambassador to the UN appealed for an emergency UNSC meeting. The meeting was held the following day. Russia presented a draft statement with the hopes of adoption by the UNSC, but it could not secure sufficient support. China opposed including language in the statement that would criticize North Korea. Around this time, New Mexico Governor and former US diplomat Bill Richardson accepted an invitation from North Korea to try and reduce tensions. Richardson conducted a four-day mission in Pyongyang as a private citizen beginning on 16 December. On 20 December, Richardson reported that North Korea was willing to discuss the formation of a military commission consisting of representatives from North Korea, South Korea and the US that would monitor and prevent conflicts in the disputed areas in the Yellow Sea. Richardson also reported that North Korea agreed to allow monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its uranium-enrichment facility. The White House rejected the idea of new multinational talks with North Korea, and said it needed to change its belligerent behavior first. From 20 to 25 December, South Korea carried out naval drills on Yeonpyeong Island and the Sea of Japan. On 23 December, North Korea called South Korea’s exercises a preparation for war and threatened a nuclear deterrent response. In January 2011, North Korea proposed working-level military talks with South Korea. These talks began on 8 February but ended abruptly with both sides blaming the other for the failed talks. North Korea claimed that the South made unreasonable demands and was uninterested in improving ties. South Korea wanted the talks to focus on the Cheonan and Yeonpyeong incidents and claimed that the North maintained its refusal to apologize and accept responsibility for these incidents. For the next several months, tensions began to slowly ease but nevertheless continued to simmer and remain unresolved, with little headway made toward abatement. Then, on 19 June, facing the threat of another possible nuclear test from North Korea, South Korea announced that while it still wanted an apology from North Korea over the 2010 incidents, it would no longer make such an apology a prerequisite for restarting the six-party talks. After this statement, the crisis faded for both North Korea and South Korea.  "
463,Preah Vihear Temple II,"Background: A second crisis for Thailand and Cambodia over the long-disputed ancient Preah Vihear temple took place from 4 February to 21 December 2011. Tensions over the temple first reached crisis level in 2008, when the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) approved Cambodia’s unilateral application to list the temple as a World Heritage site. That crisis saw significant troop deployments and a series of clashes between the two sides near the site of the temple, and it terminated with a bilateral agreement to reduce troop deployment levels at the site. But neither side fully removed its forces from the area, nor was the issue of sovereign control of the temple and the surrounding area resolved (see case #457). PRE-CRISIS: Thailand requested assistance from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in November 2009 to help resolve the conflict, reversing its prior stance against ASEAN intervention. ASEAN rejected the request and expressed its view that the two sides should resolve the conflict bilaterally. Intermittent clashes erupted between Thailand and Cambodia over the temple in January and April 2010. The Thai military claimed that the clashes were caused by misunderstandings, and these incidents did not escalate to the level of crisis. In August 2010, Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen called for an international conference to discuss the dispute, but Thailand rejected the call.  ","Summary: On 4 February 2011, Thai and Cambodian troops battled near the Preah Vihear temple. This triggered a crisis for both sides. The initiator of the clashes was unclear, and both sides claimed the other side fired first. The major responses from both Thailand and Cambodia consisted of further military clashes and, later that day, a phone conversation between Thai Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh. The phone call was initiated by Wongsuwan. The two countries discussed the border clash and the conditions for a ceasefire. A ceasefire was reached, but clashes resumed shortly thereafter. Immediately after the first armed clash, Cambodia asked the UN Security Council (UNSC) to convene an urgent meeting. Thereafter, the UNSC invited envoys from Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia, then chair of ASEAN, to discuss the issue. Both Hun Sen and his Thai counterpart, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, submitted facts to the UNSC and claimed that the other party initiated the armed attack. On 7 February, a short UN mediation effort occurred when representatives from Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia met with UNSC members to discuss the issue. The same day, the UNSC released a press statement expressing its “grave concern” over the situation and support of ASEAN attempts to initiate a separate mediation effort between Thailand and Cambodia. On 21 February, ASEAN held an informal regional group meeting in Jakarta to seek a solution to the dispute, beginning the primary mediation effort between the two sides. The foreign ministersto monitor disputed border territory. Despite such efforts, armed clashes broke out again in April and spread to the Thai province of Surin. Another ceasefire agreement soon followed. On 28 April, Cambodia approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ), requesting it to interpret its 1962 judgment regarding the temple. Thailand asked the court to drop the case, maintaining its position in favor of a bilateral framework. In July, the ICJ released its ruling; the judges voted unanimously to reject Thailand’s claim over the temple. Furthermore, the court issued provisional measures, ordering both Thailand and Cambodia to withdraw troops from the disputed area and send observers, consisting of Thai, Cambodian, and Indonesian representatives. Cambodia accepted the ICJ ruling. Thai political leaders initially accepted the decision but reversed this position after the Thai military objected to the deployment of observers in particular, claiming that such a deployment would undermine Thai national sovereignty. In the meantime, Indonesia had proposed a “solution package” on 9 May that included a threestep process consisting of: 1) agreeing to the terms of reference, 2) assigning the team of Indonesia observers, and 3) resuming talks under the General Border Committee (GBC) and Joint Boundary Commission (JBC), the bilateral mechanisms for resolving the border conflict that were created in 1995 and 2000, respectively. Thailand, however, requested to postpone meetings of the GBC and JBC due to upcoming national elections in July, and then an unprecedented flood in the fall. Another minor armed clash occurred on 15 December, followed by an apology by Cambodia. Six days later, Cambodia hosted a meeting of the GBC in Phnom Penh. Both parties agreed to withdraw their troops, establish a “provisional demilitarized zone,” set up a Joint Working Group to help complete the troop withdrawal, and send observers as the ICJ ordered. This agreement terminated the crisis for Cambodia and Thailand. Although the agreement was oral and Indonesian observers were never sent, both sides withdrew their troops in July 2012. The ASEAN mediation effort that began in February lasted until a Foreign Ministers Meeting on 19 July. An ASEAN summit occurred in November as well, and ASEAN called on both sides to peacefully resolve their differences with the engagement of Indonesia, but no meeting to discuss the border dispute occurred at this summit. of Cambodia and Thailand both attended the meeting and agreed to allow Indonesian observers  To monitor disputed border territory.

464,Libyan Civil War,"Background: A crisis occurred from 22 February 2011 to 20 October 2011 between Libya and a coalition of international actors (mostly NATO members) that were opposed to the brutal repression by Muammar Gaddafi’s regime of anti-government protesters and rebel supporters during an emerging civil war. The anti-Gaddafi coalition states that experienced a crisis included the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar. A dozen other NATO and non-NATO regional actors were also involved in the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya. PRE-CRISIS: In mid-January 2011, inspired in part by the civil uprising that occurred earlier in Tunisia, small protests began to emerge in Libya, focusing on issues such as corruption, local concerns, and a desire for greater political freedoms. These eventually gave way to mass demonstrations against the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli and Benghazi beginning in early February. By mid-February, protests spread to the rest of the country and civilians began demanding that Gaddafi step down. The Gaddafi regime responded with a violent repression campaign against demonstrators. Repression escalated significantly beginning on 16 February, and reports of mass killings occurred on 17 and 19 February. This attracted significant attention and condemnation from the international community. On 16 February, Human Rights Watch called for intervention in Libya, particularly from the members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). On 18 February, the US condemned the violence and voiced support for democratic reforms and economic openness in Libya and other states that were part of the Arab Spring. On 19 February, the UK called for an immediate end to the use of force against civilians. On 21 February, Canada also condemned the violence. That same day, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, met with Gaddafi, and the UN Deputy Permanent Representative for Libya, Ibrahim Dabbashi, called on the UN to impose a no-fly zone over Tripoli.  ","Summary: On 22 February 2011, the escalating protests and repression in Libya reached a tipping point. Libya responded to mass protests against the regime that day with military force, including the use of helicopter gunships, artillery fire, and snipers. On the same day, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi delivered a potent speech in which he threatened to show no mercy to protestors, urged his loyalists to attack protesters and their supporters, and vowed to never resign or leave Libya. The culmination of escalating repression and Gaddafi’s speech triggered foreign policy crises for the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar. The major responses from these states were multi-faceted, beginning with condemnations on 22-23 February, escalating quickly to more substantial political and/or economic pressure, and culminating in mid-March with the most important general response: UN authorization and implementation of a no-fly zone in order to protect Libyan civilians. On 23 February, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the European Union to impose sanctions against Libya and suggested that the assets of the Gaddafi family should be frozen. On 25 February, the US closed its embassy in Tripoli and imposed unilateral economic sanctions on Libya, including the freezing of billions in Libyan government assets. That same day, Canada began Operation MOBILE, a non-combatant mission in which armed forces were sent to facilitate the evacuation of Canadian citizens and other  foreign nationals from Libya. On 26 February, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1970, which imposed sanctions on Libya and referred the situation to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. The sanctions included an arms embargo and a travel ban and asset freeze on members of the Gaddafi regime. On 28 February, Italy suspended its friendship treaty with Libya, a treaty that also included a nonaggression clause. On 3 March, the US threatened to impose military sanctions on Libya, including a no-fly zone, and Obama issued the first public statement in which he demanded that Gaddafi step down and leave Libya. Early condemnations and calls for action also came from the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on 22 February and the African Union (AU) one day later. The Arab League’s involvement was most important: on 12 March, it called on the UN to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. This helped to spur and legitimize an effort from the wider international community to do the same. The AU called for a transition to a post-Gaddafi Libya, but advocated for a negotiated process. On 17 March, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace in order to protect civilians. The resolution was proposed by the UK, France, and Lebanon. Voting to adopt this resolution constituted the most important part of the major responses to the crisis trigger from the UK, US, and France. The passing of the UNSC resolution triggered a crisis for Libya. The Libyan foreign minister, Moussa Koussa, declared a ceasefire later that day, framing it as a response to the UN resolution. However, Libyan artillery shelling on Misrata and Ajdabiya continued, and government soldiers continued approaching Benghazi. On 19 March, Libya issued its major response in the form of a public statement from Gaddafi in which he harshly condemned the UNSC resolution and vowed to arm the Libyan people and fight to the end to protect them from “colonial, crusader” aggression. That same day, Libyan government troops and tanks entered Benghazi, and artillery and mortars were fired into the city. Enforcement of the no-fly zone also began on 19 March. This constituted the most important part of Canada’s and Italy’s major responses to the crisis trigger. Airstrike operations led by the UK, the US, France, and Canada were launched against Gaddafi’s forces in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Misrata that day. Qatari fighter jets joined the enforcement effort the following day, which constituted the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger. These operations were eventually merged into a single NATO operation named Operation Unified Protector. The establishment of the no-fly zone provided vital assistance to the Libyan opposition groups. As the Libyan state was dealt heavy blows from both the domestic opposition and the foreign interveners, the international community began recognizing the National Transition Council (NTC) as the official representative of the Libyan people. In June, Gaddafi offered to hold elections and promised to step aside if he lost, but this offer was rejected by the NTC. On 20 August, the NTC began a major offensive in the form of the Battle of Tripoli and ultimately took control of the Libyan capital. Qatari special forces supported Libyan rebels in their attack on Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya during this battle. Forces of Operation Unified Protector continued to fly thousands of sorties in support of the Libyan opposition.  The Libyan opposition completed their goal of removing Gaddafi from power in the Battle of Sirte on 20 October, and Gaddafi was killed in the aftermath of the battle. This effectively ended the civil war, constituted a change in the Libyan regime, and terminated the crisis for all actors. Operation Unified Protector officially came to a close on 31 October 2011, which was also the day that Abdel Rahim al-Keeb assumed the office of interim Prime Minister of Libya after being appointed to the position by the NTC. At the outset of the crisis, humanitarian concerns were paramount for the NATO members that perceived a crisis. The situation in Libya constituted a threat to non-material, moral values, specifically human rights, and invoked the Responsibility to Protect norm. Italy also had economic concerns, as it received 25% of its oil and 10% of its natural gas from Libya, and the two countries were heavily mutually invested in each other. France also perceived a threat to influence, adopting a strong anti-regime stance in order to help recover its reputation after taking failed pro-regime stances in several prior Arab Spring uprisings (e.g., Tunisia, Egypt). A number of the European crisis actors also had concerns about the possible influx of refugees. Qatar was primarily motivated by the opportunity to expand its regional influence. Operation Unified Protector had both air and naval components. Qatar only contributed to the air component, while all other members of the coalition that were also crisis actors contributed to both components. During the operation, the US flew the largest number of sorties (2000), followed by the UK and France (1300 and 1200, respectively), and then Italy and Canada (600 and 358, respectively). The US also provided covert support for NATO and the Libyan rebels. Qatar’s combat deployment was the first by an Arab or Muslim-majority country and thus of critical regional and diplomatic significance. It was also the only country to commit ground troops to the effort, sending hundreds of special forces to train and fight alongside the Libyan opposition. Qatar also provided weapons to the opposition. Additional NATO and non-NATO countries that were involved in the enforcement of the no-fly zone, albeit to a lesser degree than the crisis actors, included Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Jordan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Russia and China were minimally involved in the crisis. Russia abstained from the UNSC vote on Resolution 1973, but both the Russian representative to the UN and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin heavily criticized it. Russia and China also signed a joint declaration emphasizing the need for a political, not military, solution to the crisis. In the aftermath of this crisis, Libya struggled with establishing an effective government. Elections for the General National Congress (GNC) were held in July 2012, and the NTC transferred power to it one month later. In March 2014, the General National Congress voted to replace itself with a new legislature named the Council of Deputies. Elections were held three months later with low turnout. The Council of Deputies took up residence in Tobruk and is the internationally recognized government of Libya. Former GNC and Islamist parties fared poorly in the elections and set up a rival government in Tripoli. Militias that fought against the Gaddafi regime vied for power in post-Gaddafi Libya, with violence beginning in 2011. By 2013, Libya became a failed state and was in a near-anarchic situation. Violence escalated in 2014, eventually  "
465,Cote d’Ivoire Presidential Crisis,"Background: An international crisis in Cote d’Ivoire related to the Second Ivorian Civil War began on 3 April 2011 and lasted until 11 April 2011. Cote d’Ivoire was the only crisis actor. France was also involved in the crisis. A civil war was fought in Cote d’Ivoire from 2002 to 2004 between the regime of President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel forces representing Muslim northerners, who felt that they were being discriminated against by the politically dominant and mostly Christian southerners. In 2002, France sent a large contingent of troops to Cote d’Ivoire as the Operation Unicorn peacekeeping force. In February 2004, the United Nations established the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to facilitate the implementation of peace agreements. PRE-CRISIS: A presidential crisis began in Cote d’Ivoire in early December 2010 when the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, disputed the results of the presidential election held the previous month, in which challenger Alassane Ouattara claimed victory. The Ivorian Constitutional Council supported Gbagbo’s claim, while the Ivorian Independent Elections Commission (CEI) and the majority of the international community supported Ouattara’s claim. A series of protests followed, eventually escalating to the Second Ivorian Civil War. Gbagbo’s control of the country's armed forces and the state media gradually crumbled under the weight of international sanctions and massive defections from the armed forces due to a successful military campaign by pro-Ouattara rebel forces. On 18 December, Gbagbo ordered peacekeeping forces from the United Nations and France to leave the country. The violence escalated in March 2011. On 10 March, Gbagbo banned French and UN aircraft from Ivorian airspace, but the UN continued to fly helicopters despite the order. On 30 March, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1975, calling for Gbagbo to step down, placing sanctions on Gbagbo and his associates, reaffirming the mandate of UNOCI to use all means necessary to protect civilians, and supporting Ouattara as President of Côte d’Ivoire. The resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria and France. French and UN forces began actively supporting pro-Ouattara forces. On 31 March, pro-Ouattara forces advanced on Abidjan from several directions. UNOCI said its headquarters were fired on by Gbabgo's special forces that day, and it returned fire in response. UNOCI took control of the Abidjan airport when Gbagbo's forces abandoned it. On 2 April, heavy fighting was reported around the Agban military base and the presidential palace. ","Summary: On 3 April 2011, French forces took direct action in the conflict by taking control of, and reopening, the Abidjan airport. This made it clear to the Gbagbo regime that France was a direct threat to its survival and triggered a crisis for Cote d’Ivoire. Hundreds of additional French troops landed in the Abidjan airport that same day. Cote d’Ivoire implemented its major response the next day: Gbagbo issued a vehement condemnation of France, calling it an “ugly colonist” that was planning a “Rwanda-style genocide,” and according to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon, pro-Gbagbo forces attacked UN forces and headquarters in Abidjan. UN and French helicopters began firing on pro-Gbagbo military targets that day. On 5 April, pro-Ouattara forces announced that they had captured the presidential palace. On the same day, Gbagbo’s military chief called for a ceasefire. Following this, it was reported that fighting had ceased in Abidjan. That same day, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) promised a “safe and dignified” exit for Gbagbo and his family if he conceded the election and handed power over to Ouattara. However, negotiations failed and forces loyal to Ouattara moved to seize Gbagbo at his residence in Abidjan on 6 April. Within the next few days, pro-Gbagbo forces retaliated in Abidjan and took control of the Plateau and Cocody areas of the city. On 9 April, pro-Gbagbo forces fired on the Golf Hotel, where Ouattara was located. UN peacekeepers, mandated to protect Ouattara and other civilians, returned fire. Pro-Gbagbo forces also fired on other civilians and the UN base. In response to this series of events, UN and French forces carried out further air strikes the following day against Gbagbo's residence and the heavy weaponry of his supporting forces. The crisis terminated on 11 April 2011, when pro-Ouattara forces, supported by French forces, captured Gbagbo without harm. The actual capture was made by Ouattara's troops, but French forces assisted in the final assault with tanks and helicopters, the latter delivering rocket strikes. Ouattara became the undisputed President of Cote d’Ivoire. Following his arrest, Gbagbo and members of his family and entourage were placed under UN police guard at the Golf Hotel. Gbagbo was then extradited to the International Criminal Court. Both during and before the crisis, the AU and ECOWAS called on Gbagbo to step down and affirmed their view of Ouattara as the legitimate president of Cote d’Ivoire. "
466,Sudan-South Sudan,"Background: Tensions between the government of Sudan and southern Sudanese had existed since the time of Sudanese independence and focused on resources, religion, and the right to self-rule. A separatist movement emerged in southern Sudan in 1955, and tensions eventually escalated into a civil war between the Sudanese government and southern rebels. The Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972 ended the civil war and granted significant autonomy to southern Sudan. However, the Sudanese government canceled these arrangements, and a second civil war began in 1983 that was led by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), a southern rebel group. Negotiations on the status of southern Sudan were abandoned when Omar al-Bashir took over in a military coup in 1989. The second civil war ended with the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and SPLM/A. This granted significant autonomy to southern Sudan and created a six-year interim period, at the end of which the South would be able to vote on secession via referendum. In March 2005, the United Nation Security Council established the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) peacekeeping mission, which was tasked with helping the parties implement the CPA. In 2009, the African Union HighLevel Implementation Panel (AUHIP) was established with a broad mandate to promote the resolution of conflict and democratization in Sudan, headed by former South African president Thabo Mbkei. PRE-CRISIS: On 9 January 2011, the people of southern Sudan voted for the creation of an independent South Sudan. Independence was set to go into effect on 9 July. The CPA also granted the people of Abyei, a disputed region claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan (Khartoum), the right to vote in this process in a separate referendum. The AUHIP tried to mediate the modalities of a referendum in Abyei but was unable to do so over disagreements about who counted as a registered voter in the region. In the following several months, a low-level rebellion against Sudan (Khartoum) began in Abyei. These rebels were supported by South Sudan. The unresolved status of Abyei became the most important source of continued conflict between southern and northern Sudan that did not end once South Sudan became an independent state. ","Summary: On 19 May 2011, a crisis began when several Sudanese troops taking part in a joint patrol in the disputed region of Abyei were killed in clashes with South Sudanese-aligned rebels. This triggered a crisis for Sudan. The most important part of Sudan’s major response occurred on 22 May, when it seized nearly the entirety of the Abyei region. This triggered a crisis for South Sudan, which was not yet an independent state. The most important part of South Sudan’s major response was to send its Vice President to Khartoum to negotiate on May 26. South Sudan also appealed to the international community to get Sudan out of Abyei, while it and South Sudanesealigned rebels in the region continued to clash with Sudan. However, Sudanese troops remained in place. On 1 June, Sudan attempted to disarm all armed groups operating in Abyei, an act which constituted the remainder of Sudan’s major response to its perceived crisis trigger.  With the initial outbreak of crisis and hostilities, there was a flurry of mediation activity by the AUHIP, a continuation of the effort that it began prior to crisis outbreak. The United Nations also tried to get involved as a peacemaker in late May but was rebuffed by Sudan. Around this time, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon proposed a new peacekeeping mission to replace (UNMIS). After a month of escalating tensions, the African Union on 20 June managed to mediate an agreement in which both parties agreed to allow a new UN mission to monitor Abeyi. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi played a lead role in securing the agreement, including offering to supply peacekeepers for the proposed UN force. South Sudan officially became an independent state on 9 July. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as the United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNIFSA), was deployed later that same month. Ethiopian peacekeepers comprised the entirety of UNIFSA in its early stages. Tensions between Sudan and South Sudan decreased slightly for several months, though they remained at crisis level. Renewed fighting occurred in December 2011 with airstrikes conducted by Sudan. Sudan also imposed an embargo on South Sudanese oil transiting its territory. Fighting continued throughout 2012. The most severe fighting occurred near Heglig, a town in the Sudanese state of South Kordofan, in which Sudan managed to stall a large South Sudanese offensive aimed at capturing the town. In the meantime, negotiations continued with little progress. The AU Peace and Security Council gave the two sides a deadline of 2 August 2012 to reach an agreement and threatened that it would adopt a “final” proposal on the Abyei dispute and refer the issue to the UN Security Council if a deal was not reached by then. The deadline passed without an agreement. The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan met in Addis Abba under the auspices of the AU in early September, with the Mbeki-led AUHIP urging both of them to adopt previous frameworks to resolve the dispute. The AUHIP tried to get a deal on the status of Abyei, offering proposals for resolution that included a referendum. The AU Peace and Security Council even adopted another deadline of 22 September for the two sides to reach agreement, but it was not met as well. Sudan was steadfast in its determination to not allow a final resolution of the status of Abyei to occur or to promise a referendum without first getting guarantees that nomadic groups that pass through the region would also be included in the referendum. Recognizing that negotiations would likely fail if the focus remained on Abyei, the AUHIP shifted the discussions to peripheral issues such as oil and demilitarization of the two sides’ common border—issues on which they had reached agreement earlier in the crisis but had not followed through on implementation. An agreement on these peripheral issues was eventually reached on 27 September, mediated by the AUHIP. This terminated the crisis for both Sudan and South Sudan. The agreement did not resolve the status of Abyei, leaving the area still technically part of Sudanese territory but mostly unoccupied, with the exception of a marginal presence of Sudanese military “police.” By helping to bring about the final agreement that terminated the crisis, the AUHIP’s mediation effort had a minor positive effect on crisis abatement, particularly through its facilitative tactics  of bringing the parties together to talk. In addition to its role as a mediator, the AU adopted numerous resolutions demanding a cessation of hostilities during the crisis. The UN, United States, and European Union also made statements demanding that both sides end the fighting, allow humanitarian access to the region, and resolve the Abyei dispute. None of these statements had a discernible impact on the crisis proceedings. Intermittent clashes continued after the crisis terminated. The Mbeki-led AUHIP mediation effort aimed at resolving the Abyei issue continued as well. "
467,Scarborough Shoal,"Background: The Philippines experienced a crisis with China over a standoff around the disputed Scarborough Shoal between 10 April 2012 and 15 June 2012. The Philippines was the only crisis actor, but China was also heavily involved as a disputant during the crisis. In addition, the United States played a significant role as a mediator. The Philippines and China have a long-running dispute over the status of the Scarborough Shoal and its surrounding waters. The status of the shoal is part of a larger regional dispute – also involving Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia – over various islands and waters in the South China Sea, a dispute that has escalated in recent years due in large part to increasing Chinese assertiveness regarding its sovereign claims. The dispute between the Philippines and China has been especially and persistently salient since 1995, when Chinese forces occupied Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands (see Case #414). Taiwan (Republic of China) also makes sovereign claims to the area around the Scarborough Shoal, but the Philippines and China have been the primary adversaries in the dispute over the shoal in recent years. Both China and the Philippines claim that the Scarborough Shoal is an integral part of their national territory. China refers to the shoal as Huangyan Island, claiming that it has “indisputable sovereignty” over the shoal and adjacent waters. The Philippines argues that Scarborough Shoal, which it refers to as Panatag Shoal, falls within its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and that the Philippines' sovereignty covers the rest of the resources within the EEZ and continental shelf. PRE-CRISIS: On 8 April 2012, a Philippine Air Force (PAF) reconnaissance plane spotted eight Chinese fishing vessels in the disputed waters around the Scarborough Shoal. In response, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to step up its monitoring activities in line with its enforcement of the country’s fisheries and maritime environmental protections laws. That same day, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, a Philippine warship, was dispatched to the Scarborough Shoal. On 10 April, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar arrived in the area. Philippine sailors boarded the Chinese fishing vessels for an inspection and discovered that the vessels were conducting illegal fishing. The Philippine sailors then attempted to apprehend the crew of the fishing vessels. ","Summary: On 10 April, following the Philippine Navy’s boarding of the Chinese fishing vessels earlier in the day, two Chinese maritime surveillance ships arrived at the Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese surveillance ships placed themselves between the Chinese fishing vessels and the Philippine warship to protect the fishing vessels and prevent their crew from being arrested by the Philippine Navy. This triggered a crisis for the Philippines and a standoff between the two countries at the Scarborough Shoal. On 11 April, in an effort to lower the tension generated by the standoff, Philippine President Aquino decided to withdraw the BRP Gregorio del Pilar and replace it with a smaller coast  guard vessel. This constituted the Philippines’ major response to the crisis trigger. That same day, the Chinese foreign ministry announced that the Philippines’ attempt to carry out law enforcement activities had infringed upon China’s sovereignty. China also warned the Philippines “not to complicate and escalate the situation.” and urged it “to stop illegal activities” and leave the shoal. The following day, the Philippines coast guard vessel arrived to take the place of the BRP Gregorio del Pilar. On 17 April, the Philippines urged China to bring the dispute to the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). The Chinese foreign ministry rejected Manila’s proposal and instead insisted on bilateral diplomatic talks to solve the standoff. By the end of April, both sides admitted that their negotiations were deadlocked. The Chinese Embassy blamed Manila for the impasse and “for negotiating in bad faith by distorting the facts surrounding the standoff.” On 9 May, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying summoned the charge d’affaires at the Philippine Embassy in Beijing and warned the Philippine diplomat that China was finding it difficult to be optimistic about the situation because of the Philippines’ refusal to withdraw its coast guard vessels from the shoal. The following day, the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision announced that fruits from the Philippines were being held for quarantine concerns. Also, the China International Travel Service suspended all scheduled flights to the Philippines. On 13 May, in a surprise move, the US submarine USS North Carolina arrived at Subic Bay. While the US and Philippines indicated that the submarine was conducting a routine courtesy visit, it was interpreted as a move signaling to Beijing the strength of the defense commitment between the Philippines and the US. In mid-June, the US helped to broker an agreement between the Philippines and China following weeks of a backdoor mediation effort aimed at resolving the standoff. Conflicting reports exist as to when the mediation began, but it was either in May or early June. Kurt Campbell, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, was heavily involved in this mediation effort. Under the agreement, which contained concessions suggested by the US, China and the Philippines promised to withdraw their forces from the Scarborough Shoal until a deal over its ownership could be reached. On 15 June, Philippine President Aquino recalled all Philippine vessels from the shoal, terminating the crisis. US mediation contributed to the resolution of the crisis via the agreement with which the Philippines eventually complied, but the main reason that the Philippines withdrew its vessels was because of an upcoming typhoon. China did not perceive a crisis during the standoff over the Scarborough Shoal that lasted from April until June. It did not place its military on alert, and top political and military officials stressed a diplomatic approach to resolving the dispute. During the standoff, China attempted to protect its territorial sovereignty in an assertive manner while actively avoiding an escalation to military hostilities, sending maritime surveillance ships to deal with the standoff rather than naval vessels. Neither the United Nations nor any regional organizations were involved in the crisis. The Philippines asked ASEAN to get involved, and China and the Philippines met on the sideline of a 28-30 May ASEAN meeting and agreed to show restraint. But the issue was not discussed by ASEAN at that meeting, and ASEAN did not get involved in the crisis. China did not abide by the US-brokered agreement that occurred toward the end of the crisis, and it maintained its presence at the Scarborough Shoal after the Philippines had withdrawn. The typhoon forced China to retrieve its civilian fishing vessels that were near the shoal on 18 June, but the Chinese maritime surveillance ships stayed near the area. Moreover, by July, China constructed a rope barrier across the mouth of the shoal, blocking Philippine access to it. China also placed naval vessels nearby the shoal in order to prevent the Philippines from attempting to break the barrier, effectively militarizing its presence in the shoal. In addition, in June 2014, Fu Ying, who had reportedly negotiated the June 2012 agreement for China with US mediator Kurt Campbell, denied the very existence of a US-brokered agreement for both sides to leave the Scarborough Shoal. On 29 October 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued a ruling that it has jurisdiction in the dispute between the Philippines and China and will hold hearings on the matter. In doing so, the Hague rejected China’s case that its claims in the South China Sea are indisputable and based on historical rights rather than legal precedent. "
468,Syria-Turkey Border Incidents,"Background: Turkey experienced a crisis with Syria between 3 October and 4 December 2012 that was precipitated by spillover military action from the Syrian Civil War. Turkey was the only crisis actor, but Syria was also heavily involved as Turkey’s adversary during the crisis. The United States was also involved in a notable way due to military support of Turkey, its NATO ally. Although Turkey-Syria relations have historically been positive, tensions had escalated since the start of Syria’s civil war in 2011. Turkey denounced Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s handling of the uprising, and Syria accused Turkey of supporting Syrian rebels. On 22 June 2012, Syria shot down a Turkish Air Force jet near the Turkish-Syrian border. The Syrian military alleged the jet had violated Syrian airspace. However, the Turkish Prime Minister and other spokespersons did not confirm the allegation and emphasized that brief incursions into neighboring airspace by high-speed jets are routine occurrences. The Turkish and Syrian navies conducted a search for the Turkish airmen downed by the incident. In August 2012, Turkey began to hold high-level meetings with the United States on plans to replace the Syrian Government. ","Summary: On 3 October 2012, five Turkish civilians in the border town Akcakale were killed by mortar shells fired by Syrian government forces. This triggered a crisis for Turkey. Turkey’s major response consisted of at least twelve hours of cross-border artillery fire and a request of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) involvement in the crisis that same day, and the following day Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan requested and received approval from Turkey’s Parliament for additional cross-border raids. The US, NATO, and the UNSC quickly condemned Syria’s actions, but Erdogan criticized the UNSC for not doing more. Syria apologized over the incident, in part due to Russian pressure. But tensions between Turkey and Syria remained high. On 10 October, Turkey forced the landing of a passenger plane traveling from Moscow to Syria because the plane allegedly contained weapons. Russia denounced the move, and Syria responded by closing its airspace to Turkish planes on 13 October. Turkey retaliated in kind in the following days. Cross-border fire continued during the remainder of October and into November. As Syrian government and rebel forces battled for control of border towns, Turkey responded to any stray Syrian shelling with cross-border shelling of its own. Turkey refrained from any airstrikes, and casualties were low, although Ankara did send several fighter jets to the border on 8 November after Damascus launched an air attack against one of its own border towns. On 21 November, Turkey officially requested that NATO deploy Patriot missiles along the Turkey-Syria border. Turkey insisted that the missiles would be used for defense purposes only. NATO approved the request on 4 December, and the US agreed to send several of its own PatriotNATO and the US had an important effect on crisis abatement via the decision to send missiles to Turkey. The missiles were delivered to Turkey after the crisis terminated, in early 2013. The UN’s involvement was ineffective. missiles as part of the NATO response. Turkey’s crisis faded after NATO approved the request. "
469,North Korea Nuclear V,"Background: Another crisis in the protracted conflict over North Korea’s nuclear program occurred from 12 February until 14 August 2013. The first crisis in this protracted conflict occurred in 1993 and ended with North Korea and the United States signing an agreement under which the former promised to freeze its nuclear program (see case #408). Almost a decade passed until the next North Korean nuclear crisis occurred in 2002, when it was definitively concluded that North Korea had begun a secret enrichment program (see case #441). Since then North Korea has ramped up its nuclear production and testing, and crises in this protracted conflict have become much more frequent, with one occurring every three or four years (see cases #450 and #459). Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were the crisis actors in this fifth North Korean Nuclear crisis. These were the same four actors as in the previous crisis in this protracted conflict, which occurred in 2009 (case #459) and centered on the launch of a satellite and a nuclear test by North Korea. Separate from the issue of North Korea’s nuclear program, North Korea and South Korea had also experienced two crises in 2010 related to the sinking of the Cheonan vessel (case #461) and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (case #462). North Korea underwent a significant political change on 17 December 2011 when Kim Jong-il suddenly died. His son, Kim Jong-un, took over the North Korean Supreme Leader office shortly thereafter, on 24 December. Relations with the US and South Korea remained strained as the new North Korean leader went ahead with a series of long-range rocket tests in April and continued the same harsh rhetoric used by his father. PRE-CRISIS: In October 2012, North Korea announced that it had developed a missile capable of reaching the mainland US. In December, North Korea fired a long-range rocket to test space capabilities, drawing condemnation from the international community. In January 2013, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voted to adopt Resolution 2087, which increased sanctions on the North Korean regime for its missile tests. In response, North Korea announced that it would conduct another nuclear test and promised to continue the development of its long-range missile Program. ","Summary: On 12 February 2013 North Korea conducted a nuclear test, triggering a crisis for South Korea, the United States, and Japan. On that day, Japan called an emergency meeting of its security council and issued its major response, which consisted of public threats to impose a fresh round of unilateral sanctions on North Korea, and most importantly, the sending of planes to monitor radiation levels. Japan was particularly concerned with the nuclear issue and the related potential for an accident, having endured the Fukushima Power Plant nuclear disaster almost two years prior and having its airspace and nearby international waters repeatedly targeted by North Korean missile tests in recent times. Also on that day, the US was reportedly in close consultation with South Korea about security issues. On 13 February, South Korea implemented the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger by staging large-scale joint military drills with the United States. Some of these drills were regularly scheduled but others were conducted specifically in response to the crisis trigger. US participation in these drills involved troops it had already stationed in South Korea. The following day, South Korea conducted the remainder of its major response: it unveiled a new cruise missile which was capable of striking anywhere in North Korea, deployed destroyers and submarines off its eastern coast, and officially condemned the nuclear test via a parliamentary resolution and a statement from the defense minister. Shortly after the crisis began, discussions about further UNSC sanctions against North Korea commenced. The US and China took the lead in engineering these sanctions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe voiced his support for UN sanctions when he met with US President Obama on 22 February. South Korea also pushed for UN sanctions. On 7 March, with unanimous support of all members, the UNSC adopted Resolution 2094, ordering more sanctions against North Korea. This triggered a crisis for North Korea. Voting to adopt these sanctions was the most important part of the American major response to the crisis trigger. The day after the sanctions were ordered, North and South Korea exchanged the highest level of “hostile warnings” that they had in years. On 11 March, North Korea verbally nullified the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement between itself and South Korea. This move was North Korea’s major response to its crisis trigger. On 15 March, the US bolstered its ballistic missile protection system on the Pacific Coast. On 27 March, North Korea shut down lines of communication with South Korea. The next day, the US and South Korea flew bombers over the Korean peninsula in a yearly military exercise that had been regularly scheduled but that had been expanded into a much larger exercise in the aftermath of the nuclear test. On 2 April, North Korea threatened to restart the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. That same day, the US sent a missile defense system to Guam. On 5 April, North Korea advised countries to evacuate their embassies in Pyongyang. On 8 April, in what would become a major focus of the crisis, North Korea pulled its workers out of factories in the southern Kaesong Industrial Region, shutting the factories down. This was notable because the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is a joint venture between North and South Korea and one of the only mechanisms via which the two countries have cooperated during the 2000s. It also marked a turning point in the crisis, as the primary issue soon shifted from the nuclear test to economic concerns between the two Koreas related to the KIC and its operation. The following day, North Korea warned that it was on the brink of war. After this escalation, South Korea called for talks to defuse tensions on 11 April, but North Korea refused to participate. On 25 April, South Korea proposed talks once more and threatened to take a “grave measure” with regard to the KIC if North Korea did not agree to hold talks. The following day, North Korea rejected the proposal to hold talks again, and South Korea announced that it was pulling its remaining workers from the KIC. On 3 May, the final South Korean workers left the KIC, effectively closing the KIC (albeit unofficially) for the first time since it opened in 2003. On 18 May, North Korea launched a missile, raising tensions further.  On 25 May, China pressured North Korea to return to talks and cease escalation of the situation. On 6 June, North Korea announced that it would return to talks, and the following day it restored communications with South Korea. These initial plans to hold talks collapsed due to a disagreement between the two sides over the rank of negotiators. South Korea and North Korea eventually met on 7 July and came to an agreement on the principles of reopening the KIC. Negotiations continued, and on 28 July, South Korea pledged $7.3 million in humanitarian aid for North Korea and called for “one last round” of make-or-break talks. North Korea continued to drag its feet in these negotiations. On 7 August, the South Korean government began the process of reviewing insurance claims to South Korean businesses that lost revenue due to the closing of the KIC, which was seen as the first step toward officially closing the KIC. Within 90 minutes of South Korea announcing that it was conducting this review, North Korea declared that it was committed to reopening Kaesong and proposed another round of talks on the matter. North Korea was hurting economically from the closure of the KIC, to a much greater degree than South Korea, as well as from UN sanctions. Talks re-commenced soon thereafter and resulted in an agreement on the reopening of the KIC, signed by North and South Korea on 14 August. This marked an end to the heightened level of tensions and terminated the crisis for all parties. As part of this agreement North Korea agreed to allow foreign investors into the KIC and adhere to “international business standards” that included allowing Internet and mobile phone access for South Korean factory managers. The two sides also agreed to no more unilateral closures of the KIC and the setting up of a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies for losses incurred due to the closure of the KIC. The nuclear issue remained unresolved. Nevertheless, South Korea, the US, and Japan were satisfied to have relations between the two Koreas return to the status quo. The UN was involved in the crisis through the Security Council’s imposition of sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions initially escalated tensions between the actors but ultimately contributed somewhat to bringing North Korea to the table. Russia was minimally involved in the crisis: it condemned North Korea while also warning South Korea, the US, and Japan to not get involved. On 7 April 2013, Switzerland indicated that it had recently been in contact with North Korean authorities and made an offer to mediate. However, mediation did not occur. "
470,Syria Chemical Weapons,"Background: A crisis involving the United States and Syria occurred between 21 August and 21 September 2013 against the backdrop of the Syrian Civil War. Almost one year prior to the day that the crisis began – on 20 August 2012 – US President Barack Obama stated that chemical weapons use in the Syrian Civil War would be a “red line” for the US government that would change his calculus about US involvement in the war. The first allegations of chemical weapons usage in the war emerged in December 2012. Between that time and the outbreak of the crisis, both the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad and opposition forces alleged that the other had used chemical weapons in a number of different attacks. These alleged attacks were small scale, and the evidence regarding their occurrence was ambiguous. In March 2013, the Syrian government asked the United Nations to conduct an investigation into the use of chemical weapons by the opposition. At the same time, France and the United Kingdom asked the UN to conduct an investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria in general. In response to the invitation from the Syrian government, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon established a fact-finding mission on 21 March to investigate the allegations of chemical weapons usage. This mission, known as the UN Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, also involved representatives of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Health Organization (WHO). In April 2013, the White House indicated that US intelligence was assessing “with varying degrees of confidence” the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, but that the assessment was uncertain and that investigations were still ongoing. PRE-CRISIS: Inspectors from the UN Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic arrived in Syria on 18 August 2013, three days before the attack that triggered the crisis. ","Summary: On 21 August 2013, videos surfaced of a mass chemical weapons attack against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, perpetrated by the Syrian regime. This attack was distinguished from the alleged ones that came before it by its scale and its verifiability: thousands were affected, videos of the attack surfaced immediately, and there was consensus among international intelligence entities that the Assad regime was culpable. This triggered a crisis for the US, which was concerned about its status and influence in the region, given that this attack was the first undisputed case of chemical weapons usage by the Assad regime that occurred after Obama gave his “red line” speech a year earlier. The US was particularly concerned about the negative repercussions that not responding would have on countries like Syria and Iran, who might be more likely to challenge the US in the future. President Obama stated that “this is a big event, of grave concern,” and the Obama administration initiated the first part of its major response by starting to reach out to dozens of its international counterparts. France and the UK were particularly involved: France argued strongly for a military response and released a declassified intelligence report that helped build the case against Syria. The UK called an emergency meeting  of the UN Security Council (UNSC) on the day of the crisis trigger and initially moved to introduce a UNSC resolution authorizing the use of force, until the UK Parliament voted to not support such involvement. The UNSC met on 21 August, discussed the issue, and demanded further clarity about the incident. On 24 August, the US moved naval warships into the Mediterranean Sea in a show of force, the second part of its major response. This signaled to the Syrian regime that the US was serious about its threat of force and triggered a crisis for Syria. Syria’s major response occurred the following day and consisted of agreeing to allow UN inspectors access to the site of the alleged attack in order to investigate, as well as Assad vehemently denying that his government was responsible for the attack and blaming the Syrian rebels instead. The crisis continued to escalate, though, and on 28 August, President Obama announced that the U.S. had conclusive evidence of the Assad regime’s guilt. The following day, the UK released an intelligence report confirming Obama’s allegations. The US released its own declassified report on 30 August. Then, on 31 August, Obama announced that he would seek Congressional authorization for the use of force against Syria, the third and most important part of the US’ major response to the crisis trigger. On 1 September, the Arab League issued a resolution urging international action against the Syrian regime over its use of chemical weapons but stopping short of endorsing US military strikes. On 9 September, Russia announced a proposal to avoid further conflict: if Syria agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons and place them under international control, the US would forgo a military strike. The US agreed to consider the proposal, and so did Syria. Over the next several days, the US and Russia worked together to draft a full proposal, and Obama postponed any Congressional vote on the authorization of force. Russia and the US announced a finalized plan to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles, known as the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons, on 14 September. On 21 September, Syria started to comply with the US-Russian Framework by submitting a declaration of its chemical weapons stockpiles and agreeing to give them up. This terminated the crisis for both sides. Throughout the crisis, the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) was the most involved of all UN bodies. The UNSG conducted a fact finding mission that helped put international pressure on the Syrian government, and in doing so the UNSG played a minor positive role in helping to abate the crisis. During the crisis, the UNSC was restricted to holding several emergency meetings, working toward a resolution, and issuing two statements, including a UNSC Presidential statement condemning the chemical weapons attack. The UNSC worked hard to come up with a resolution during the crisis but was unable to reach agreement and issue one until after the crisis had terminated. Russia opposed a proposed US military strike, blamed Syrian rebels for the Ghouta attack, and claimed that the evidence implicating the Assad regime was fabricated. But it nevertheless played an important role in helping to deescalate the crisis by working with the US to reach the Framework agreement with which Syria ultimately complied. The Arab League and NATO  condemned the chemical weapons attack and spoke with US Secretary of State John Kerry about the situation, and the Arab League also issued a call for international action against the Syrian regime. Neither of these organizations’ involvement had much effect on the crisis proceedings. The OPCW was heavily involved working before and during the crisis as a constituent part of the UN fact-finding mission, as well as after the crisis in terms of setting guidelines for the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons and monitoring the weapons destruction process alongside the UN. One week after the crisis terminated, on 27 September, the Executive Council of the OPCW adopted and added further benchmarks and timelines to the US-Russian Framework agreement. Later that same day, the UNSC issued a resolution endorsing a timeline for destroying Syria's chemical weapons and indicating that if Syria failed to comply, the UNSC would debate and seek agreement on a follow-up resolution spelling out punitive measures, including the possibility of Chapter VII measures. The resolution legally bound Syria to the plan approved by the OPCW and essentially implemented the US-Russia Framework agreement. According to the UNSC resolution, Syria had until mid-2014 to eliminate its chemical weapons. In mid-2014, the OPCW indicated that the destruction of these weapons was largely on schedule despite some hiccups. In July 2015, the OPCW reported successful destruction of over 90% of the weapons that were supposed to have been eliminated. However, accusations emerged that Assad has used chlorine gas in several attacks during 2015. Chlorine gas was not included in the UNSC resolution or OPCW plan, but it is on the Chemical Weapons Convention banned list. "
471,Crimea-Donbass,"Background:A crisis occurred between Russia and Ukraine from 22 February 2014 to 18 February 2015. The crisis had important and broad implications for Russian relations with Ukraine, other former Soviet states in the region, and members of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including the United States. PRE-CRISIS:On 21 November 2013, Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych sparked a wave of anti-government unrest  commonly known as Euromaidan  when he rejected a trade and political association agreement with the EU in favor of forging closer ties to Russia. Demonstrations in favor of closer European integration began in Kiev that evening and were initially peaceful, but they eventually spread to other parts of Ukraine and escalated into a series of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as demands for the resignation of Yanukovych. Violence between protestors and police reached its peak in mid-February 2014, when both sides were firing at each other and the number of deaths increased significantly. Alarmed by the escalating use of repression by the Ukrainian government, the United States imposed visa bans on twenty senior Ukrainian governmental officials on 19 February. The EU followed suit the next day with its own package of sanctions that included travel bans and asset freezes targeted at Ukrainian officials as well as a ban on the export of equipment that could be used for repression by the Ukrainian government. Over the next several days, a number of MPs from the ruling party in Ukraine (the Party of Regions), the armed forces, and police resigned and/or defected to the opposition or fled to safe areas. Faced with a Ukrainian Parliament that was now dominated by the political opposition, Yanukovych was pressured into signing an EU-mediated agreement on 21 February to try and end the political and civil crisis in Ukraine. This diplomatic move was all for naught, as Yanukovych fled Kiev for eastern Ukraine later that night, and Parliament voted to remove him from office the following day. The opposition took over the Ukrainian government, and Maidan protestors captured the presidential palace and took control of Kiev.      ","Summary:The removal of Yanukovych on 22 February 2014 sparked a crisis for Russia. Russia feared that Ukraine would leave its sphere of influence and become a NATO ally. Russia also expressed concerns about the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine, particularly in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Crimea, where pro-Moscow protesters were calling for Crimea to secede from Ukraine.Russian officials met the night of 22 February and into the morning of February 23, when it was decided that Crimea should be retaken and Yanukovych should be extracted from Ukraine. This constituted Russias major response to its crisis. Yanukovych showed up in Moscow on 26 February after leaving Ukraine with Russian assistance. On 27-28 February, unidentified soldiers (widely suspected, and later confirmed to have been Russian special forces) seized several government buildings and airports in Crimea, sparking a crisis for Ukraine. Ukraines major response to its crisis was verbal and began on 27 February, when it sent a note to Russia demanding that Russian troops stay on base in Crimea, called for calm, and discussed the situation with Russia. The following day, Ukraine called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the final part of its major response.On 1 March, the Russian Parliament gave President Vladimir Putin permission to use force in Crimea, and Russia launched a full-scale military intervention in the country that day. The move was met with little resistance from Ukraine, which was advised by the U.S. to avoid a military confrontation with Russia. Crimea was formally annexed on 18 March, following a local referendum two days earlier in which 97% of voters supported joining Russia. Non-violent military confrontations in Crimea continued until 25 March, when Ukraine withdrew completely from the region. In the meantime, tensions also began to simmer between Ukraine and Russia in eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian protests in the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass region in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Crimea was annexed. At some point soon thereafter, Russia began to conduct military exercises in Rostov and other points near its border with eastern Ukraine, and it also began massing troops in the area, all with the intent to try and force Ukraine to back down in Donbass without having to resort to violence. Ukraine beefed up security at border checkpoints, citing fears that Russian troops may invade. Russia removed some of its forces from Rostov on 31 March after a conversation between the U.S. and Russian foreign ministers.Pro-Russian militants in Donbass took control of several government buildings on April 7 and later declared independence from Ukraine  in the form of the Donetsk Peoples Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk Peoples Republic (LPR)  following referenda. This set off a war between Ukrainian security forces and pro-Russian militias in Donbass, supported by Russian arms and widely suspected to have included Russian military members.Ukraine responded to the initial events in Donbass with force. On 14 April, acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov announced an anti-terror operation against pro-Russian separatists, although it was short-lived. On 22 April, Turchynov ordered more military operations against pro-Russian militants. Despite publicly denying an interest in intervening in Donbass, Russia increased its troop presence along Ukraines southeastern border and began another series of military exercises on 23 April, raising concerns that it might conduct a full-fledged military intervention in Donbass if Ukraine appeared to be winning the conflict. Russia and Ukraine were involved in a simultaneous dispute over the latters natural gas debt to the former. Gazprom, one of Russias largest oil companies, was demanding advance payments for natural gas until Ukraine paid off its debts. Ukraine perceived this as a Russian political maneuver related to the larger security and territorial issues at stake in the crisis. In May, the European Union (EU) Energy Commissioner began talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to sort out a repayment plan that would keep the gas from being cut off. The Ukrainian pipelines also supply Europe, so there was a shared interest in resolving the debt dispute. On 15 June, talks over Ukraines natural gas debt broke down.  Russia cut the natural gas pipeline to Ukraine the following day. This move placed additional time pressure on Ukraine to resolve the crisis sooner.On 17 July, pro-Russian militants mistakenly shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a passenger plane that was flying over Donbass, with a Russian-made Buk anti-aircraft missile. The incident garnered significant international media attention and engendered widespread condemnation and outrage but did not slow the pace of fighting in the region. In August, after a Ukrainian counter-offensive regained control of several cities and villages in Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian troops intervened openly in the conflict, sending tanks and missiles across the Ukrainian border.The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) established a Trilateral Contact Group with Ukraine and Russia in June, initiating a mediation effort between the two sides. Separatist leaders from the DPR and LPR were also brought into the process. The OSCE brokered a ceasefire, the Minsk Protocol, between all sides on 5 September. The ceasefire failed to hold, and the fighting continued largely unabated through 2014, albeit at a lower level than before Minsk I. On 30 October, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a natural gas supply deal.Fighting escalated to pre-Minsk I levels again in January 2015. Pro-Russian rebels took control of the Donetsk airport on 15 January, signaling the full collapse of the Minsk Protocol. Around this time, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that he had no interest in peace talks and pledged to begin trying to move the front line.In February 2015, a renewed round of talks occurred, this time initiated and led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Merkel and Hollande mediated direct negotiations between Putin and new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, but also coordinated closely with the OSCE, which focused on renewed mediation efforts under the Trilateral Contact Group and securing the cooperation of the DPR and LPR. On 6 February, Merkel and Hollande met privately with Putin for several hours, convincing him to return to the table. The mediation effort officially began the following day, when Russian, Ukrainian, and separatist leaders met for negotiations hosted by the OSCE. France and Germany threatened new sanctions if a deal wasn't reached, and the OSCE promised to monitor the implementation of an agreement if one was reached. The mediation effort resulted in a second ceasefire agreement between all sides, commonly known as Minsk II, on 12 February. The ceasefire was scheduled to take effect on 15 February. Fighting mostly ceased after the signing of this agreement, but some clashes continued for a short time afterward in the city of Debaltseve, ending after rebels retook the city on 18 February. Russian military advisors coordinated the assault on Debaltseve, and U.S. sources were confident that the shelling and rocket attacks in the area came from the Russian military. Ukraines retreat from Debaltseve under fire terminated the crisis for both Ukraine and Russia. In response to the events in Crimea, the U.S. advised Ukraine to not engage Russia militarily but also imposed economic sanctions on Russia. The sanctions were widely viewed as ineffective. In addition, the U.S. provided funds, military training, and military equipment  not including weapons  to Ukraine during the crisis.The UN was involved in the crisis in several different capacities. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution condemning the Russian annexation of Crimea. The UNSC adopted a resolution on 21 July 2014 condemning the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight, and another resolution on 17 February 2015 endorsing Minsk II. The UNSC made several attempts to pass a resolution condemning the referendum in and annexation of Crimea, but Russia repeatedly vetoed those efforts. The UN was also involved in the areas of human rights and refugee assistance. UN activity had little effect on the crisis proceedings. Several regional organizations were involved in the crisis. In addition to its role as mediator, the OSCE deployed an observer group that monitored compliance with both Minsk ceasefire agreements and facilitated dialogue between local communities in eastern Ukraine, including between local residents and internally-displaced persons. In addition to its role in the natural gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia, the EU imposed several rounds of economic sanctions on Russia, first in March 2014 and then again in July and September 2014. The G8 suspended Russias membership on 24 March 2014. NATO became involved after Ukraine approached it shortly after Yanukovych was ousted. In February 2014, the secretary general of NATO reiterated the organization's commitment to a 2008 declaration endorsing a path to NATO membership for Ukraine, provided that Ukraine met certain criteria. On 1 April 2014, NATO suspended civil and military cooperation with Russia. NATO also participated in general capacity-building in Ukraine, issued statements on the situation in Ukraine, and conducted limited military exercises, generally viewed as a means of reassuring local allies. Russia accused NATO of being involved in a more substantial manner militarily, but there was no evidence to support that accusation, and NATO avoided direct military intervention. In the aftermath of the Minsk II, the situation in Donbass remained more or less stalemated, though all sides made some limited progress in complying and implementing the agreement during the remainder of 2015. The OSCE monitored the implementation of Minsk II."
472,Chinese Oil Rig,"Background:A crisis occurred between China and Vietnam from 2 May to 16 July 2014 over the placement of a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel Islands. The crisis occurred within the context of a long-standing dispute between Vietnam and China over competing claims to waters and various islands and reefs in the South China Sea (the two states previously fought a naval battle over the Spratly Islands in 1988; see Case #384).  It also occurred against a backdrop of increasing and broader regional tension due to Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea (e.g., the Philippines experienced a crisis with China two years earlier over the Scarborough Shoal; see Case #467).The Paracel Islands are located within Vietnams 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). China also claims historical sovereignty over the islands and its surrounding waters. China has administered the Paracel Islands exclusively since 1974, when it occupied the islands militarily. In 1996, China drew baselines around the Paracel Islands and two years later passed a law claiming a 200-mile EEZ from these baselines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Taiwan (Republic of China) also claims sovereignty over the Paracel Islands and surrounding areas.","Summary:On 2 May 2014, China deployed a state-owned oil rig  HD-981  roughly 17 nautical miles south of Triton Island, the southwestern-most island in the Paracel archipelago. This location was about 120 nautical miles east of Vietnams coast and 180 nautical miles south of Chinas Hainan Island. The oil rig was accompanied by Chinese Coast Guard ships and up to 80 Chinese commercial and fishing ships, which promptly created three security cordons, establishing a three-nautical-mile security radius around the rig  exceeding the 500 meter zone allowed for by UNCLOS. The deployment of the oil rig and accompanying ships triggered a crisis for Vietnam, which viewed the location of the rig as part of its EEZ. China claimed that the rig was in its own EEZ and announced that a drilling operation would occur from 4 May to 15 August 2014. Vietnams major response occurred on 2 May and consisted mainly of dispatching coast guard ships to the area. This triggered a crisis for China. Chinas major response occurred that same day, mainly via a notice from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese embassy, requesting removal of Vietnamese vessels from the area of the rigs operations. The remainder of Vietnams and Chinas major responses consisted of two meetings held that same day in which both sides reiterated their claim to the waters and no agreement was reached. On 4 May, after Vietnamese ships tried to break the security cordon, Chinese Coast Guard and Vietnamese ships rammed and shot water cannons at each other. Neither side backed down, and the standoff continued for two months, with intermittent clashes and intentional ship ramming. Several times during this period, Vietnamese ships approached Chinese ships and demanded that they leave, and Chinese ships chased the Vietnamese ships back to shore. On 3 June, China arrested six Vietnamese fishermen. At some point, Chinese PLAN (Peoples Liberation Army Navy) ships, along with fighter jets, helicopters, and reconnaissance aircraft, were deployed to patrol the area. The PLAN ships served as a protective ring around the Chinese vessels that were closer to the rig and interacting with the Vietnamese ships. The Vietnam Coast Guard also reported that China deployed anti-aircraft missiles to the oil rig.From 11 to 14 May, anti-Chinese protests occurred in Vietnam and resulted in at least two Chinese deaths and over 100 injured. Chinese factories were damaged. More than 3,000 Chinese nationals were evacuated from Vietnam from 17-19 May. China unexpectedly removed the oil rig on 16 July, one month earlier than originally planned.  China claimed that its exploration of the oil field was complete and that it would be making plans for its next actions, as per normal business operations. It also cited the approaching typhoon season as a reason for removing the oil rig earlier than expected. The removal of the rig concluded the crisis for both sides.Both sides filed multiple complaints with the UN Secretary-General (UNSG). In a 9 June appeal to the UNSG, China asked that its appeal be shared with the General Assembly. In response, the UNSG issued a statement on 11 June calling for action to resolve the dispute and offering to mediate via its good offices. This mediation offer was not accepted by either side. ASEAN made a statement on 10 May 2014 calling for full implementation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) between ASEAN and China, in order to build trust between the parties and prevent such disputes from escalating to violence again in the future. The statement appeared to imply that China bore the onus of responsibility for implementing the agreement, and China expressed concern over the statement.United States involvement in the crisis was limited to political statements, mostly condemning Chinas actions as provocative and destabilizing. Despite the removal of the rig, the overall issue of competing Chinese and Vietnamese claims to the area remained unresolved. The oil rig was moved in the direction of the contested waters again in late June 2015. In addition, Vietnam protested that the rig was in disputed waters in late January and again in early April 2016. In both cases, the rig was in overlapping claimed EEZs but closer to China than during the crisis."
473,India-Pakistan Border Firing,"Background:India and Pakistan experienced a crisis resulting from a series of escalating ceasefire violations along the Line of Control separating the Pakistani- and Indian-controlled portions of the Kashmir region. The crisis began on 6 October 2014, and faded sometime in the later part of that month. India and Pakistan have been involved in a protracted conflict, including several wars, over the disputed Kashmir region since 1947. In 2003, both states agreed to a ceasefire, though intermittent exchanges of fire continued. Relations between India and Pakistan experienced a brief thaw in early 2014, following the election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PRE-CRISIS:Tensions between the two countries increased in August 2014 after India canceled talks with Islamabad, citing objections to Pakistans meeting with Kashmiri separatists. Around the same time, exchanges of gun and mortar fire along the Line of Control began to escalate. These clashes escalated further beginning sometime during the first three days of October.","Summary:Escalating clashes along the Line of Control culminated in heightened attacks during the first night of the Muslim holiday of Ed al-Adha on 6 October 2014, triggering a crisis for both India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan both reported civilian casualties that day for the first time since violence began to increase in August, although there were conflicting reports of Pakistani civilian deaths a day earlier.Both sides initiated their major responses to the crisis on the same day as the crisis trigger. Indian troops retaliated with mortar fire. Pakistan also responded with violence, but its most important response consisted of the Pakistani foreign office lodging a protest through diplomatic channels that same day.Officials of the Directorates General of Military Operations (DGMOs) from Pakistan and India discussed the ceasefire violations via a hotline on 7 October, but failed to resolve the issue. The following day Pakistan implemented the final part of its major response to the trigger when it requested that the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) deploy to the area where the fighting was occurring. In response to this request, UNMOGIP sent observers to the Pakistani areas hit by shelling on 14 October.Each country issued public statements blaming the other for initiating the hostilities, and India charged that Pakistan was using gunfire to provide cover for Kashmiri militants crossing the border into India. Within each state, top officials met several times throughout the crisis. Both countries continued to exchange fire along the Line of Control and Working Boundaries through much of October. The violence that occurred during the crisis was described as the worst fighting since the 2003 ceasefire. Both sides crises gradually faded in late October to early November as violence and hostile rhetoric decreased significantly. Shelling and firing continued across the Line of Control even after the crisis faded and into 2015, but by that point the armed exchanges were at normal levels, with each tracking and condemning perceived ceasefire violations.Besides UNMOGIPs presence in the area, there was little external involvement in the crisis. Pakistan attempted to get the UN more involved, but India remained resistant to any efforts to internationalize the issue throughout the crisis. There was no mediation in the crisis. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement on October 9, urging both sides to resolve the issue through dialogue, but he also indicated that the UN would not intervene directly through its good offices to resolve the crisis. There was no regional organization activity in the crisis, and neither the United States nor Russia got involved.Violence between the two sides increased again in summer 2015. India and Pakistan renewed their commitment to the ceasefire in September of that year. This was followed by additional meetings and discussion between the two states, which had been off the table during the crisis and prior to the September 2015 ceasefire agreement."
475,Korean Land Mine,"Background:Another crisis in the extended protracted conflict between South Korea and North Korea began in early August 2015 with the explosion of a land mine on the southern side of the Military Demarcation line (MDL). The crisis ended on 25 August 2015. PRE-CRISIS:In the months leading up to the crisis, tension between North and South Korea began increasing due to military exercises conducted by both parties. In March 2015, North Korea conducted live-fire ballistic missile and surface-to-air missile exercises. At the same time, South Korea, conducted annual joint military training exercises with the United States, to which Kim Jong-un called for full combat readiness in response. In April and May, North Korea conducted a number of military tests, including test-fires of anti-ship and air defense missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and live-fire artillery exercises near the Northern Limit Line (NLL), while South Korea conducted live-fire missile exercises in the Sea of Japan and a two-day coast guard defense drill. On 20 May, North Korea announced the ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons. Shortly afterward, the U.S. and South Korea participated in two combined anti-submarine warfare drills and a joint military logistics exercise. On 3 June, South Korea tested a 500km range ballistic missile, capable of striking anywhere in North Korean territory. Tensions also spilled over into low-level confrontations between the two states. On 30 June, South Korea fired warning shots at a North Korean vessel that had crossed into international waters. On 11 July, approximately ten North Korean soldiers crossed the MDL, but returned north after South Korea fired warning shots.","Summary:On 4 August 2015, three land mines detonated south of the MDL, seriously injuring two South Korean soldiers. South Korean officials did not initially blame North Korea for the blasts, instead indicating that recent heavy rains may have caused mines planted long ago to shift. The following day, South Korea launched a joint investigation with the U.S. and the U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea into the incident. At some point over the next five days, the investigation discovered that North Korea was responsible for deliberately placing the mines and ruled out the possibility that the mines had drifted as a result of shifting soil due to storms. This triggered a crisis for South Korea. On 10 August, the investigation published its findings and charged the North Korean army with purposely placing the mines with the intention of killing South Korean soldiers. The investigation concluded that the mines were likely planted sometime after 22 July, which was the last time that South Korean patrols had gone through the gate near where the incident occurred. That same day, South Korea resumed the broadcasting of anti-North Korean propaganda over loudspeakers at the border. This constituted South Koreas major response to the crisis and in turn triggered a crisis for North Korea. On 11 August, Seoul demanded that Pyongyang apologize for the land mine incident and punish those responsible. On 14 August, North Korea denied planting the mines, and the following day threatened to use military strikes against the loudspeakers if the broadcasts were not stopped.  On 17 August, North Korea resumed propaganda broadcasting across the border via loudspeaker as well, which constituted its major response to the crisis. That same day, South Korea and the U.S. began another round of joint military exercises.On 20 August, there was an exchange of artillery fire between North and South Korea, after reports that North Korea had fired shells into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). There was no damage and no casualties were reported. North Korea denied   claims that it had fired the shells and reiterated its threat of military operations if the South Korean broadcasts did not stop. At this point, North Korean troops were ordered to a semi-wartime alert, and South Korea ordered the evacuation of over 10,000 citizens living close to the DMZ. On 22 August, North Korea deployed submarines and mobilized artillery units along the border. Despite this, North and South Korea agreed to emergency talks that same day, and the talks began later that evening. On 25 August, North and South Korea reached an agreement and released a joint statement wherein North Korea expressed regret over the soldiers injured by the mines and ended their state of semi-wartime alert, while South Korea ceased the anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts. This terminated the crisis for both sides.In addition to its role as part of the fact-finding mission, the U.S. released statements in support of South Korea and reiterating its commitment to South Koreas security and their alliance."
476,Turkey-Russia Jet Incident,"Background:Turkey, Russia, and several North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members experienced a crisis precipitated by Ankaras downing of a Russian Su-24 fighter jet that violated Turkish airspace on 24 November 2015. The crisis terminated on 29 June 2016. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, relations between Russia and NATO members were largely cordial, though not without incident. Minor tensions arose at various points during the 2000s due to NATO expansion, Russias invasion of Georgia, and potential United States anti-missile deployments in Europe. Russias bilateral relations with Turkey had grown relatively strong, with a robust trading partnership and bilateral agreements on issues ranging from visa-free travel to energy production and transport. Relations between Russia and the Turkey-NATO bloc soured beginning in 2011 as they took opposing positions in the Syrian civil war. The U.S., Turkey, and many NATO members began calling for Assads departure when he responded harshly to peaceful protests in 2011 and eventually began providing support to rebel groups fighting the regime. Russia strongly supported its long-standing ally and used its veto power to prevent any United Nations Security Council (UNSC) action against Damascus. In December 2012, NATO agreed to deploy Patriot missile systems along the Turkey-Syria border at Turkeys request, following a series of border incidents between the two states (see Case #468). The U.S. and Germany supplied the missile systems, which were scheduled to remain in Turkey for three years. Tensions between Moscow and the NATO bloc reached their highest point since the Cold War in early 2014 when Russia semi-covertly invaded the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine (see Case # 471). Russia also began testing NATO military preparedness by provocatively violating members airspace and territorial waters, particularly in Eastern and Northern Europe. The U.S. and a collection of countries, including many NATO members, began bombing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria in late summer 2014, around the same time that tensions began to rise in Europe. PRE-CRISIS:Russia joined the Syrian conflict on 30 September 2015, bombing both designated terrorist groups such as ISIL and Western-backed rebels in Syria. Although the U.S. and Russia claimed to be communicating to avoid any mishaps or misinterpretation of intentions in Syria, Russia violated Turkish airspace on several occasions. After several unproductive meetings with Russian officials about these violations and Russias bombing of ethnic Turkmen Syrians that were fighting Assad, Ankara determined that the threat posed by additional airspace violations required a strong response.","Summary: On 24 November 2015, a Russian Su-24 fighter jet violated Turkish airspace over the Hatay Province for a total of 17 seconds, triggering a crisis for Turkey. Turkish authorities attempted to warn the jet a total of ten times over five minutes prior to the violation without any response from the plane. Turkey deployed F-16 fighter jets and shot down the Russian plane, an act that doubled as Turkeys major response and the crisis trigger for Russia. Both pilots ejected and the jet crashed on the Syrian side of the border. One pilot was killed by anti-Assad militants and the other was recovered by Syrian and Russian special forces. A Russian helicopter was also shot down during the rescue mission, killing one Russian marine. Ankara stated it was defending its airspace and immediately contacted its NATO allies to discuss the incident and gain reassurances of support, and it also delivered a letter to the UNSC presenting its account of the events. That same day, Russia denied the plane ever received a warning and insisted it never entered Turkish airspace. Russia also promised significant consequences, which constituted the most important part of its major response to the crisis.The downing of the jet also initiated crises for several NATO membersthe U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Denmark. These five states had already committed or were soon to commit military personnel to direct involvement in the Syrian theater, and therefore feared that any escalation could draw them into potentially lethal conflict with Russia due to their Article V commitments of mutual defense. Their major responses occurred on 24 November. That day, NATO began a two-day emergency meeting at Ankaras request. The NATO Secretary General, U.S. President Obama, French President Hollande, German Chancellor Merkel, and U.K. Prime Minister Cameron all defended Turkeys right to defend its airspace, spoke with Turkish leaders, and called for calm and communication between Moscow and Ankara. NATO also stated that its members assessments supported Turkeys account of the jet downing incident.   On 25 November, Russia implemented the remainder of its major response: deploying air-defense assets (advanced S-400 missile systems to its air base in Syrias Latakia province and a warship to the eastern Mediterranean Sea), bombing Turkmen militias in northern Syria close to the site where the jet was downed in support of Kurdish fighters, breaking military ties with Ankara, cancelling a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and discouraging Russian citizens from traveling to Turkey. Despite the bevy of responses, Russia declared that same day that it had no intent of going to war with Turkey, thereby terminating Russias crisis.Tensions nonetheless continued to increase under an uncertain threat of Russian reprisal. On 28 November, Russia imposed sanctions targeting Turkish workers, goods, and tourism. That same day, Ankara announced the deployment of advanced jamming equipment to southern Turkey to counter the earlier deployment of Russian air-defense systems. Around this time, the leaders of some NATO states began individually discussing the situation with Putin. Hollande met with Russian President Putin on 26 November, primarily to discuss cooperation on countering ISIL, but he also called for de-escalation of the situation between Turkey and Russia. On the sidelines of the climate summit in Paris on 30 November, Obama and Merkel met with Putin to discuss the incident and other ongoing operations in Syria and Iraq. Cameron spoke with Putin on 9 December and agreed to provide U.K. assistance in analyzing the black box from the downed Su-24.   NATO held an important three-day Foreign Ministers meeting beginning on 30 November and decided to augment Turkeys maritime and air defenses. The U.S. agreed to keep the USS Donald Cookan anti-ballistic missile and air defense vesselin the region. Germany and Denmark each committed to deploying a naval ship to the eastern Mediterranean. Denmarks vessel was intended to counter the Russian S-400 system and to protect Turkey from any electronic intelligence gathering. Italy agreed to provide additional air-defense missile systems, and Spain agreed to extend the presence of its Patriot missile systems, which were already in Turkey as part of an earlier agreement. The German and Danish vessels arrived in the eastern Mediterranean later in December. Italy deployed the air-defense system to Turkey on 5 June 2016.On 13 December, Russia fired a warning shot at a Turkish vessel in the Aegean Sea, in what was widely regarded as retaliation for the downing of the Russian jet. In response, Turkey stated that its patience was limited and that Russia was overreacting, and it criticized Russia's military intervention in Syria. In mid and late December, hundreds of thousands of Turkish websites were hacked, forcing the government to temporarily block all foreign internet traffic to Turkish websites. There was some speculation that Russian hackers were responsible, but that allegation remains unproven. Controversy continues about the exact Russian role in the cyber attacks.On 18 December, the black box from the downed Su-24 was determined to be too damaged to provide any insight into the event. In a meeting that same day, NATO decided to further bolster Turkeys defense capabilities by agreeing to provide German-manned Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) to assist in monitoring Turkish airspace. Some NATO sources indicated the group intended these actions to not only secure Turkey, but also to restrain both Turkey and Russia. The U.S. and Germany withdrew their Patriot missile systems from the Turkish-Syria border on 22 December, per the agreement signed three years earlier. NATO deployed the promised AWACS system to Turkey and began monitoring Turkish airspace on 12 March 2016.Turkey alleged that a Russian (Su-34) plane violated Turkish airspace again on 29 January 2016, a claim supported by the U.S. and NATO. Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador and, along with NATO, publicly called for respect of borders. Russia denied that the incident occurred and alleged that there was no such thing as NATO airspace.Tensions rose again in February. In the first week of the month, Russia deployed its newest and most sophisticated aircraft, the SU-35 Flanker E, to its base in Syria. In mid-February, Turkey began shelling Kurdish positions on the Syrian side of the border and discussing a joint ground invasion in Syria with Saudi Arabia. This prompted Russia to request UNSC discussion of the shelling on 15 February and to submit a draft resolution to halt the shelling and Turkeys plans to launch a ground invasion on 19 February. The UNSC met on 16 and 19 February, but no agreement was reached; France, the U.K., and the U.S. were among those rejecting the Russian draft resolution.Press reports also began to appear in mid-February in which some NATO member government officialsespecially Luxembourg, Germany, and Francesaid that they were not interested in defending Turkey if it provoked a war with Russia. This occurred as ongoing U.S.-Russian negotiations aimed at establishing peace in the Syrian civil war began gaining steam. Turkey quickly indicated that it would not invade Syria without a U.S.-led coalition. The events of mid-February provided Ankara with a clear indication of the limits of NATOs willingness to support Turkey and constituted the termination of the crisis for the NATO members. Russian-Turkish tensions continued to simmer for the next four months. Then, on 27 June, Turkish President Erdogan sent a letter to Putin indicating his regret for the jet downing incident and informing him that the pilots of the F-16s involved in the shooting were being investigated. Two days later, Presidents Erdogan and Putin spoke on the phone for the first time since the incident. They expressed a determination to jointly fight terrorism and agreed to meet in person. After the talk, Russia lifted its sanctions targeting Turkeys tourist industry, and both parties planned to normalize trade relations and stated that this crisis chapter was closed. This terminated the crisis for Turkey, and the international crisis as a whole.The UN had limited involvement in the crisis. In addition to the UNSCs discussion of the situation, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement on 24 November calling for de-escalation and a thorough review of the incident.After the crisis terminated, Russia continued its military actions in Syria, including near the Turkish border, and its support for the Assad regime. Nevertheless, Russia and Turkey made further moves to restore their bilateral relationship. On 1 July, the two countries' foreign ministers met in Sochi and agreed to establish closer diplomatic contact and cease operations against all groups in Syria other than ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and al-Qaeda-aligned groups. Attempts to repair relations proceeded more rapidly after a July coup attempt against Erdogan. Some media sources indicated that Russia provided intelligence to Erdogan about the attempted coup. On 9 August, Erdogan and Putin met in person for the first time since the jet downing incident and stated that a consensus on normalizing ties had been established. The warming of relations between Russia and Turkey coincided with U.S. and European Union criticism of Erdogans crackdown on the Turkish opposition in the wake of the failed coup. NATO-Russia cooperation on destroying ISIL also continued after the crisis. "
