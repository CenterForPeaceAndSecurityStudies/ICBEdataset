Bolshevik Russia, precursor to the Soviet Union (USSR), experienced three international crises during its civil war (1918-20). One occurred in Transcaucasia before the end of World War I and is therefore excluded from the IBC data set. Another, from May 1918 to 1 April 1920, took place in Siberia (see Case #3--Russian Civil War II).  PRE-CRISIS The Communist regime, which had attained power in Russia on 7 November 1917, opted to withdraw from World War I through a separate peace with Germany--the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918. The Western Allies were anxious to maintain an eastern front against Germany and wished to prevent the Germans from seizing large stocks of arms in Vladivostok (the Far East) and Murmansk and Archangelsk (northern Russia). In pursuit of these goals the Allies attempted to use the 40,000 troops of the Czech. Legion then in Siberia. The Czech. Legion, an anomalous nonstate actor (NSA), refused to be disarmed by Bolshevik forces. Serious clashes between them ensued triggering a crisis for Russia in May 1918. Intermittent fighting lasted for almost two years: the Czech. Legion, fighting alongside the "Whites," acquired control of large parts of western Siberia and the Urals. However, the lack of sustained military support from the Allies led to the Czech. Legion's decision to evacuate Siberia on 1 April 1920 and to return to the recently created independent Czechoslovakia, thus ending the crisis.  Five state actors were highly involved in this crisis--Canada, France, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. All landed troops in Siberia. However, only the Czech. Legion fought against the Bolsheviks. As in Russian Civil War II (see Case #3), Russia was victorious by default because the Czech. Legion decided to disengage without achieving its--or the Allies'--principal objective.  The League of Nations, whose Council first met on 16 January 1920, was not involved in this crisis.
A two-stage crisis between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, arising from a military coup in the latter, lasted from 25 May 1918 until 3 September 1919.  PRE-CRISIS A military coup led by Federico Tinoco overthrew Costa Rica's president, Alfredo Gonzalez Flores, on 27 January 1917. U.S. policy, nonrecognition, and persistent opposition by supporters of the deposed president across the border in Nicaragua made it increasingly difficult for Tinoco to maintain control in Costa Rica. The movement of 500 Costa Rican troops to the Nicaraguan border on 25 May 1918, amid rumors of an imminent invasion of Costa Rica by pro-Gonzalez forces, triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. President Chamorro responded five days later by seeking U.S. advice and support and, in October, by attempting to forge a pact with Honduras designed to impose sanctions against Costa Rica and to assist Costa Rican rebels. On 4 November U.S. Secretary of State Lansing cautioned the presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras against supporting armed rebellion in Costa Rica. Nicaragua's crisis ended on 15 December 1918 when Chamorro informed its National Congress that Nicaragua was observing strict neutrality vis-à-vis Costa Rica.  Tension between the two Central American neighbors remained high due to continuing rumors of an anti-Tinoco invasion plan by rebel forces in Nicaragua, with aid from Honduras. President Tinoco communicated this perceived threat to the U.S. Consul--and chargé d'affaires--in Costa Rica, Chase, and to the American political leader, William Jennings Bryan, on 25 January 1919. This marked the onset of a crisis for Costa Rica.  Nicaragua accused Costa Rica of dispatching 5,000 troops to its border, a charge denied by Costa Rica's agent in Washington. On 30 April the U.S. minister in Nicaragua backed Nicaragua's charge in a report to Undersecretary of State Polk. Then on 6 May rebel forces under the command of Julio Acosta invaded Costa Rica and proclaimed a provisional government at Peña Blanca. Nicaragua denied Costa Rica's charge of direct involvement in the military hostilities and was backed by the U.S. Minister, Jefferson. But in June Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala recognized the Acosta regime. Despite his military victories, Tinoco fled Costa Rica on 12 August largely as a result of U.S. pressure. A new government formed by an associate of Tinoco collapsed on 3 September 1919, and the international crisis ended in Costa Rica's defeat.  The U.S. was highly involved throughout the crisis, mostly through political pressure on Tinoco to resign, but also more visibly through the landing of U.S. marines in Costa Rica in mid-June 1919, at the insistence of the U.S. consul and against the secretary of state's advice, to protect American citizens in Puerto Limón, Costa Rica. Honduras and Guatemala were also involved actors. (Acosta was elected President of Costa Rica on 9 December 1919, and his regime was accorded U.S. recognition in 1920.)  There was no global organization at the time of this crisis; and the Pan American Union, precursor to the Organization of American States (OAS), was not involved.
For much of the period of Russian Civil War I in Siberia, Bolshevik Russia experienced another crisis with the Western Allies, in the Arctic region from 23 June 1918 until 27 September 1919. Among the wartime Allies, Canada, France, and the U.K. reacted to revolutionary developments in the former czarist empire and in particular to the Brest-Litovsk treaty by landing troops in the two northern Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk beginning on 23 June 1918; the U.S. provided political support. This multistate intervention triggered a crisis for Communist Russia which, as in Russian Civil War I, perceived a grave threat to its political system. Russia responded almost at once, in serious clashes with British forces and the "Whites." Fighting continued intermittently for 15 months. The Allies had secured control over the regions around the two northern ports but did not attempt to march on St. Petersburg; and the Red Army lacked the power to push them into the sea. The military stalemate and the harsh Russian winter took their toll on the morale of Allied troops. Their evacuation was scheduled for the spring of 1919; but fighting continued through the summer. The withdrawal of Allied forces was completed on 27 September 1919, with Russia the victor by default, as in Russian Civil War I.  There was no global organization at the time of the termination of this crisis.
An international crisis between Russia and the Baltic states over the latter's assertion of independence occurred from 18 November 1918 to 11 August 1920.  BACKGROUND Of the three Baltic states Lithuania has a long history of independence and substantial power dating to its founding in 1316. At different times its territory included parts of Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, with suzerainty over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Bessarabia in southeastern Europe. Estonia, by contrast, was for most of its history under foreign control--by Denmark, the Teutonic Knights, and Sweden. Latvia, too, had never been independent before the twentieth century.  During World War I the Balts asserted their claim to independence on several occasions; but the tide of battle prevented its realization. From mid-July to mid-September 1915 the Central Powers stormed through Eastern Europe: czarist Russia suffered a series of severe military defeats leading to the loss of all of Lithuania (and Poland) and a million men.  PRE-CRISIS On 28 November 1917, taking advantage of the turmoil accompanying the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia three weeks earlier, the local Diet (legislature) in Tallinn proclaimed Estonia's independence. The new Soviet regime tried to reconquer a strategically important area but was blocked by the Germans. On 24 February 1918 Estonia again declared its independence--under German protection. Lithuania did the same on 16 February with the same outcome--an attempted Russian conquest and German occupation. Under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918 Russia was compelled to recognize the independence of its three Baltic provinces, along with Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, and Transcaucasia. In reality, they were under German occupation until the end of World War I. With the defeat of Germany and rampant civil war in Russia, the Balts pressed their claim to independence: Latvia on 18 November 1918; and Estonia the next day by reaffirming the authority of the Provisional Government initially formed in February 1918 under German tutelage. Lithuania, too, challenged Soviet power by forming the first of many short-lived national governments on 11 November. Those challenges to Russia's territorial integrity created a crisis for the new Soviet regime. It responded almost at once, invading Estonia on 22 November, Lithuania and Latvia in December, creating an existence crisis for all three newly established Baltic states.  Russia's initial advances were impressive: its forces occupied three-fourths of Estonia; almost all of Latvia including the capital, Riga, on 4 January; and half of Lithuania including the capital, Vilna (Vilnius), on the 5th. But its success was short-lived. Estonian resistance, supported by British naval and air power, drove the Russians out by February 1919 leaving the Estonian government in effective control of most of its territory. The Russians were compelled to withdraw from Latvia by a German-Latvian force in March with the approval of the Allies. And in Lithuania Vilna was lost to Poland in April; it was restored to Lithuania by the Allies in December 1919. The severity of violence did not exceed serious clashes.  High tension persisted until December 1919, when bilateral peace talks began between the adversaries. Separate peace treaties were concluded incorporating formal Russian recognition of independence for each Baltic state: the Treaty of Tartu (Dorpat) with Estonia on 2 February 1920; the Treaty of Moscow with Lithuania on 12 July 1920; and the Treaty of Riga with Latvia on 11 August 1920. Each marked the end of the foreign policy crisis for the concerned Baltic state. The last agreement ended Russia's crisis and the international crisis over Baltic independence as a whole.  The League of Nations, which came into existence seven months before the end of this crisis, was not involved.  (The three Baltic states were occupied by Soviet forces in September-October 1939 [see Case #75--Soviet Occupation: Baltic]. They were forcibly incorporated into the USSR on 21 July 1940. Soviet military bases were established in September and October 1940. Soviet control over the Baltic states was lost to Germany in 1941-42 and reacquired in September-October 1944. They reemerged as independent states with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.)
Czechoslovakia and Poland were enmeshed in a crisis over Teschen, also known as Austrian Silesia, from 15 January 1919 to 28 July 1920.  BACKGROUND The duchy of Teschen is a small territorial enclave between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Both newly independent states laid claim to it after World War I. Rich in coal and heavy industry, Teschen also possessed a railroad leading to Slovakia. Inhabited by a mixture of Czechs, Poles, and Germans, the duchy offered an ethnic basis for both claims.  PRE-CRISIS Polish and Czechoslovak national councils had been established in the disputed territory in October 1918. Warsaw had strengthened its influence by sending troops to the area. In November the two national councils agreed on their territorial jurisdiction, an agreement regarded as provisional by the Teschen Czechs. The Czechoslovak claim was supported by the U.K. and, especially, France. The U.S. and Italy backed Poland. In an attempt to present Prague with a fait accompli Warsaw announced on 15 January 1919 that elections would be held in Teschen later in the month for representatives to the Polish National Assembly. This triggered a crisis for Czechoslovakia, which feared that the election results would be interpreted by Warsaw as a popular wish to be part of Poland. Prague responded on 23 January, just three days before the elections, by dispatching troops to the district of Kewin, which was then administered by the Polish national council. That move triggered a crisis for Poland. A major battle was prevented only by the intervention of British and French officers.  Acting under the aegis of the victorious powers' Supreme Council (the Big Ten at the Paris Peace Conference), the Conference of Ambassadors produced a preliminary demarcation line in the duchy: Poland was to receive two-thirds of the territory including the principal town of Teschen, with the mining district, the railway station, and part of the railway allocated to Czechoslovakia. Warsaw accepted, but Prague refused. Serious clashes erupted in May 1919. The Supreme Council decided in favor of a plebiscite in September, but it was aborted. Clashes occurred again in March and May 1920. Finally, on 28 July, the Conference of Ambassadors secured the parties' agreement to a division of the disputed territory as set out above. This terminated the crisis over Teschen; but neither party was satisfied with the compromise then or later.  Although the League of Nations Council first met six months before the end of the Teschen crisis, the new global organization was not involved.
In one of several World War I "fall-out" crises Hungary experienced crisis and war with Czechoslovakia and Romania from 20 March to 3 August 1919.  PRE-CRISIS The primary foreign policy objective of the Western powers in the aftermath of World War I was to reverse the revolutionary tide in Russia. At the same time small powers in Central-Eastern Europe aimed at expanding their territory at the expense of successors to the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire. The new state of Hungary was at the crossroads of these two currents. Romania and Czechoslovakia were already violating the demarcation lines set by the 13 November 1918 Military Convention. France, concerned with strengthening Russia's western neighbors, tacitly encouraged the partition of Hungary. The Mihály Károlyi-led government in Budapest was not recognized by France, the U.K., or the U.S. International pressure on Hungary reached its peak on 20 March 1919 in the form of an ultimatum from the Supreme Council's delegate in Budapest, Lieutenant-Colonel Fernand Vix, to Károlyi: in accordance with a 26 February Paris Peace Conference decision the Hungarian government was instructed to accept the implementation of a neutral zone between Hungary and Romania. The ultimatum triggered a crisis for Hungary because of the following: it threatened the loss of extensive Hungarian territory, even more than indicated in the November 1918 Armistice; there was intense time pressure--30 hours--for acceptance; and because Vix, exceeding his orders, threatened military reprisals if the ultimatum were rejected. Károlyi responded to a perceived threat to Hungary's existence by rejecting the ultimatum and by resigning in favor of the pro-Soviet Socialist Béla Kun.  The ultimatum and the response increased the risk of war in Central Europe. There were, in fact, some clashes with the Czechoslovaks and the French, escalating to full-scale war on 16 April, when Romania invaded Hungary. Later that month Czechoslovakia attacked from the north. And the French were directly involved, occupying Hungarian towns in the south and, together with Italian military officers, advising the invading Czechoslovak troops. Hungary was able to resist and succeeded in launching a counteroffensive against the Czechoslovak forces on 11 May triggering a crisis for Prague. The Czechs were expelled from Hungarian territory; and Hungarian troops, with Polish military assistance, occupied part of Slovakia. At that point France intervened: on 8 and 15 June 1919 it sent two ultimatums to Budapest demanding its withdrawal from Slovakia. Hungary's government complied on the 16th thereby ending its brief crisis. Then on the 24th an armistice was signed between Hungary and Czechoslovakia ending the latter's crisis. Prague perceived the withdrawal of Hungarian troops as a victory.  War on Hungary's eastern front had receded, although the resumption of hostilities remained likely. And in fact Hungary launched an attack on 20 July triggering a crisis for Romania. Bucharest responded on the 24th with a counteroffensive, which quickly overcame Hungarian forces. And on 3 August Romanian troops occupied Budapest terminating this three-actor international crisis.  France, as noted, was very highly involved, the U.K. and the U.S. much less so. Russia provided statements of support to the communist regime in Hungary and relieved the pressure from Romania by diverting its attention to the northeast, sending an ultimatum on 1 May 1919, which triggered Romania's crisis over Bessarabia (see Case #10--Bessarabia).  There was no global organization at the time of this crisis.
Greece and Italy were directly engaged in a crisis over Anatolia from early March to 29 July 1919. Turkey's defeat in World War I accelerated the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. France and the U.K. had already laid claim to its non-Turkish territories (see below). Constantinople was controlled, de facto, by the British; the Ottoman government had lost all autonomy in foreign policy. The Greeks had invaded Eastern Thrace and had made no secret of their claims to western Anatolia, especially to Smyrna (Izmir) with its large Greek population. However, spheres of influence had already been drawn by the Allies in Anatolia and the Middle East in secret agreements during the war.  The Treaty of St. Jean de Maurienne (21 April 1917) had awarded Italy primacy in the Adalia Province of southern Anatolia and in western Anatolia including Smyrna--in return for Italy's recognition of the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 9 May 1916. That agreement had divided the Arab Near East lands of the Ottoman Empire into British and French spheres of influence--Palestine and Mesopotamia (Iraq) to the former, the coastal strip of Lebanon, Syria, Cilicia, and southern Kurdistan to the latter. Behind the scenes Britain's Prime Minister Lloyd George, a strong Hellenophile, was adamant about curtailing Italy's influence in the Near East. Acting under the terms of the Treaty of St. Jean de Maurienne, Italy began to occupy southern Anatolia in early March 1919. This triggered a crisis for Greece which, with the backing of the U.K. and France and, more quietly, the U.S., responded on 15 May 1919: 20,000 Greek troops landed in Smyrna. This triggered a crisis for Italy, which perceived a threat to its influence in the Near East. Minor clashes occurred in Smyrna between Greek and Turkish civilians and between Greek and Italian forces in the region.  Bilateral negotiations culminated in the Venizelos-Tittoni Agreement on 29 July 1919. Italy undertook to support Greece's claims in Thrace, northern Epirus, the Aegean Islands, and Smyrna. Greece, in turn, recognized Italian primacy in southwest Anatolia and pledged support for Italy's demands for a League of Nations Mandate over Albania. Moreover, Italy would retain Rhodes, and Greece received the Dodecanese Islands. This agreement ended the international crisis over Smyrna.  Although Greece achieved most of its territorial objectives, Greek/Turkish hostility, a constant in the eastern Mediterranean, was sharply intensified. (See Cases #16, #18, #25--Greece/Turkey War I, II, III, in 1920, 1921, 1922, in Multiregional PCs: Greece/Turkey.) Ottoman Turkey made the most concessions but did not experience a higher probability of war--with Greece or Italy--or time pressure. Thus Greece and Italy were the only crisis actors, with Turkey, the U.K., and France heavily involved in the Smyrna crisis.  There was no global organization at the time of this crisis.  (The terms of the Venizelos-Tittoni Agreement, along with those of Sykes-Picot, were later incorporated into the Treaty of Sèvres, 10 August 1920, between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire with some changes: a plebiscite was to be held in Smyrna and its hinterland after five years of Greek administration; and the Dodecanese Islands were given to Italy, the rest of the Aegean Islands to Greece. The Turks under Kemal Atatürk captured and largely destroyed Smyrna in September 1921 during the prolonged Greece/Turkey War [see Case #18--Greece/Turkey War II]. As a result Turkey regained control over all of Anatolia and recovered Eastern Thrace from Greece, in the Treaty of Lausanne, 24 July 1923, which replaced the Treaty of Sèvres.)
A crisis-war between Afghanistan and the U.K., acting through British India, lasted from 15 April until 8 August 1919. Modern Afghanistan emerged in 1747 as a loose union of previously autonomous tribes. From the outset its geography--a landlocked state in Central Asia between czarist Russia and British India--shaped its foreign policy. After a phase of expansion (1747-1800) and a period of foreign conflict, with Persia (Iran), the Sikh Empire in the Punjab, Russia, and India (1800-80), Afghanistan under Amir Abdur Rahman (1880-1901) accepted British tutelage in foreign affairs. This protectorate status continued under Amir Habibullah (1901-19), who tried, but failed, to secure London's acquiescence in full independence in return for Afghan neutrality during World War I. On 2 February 1919 Habibullah wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, seeking Afghan representation at the Paris Peace Conference and recognition of Afghanistan's "absolute liberty, freedom of action and perpetual independence." The negative response from Delhi contributed to his growing unpopularity, which led to his assassination on 19 February. In the struggle for succession his son Amir Amanullah assumed the throne. On 3 March he reiterated the demand for recognition of "our independent and free Government of Afghanistan," in a letter to the viceroy of India. He repeated this in a public proclamation a few days later and again on 13 April at a public darbar, or court reception, attended by the British agent in Kabul. The viceroy's reply to Amanullah's letter of 3 March, sent on 15 April, reaffirmed the protectorate status quo: "the alliance between the two Governments ... is based on the treaties and engagements" undertaken by his two predecessors. This rebuff initiated a crisis for Afghanistan. Amanullah responded at once by moving regular Afghan forces to the frontier with India: they arrived at the Khyber Pass on 2 May; and a skirmish with the Khyber Rifles occurred the next day. On the 4th Afghan troops cut the water supply to Landi Kotal, triggering a crisis for the U.K. Britain retaliated by closing the Khyber Pass. The viceroy wrote again on the 4th offering the amir an opportunity to disclaim responsibility for initiating hostilities, but it was too late. During 5-6 May Afghan forces occupied the towns of Kalat-I-Ghilzai and Khost. On the 9th British Indian forces counterattacked in the Khyber area.  Afghan forces suffered several setbacks during the next few weeks. As a result Amanullah sought negotiations for a cease-fire, which began in mid-June. Peace talks commenced in Rawalpindi, India, on 25 July. And a formal agreement was signed on 8 August 1919. Afghanistan's independence in foreign policy was acknowledged but the U.K.'s special status was reaffirmed. Thus ended the brief Third Afghan War and the international crisis for Afghanistan and the U.K.  (Formal recognition of complete Afghan independence from the British Empire was accorded at the Kabul Conference, which ended on 8 December 1921.) There was no global organization at the time of this crisis.
The first of several international crises between Russia and Finland since the end of World War I lasted from 20 April 1919 to 14 October 1920. On 20 April 1919 a "volunteer" force of Finnish soldiers, backed by the Finnish government, crossed into East Karelia and seized Olonets, triggering a crisis for Russia. Foreign Affairs Commissar Chicherin demanded an explanation. And several members of the Finnish Economic Commission in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) were arrested. Both Prime Minister Castren and Foreign Minister Enrooth denied any Finnish territorial designs on Olonets but reaffirmed Finland's military support for the "volunteers."  On 6 May Finland's independence was recognized by the U.K. and the U.S. Finnish and Russian batteries exchanged fire on 17 and 18 May. (It is unclear who fired the first shot.) This triggered a crisis for Finland and escalated Russia's crisis. Sporadic fighting continued through May. Chicherin sent several protest notes to Helsinki, notably a letter to his Finnish counterpart on 6 June declaring that Russia considered itself free to take "all necessary steps" to eliminate "Finnish aggression," further escalating Finland's crisis. In the fighting that followed, Finnish forces experienced several setbacks.  Peace talks began in September 1919; but Finland renewed its offensive into East Karelia in October. After months of hostilities, negotiations resumed in June 1920. And a peace agreement, the Treaty of Tartu (Dorpat), was signed on 14 October 1920 marking an end to this crisis over territory.  Four major powers were involved in this crisis. Germany was involved diplomatically. Activity by France and the U.S. was confined to statements in support of Finland. And the U.K., in addition to supportive statements, dispatched naval vessels to the Baltic at Finland's request in order to enhance its bargaining position in the negotiations.  Although the League of Nations Council first met nine months before the end of this crisis, the global organization was not involved.
The borderland of Bessarabia (Moldavia, later Moldova) was the focus of a crisis between Russia and Romania from 30 April 1919 to 2 March 1920. Bessarabia had a long history of foreign occupation, from the time the Bulgars, a Turkic people, settled there in 679 A.D.: the Mongols (1241); Lithuania (1396); Russia (1812); Turkey (1856); and Russia once more (1878).  The breakdown of law and order at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution led the provincial government in Bessarabia in late December 1917 to request both the Romanian government and the Russian army's GHQ to dispatch troops to the area. Romania did so; and its forces occupied Kishinev, capital of Bessarabia, on 13 January 1918. Bessarabia proclaimed its independence on 24 January, but it was not recognized by the powers.  Russia responded to Romania's military intervention by severing diplomatic relations with Bucharest on 13 January and insisting that Romanian troops be withdrawn from Bessarabia. Romania refused; and its military presence was backed by a Note in early February from the senior representatives of France, Greece, Italy, the U.K., and the U.S. to the Rumtcerod, or governing body in Odessa, as a measure designed to restore order; the question of sovereignty over Bessarabia was left open. Tension rose on 27 March and again on 9 April 1918, when the legislatures of Romania and Bessarabia passed an act of union. Chicherin, the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, protested to Bucharest on 27 March. (The events from 13 January to 27 March 1918 constitute a separate Russia/Romania crisis, but it is not treated as such here because it ended before November 1918, the onset of the ICB data set.) Tension between Romania and Soviet Russia remained high during the next 12 months. This was exacerbated by two acts of formal recognition: of the Bessarabia-Romania union by the Central Powers in the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918; and of the Bessarabia-Romania "confederation" by the Hetmanate, or governing body, of independent Ukraine in June 1919 after initial opposition. Persistent tension escalated to international crisis when Romania formalized the union with Bessarabia on 30 April 1919. Russia perceived a serious threat to territory that had been internationally recognized as part of Russia in 1812 and again in 1878. It responded on 1 May with an ultimatum from Chicherin and Rakovsky, Chairman of the Council of Commissars for Soviet Ukraine, which triggered a crisis for Romania: Bucharest was given 48 hours to evacuate Bessarabia, or the Soviet regimes would act as they saw fit. Russia followed this with a declaration of war against Romania on 18 May. Serious clashes occurred but there was no decisive outcome, for the Red Army, faced with civil war against the "Whites," was unable to mount a concerted offensive against Romanian troops in Bessarabia. The military stalemate led to bilateral talks in early February 1920, though Romania refused to discuss the union with Bessarabia. An armistice was signed on 2 March ending the Bessarabia crisis, though not the long-standing conflict. The outcome was a victory for Romania, a defeat for Russia.  The League of Nations, whose Council first met less than two months before the end of this crisis, was not involved.  (Negotiations on a settlement of the basic dispute over territory broke down at the end of October 1920 following recognition of the Bessarabia-Romania union by France, Italy, Japan, and the U.K. on 28 October--though this treaty was not ratified until 1924 by Britain and France, and 1927 by Italy. The USSR formally recognized the loss of Bessarabia to Romania on 9 June 1934. However, it was occupied by Soviet troops on 28 June 1940 in accord with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 dividing eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. After German occupation during World War II Bessarabia was reoccupied by Soviet forces in 1944 and was ceded by Romania in 1946. It remained part of the USSR until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it emerged as the independent state of Moldova.)
Turkey and France experienced a crisis-war in Anatolia from November 1919 to 20 October 1921. Secret agreements among the Great Powers during World War I had awarded France a sphere of influence in Cilicia, that is, southeastern Anatolia bordering on Syria (see Case #7). As with Italy in the Smyrna crisis, France began to occupy its assigned area in November 1919, taking control of the three main cities--Maras, Aintab, and Urfa. This triggered a crisis for the new nationalist regime in Turkey under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk).  (Atatürk had succeeded in forging a National Pact through the summer and autumn of 1919, notably at the Erzurum and Sivas congresses in July-August and September. By December 1919 nationalist forces controlled Ankara, the agreed-upon capital of a renascent Turkey, and had liberated large parts of Anatolia. The Sublime Porte, the government of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople, was reduced to an empty shell.)  Turkey responded to the French occupation in late January 1920, around the 20th, with an attack on French forces and their Armenian supporters in Maras, triggering a crisis for France. Hostilities escalated to full-scale war, and the French were evicted from Maras within three weeks. The parties agreed to a 20-day armistice on 23 May 1920; but the French broke the agreement on 10 June and opened another front in northern Anatolia.  British forces attempted to divert the Turkish nationalists by landing troops on the Anatolian coast off the Sea of Marmara. And Greece repeatedly attacked the Turks in 1920 and 1921 (see Cases #16 and #18, in Multiregional PCs: Greece/Turkey). Kemal Atatürk successfully resisted the Greek invasion and secured an agreement with Soviet Russia in December 1920 to relieve his eastern front.  As their military stalemate persisted, France and Turkey began secret negotiations in the summer of 1921. A formal agreement, the Ankara Accord, was voluntarily signed on 20 October 1921 ending the Cilician crisis-war: it had lasted almost two years and had been a considerable drain on French resources, in a region where French interests were secondary. France evacuated Cilicia and agreed to a special regime in Alexandretta, Syria, to safeguard the interests of the city's substantial Turkish population, in return for economic concessions, notably rights to sections of the Baghdad Railway.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.  (Following the end of the Cilician War, France and Turkey entered upon an era of cooperation, though they were later enmeshed in a prolonged crisis over Alexandretta, from 1936 to 1939 [see Case #53].)
France and Germany experienced a crisis over the Rhineland and the Ruhr from 3 April to 17 May 1920. In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in World War I the stability of the newly proclaimed Weimar Republic (November 1918) was undermined by several internal uprisings. The most serious was a promonarchist putsch in Berlin by Wilhelm Kapp in mid-March 1920. Although he held power for only four days, 13-17 March, this incident triggered widespread rebellion, especially a Spartacist (Communist) revolt in the Ruhr mining districts. Coping with these challenges was made more difficult by the Versailles Treaty requirement (Article 160) of a reduction of German armed forces to 100,000 by 31 March 1920, as well as by Article 43, which forbade German occupation of the Ruhr Neutral Zone.  In an attempt to suppress these rebellions the German government made two requests on 15 and 17 March for authority to send troops into the Ruhr. France refused. The U.K., backed by the other members of the Supreme Council at the Paris Peace Conference, Italy, Japan, and the U.S., took the position that it would be preferable to allow the Germans to crush the rebellions rather than to involve the Allies in German internal disputes. On the 20th, amplified on the 28th, France offered to accept the entry of German troops into the restricted zone if, as a quid pro quo, Allied troops occupied parts of Germany, to last as long as the German presence in the Ruhr. The U.K., perceiving this as a cover for long-term French occupation, disapproved, as did the Supreme Council. On 30 March Chancellor Müller informed the Reichstag that French consent to Germany's request had been granted and that 2 April had been set for the initial dispatch of troops to the Ruhr. On 31 March France withdrew its offer by making it conditional on approval by the Rhineland Commission. Despite British advice to Germany to delay implementation of its plan, forces of the Reichswehr entered the Ruhr Neutral Zone on 3 April and suppressed the Spartacist revolt with great severity. That act triggered a crisis for France, which perceived a threat to its influence in Western Europe generally and, in particular, the Franco/German border area. France responded on the 4th by placing its armed forces on alert and, more important, by occupying Frankfurt and Darmstadt on the 6th. That in turn triggered a crisis for Germany, which viewed France's unilateral act as a threat to its political regime.  Germany strongly opposed the French occupation of its territory, warning of "the gravest political and economic results." On the 8th the U.K. sent a sharp note to Paris condemning France's action, as well as boycotting the Conference of Ambassadors. This blunt criticism was elaborated two days later by a carrot-stick démarche from one ally to another: British Foreign Secretary Curzon told French Ambassador Cambon that, if France admitted it had erred in acting unilaterally and if it promised to refrain from such actions in the future, the U.K. would consider the matter "cleared up." Premier Millerand, who considered Anglo-French solidarity more important than the temporary presence of German troops in the Ruhr, gave the necessary assurances on 11 April, with a reciprocal German announcement the same day that all German forces in the Ruhr not required to put down the rebellion would be withdrawn immediately. Then on 24 April Germany informed France that its troops in the Ruhr were being withdrawn thereby terminating France's crisis. On the 26th, at the San Remo Conference, Millerand agreed to withdraw French forces as soon as German troops were evacuated. French (and supporting Belgian) troops began their withdrawal from Germany on 17 May ending Germany's crisis and the international crisis as a whole. In an infrequent crisis outcome both France and Germany perceived the outcome as a victory.  Belgium, as noted, was a highly involved actor. Italy, the U.S., and Japan were less involved, supporting the high-profile and active British posture on the optimal path to effective crisis management. The League of Nations declined a German request that it attempt to resolve the dispute. The League Council held its first meeting less than three months before the outbreak of this crisis and was not involved.
A crisis-war between Russia and Poland erupted on 25 April 1920 and lasted until 12 October. On 27 March 1920 the Poles demanded Russian acquiescence in the restoration of their border of 1772, with a plebiscite to be held in the region west of that boundary. Russia rejected the demand but made several attempts to find a compromise. The Poles were adamant. The result was full-scale war. On 25 April 1920, three days after securing a green light from "White" Russian commanders, Poland launched a major offensive toward the Ukraine triggering a crisis for Soviet Russia. Kiev was captured on 7 May. Russian forces regrouped and launched a counterattack in mid-May triggering a crisis for Poland. The latter was compelled to evacuate its Ukrainian-occupied territories, including Kiev, on 11 June. A major Russian offensive began in mid-July, assisted by a Russo-Lithuanian agreement on 12 July that allowed Russian troops to use Lithuanian territory to prosecute the war. (This was to trigger a separate crisis--see Case #17--Vilna I, in Lithuania/Poland PC.) The Poles were defeated near Vilna (Vilnius) on 15 July. The Russian advance penetrated deep into Polish territory, barely 20 miles from Warsaw on 14 August. Poland had appealed to the Allies earlier (7 July) for help and had obtained military aid from France including military advisers. By late August Polish forces turned the tide and expelled the Russians from ethnically Polish territory.  The two adversaries, exhausted by the war, agreed to an armistice on 18 September 1920. Peace talks began in Latvia's capital on 23 September and led to a preliminary agreement on 12 October ending the crises for Poland and Russia and the international crisis as a whole.  As noted, France and Lithuania were involved actors, the first actively supporting Poland, the second passively assisting Russia. British offers of mediation were rejected by Russia.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis. Poland did not seek its assistance. And Russia, not a member at the time, declared that it would reject any attempt at League intervention.  (The Treaty of Riga, signed on 18 March 1921, defined the frontier between the two adversaries. Poland was the clear victor, for it was awarded a border 200 kilometers east of the old Curzon Line. Russia's partial compensation was an end to the war, a high-priority goal because of the multiple dangers to the survival of the Bolshevik regime arising from civil wars against several autonomous White Russian armies and military intervention by major powers in the Far East and North Russia. [See Cases #1--Russian Civil War I--Siberia; and #3--Russian Civil War II--North Russia, in Multiregional PCs: East/West.])
Russia and Persia (Iran) experienced a crisis--the "Enzeli Affair"--from early May 1920 until 26 February 1921. After the collapse of the czarist empire in November 1917 the Bolshevik regime repudiated the 1907 Convention and related notes. Several efforts by Moscow to encourage Persia to establish diplomatic relations in 1918-19 failed. Britain's policy too underwent review: the foreign office favored continued British occupation of southern Persia as a bulwark against communist expansion toward the Persian Gulf; the War Office and the India Office disagreed. Lloyd George's cabinet decided in favor of withdrawal from Persia. As a result the Persian government faced an insoluble dilemma: it wished to curtail foreign, mainly British, influence but recognized that it lacked the military power to protect itself from Russian-controlled communist forces operating in Transcaucasia. The Bolshevik regime perceived the "White" Russian-controlled fleet in the Caspian Sea as a persistent threat to its fragile control of Transcaucasia. When in May 1920 elements of the White Russian navy withdrew to, and anchored in, Persia's Caspian port of Enzeli, Moscow perceived a graver threat, namely, secure sanctuary for a powerful force under the control of its enemy in the prolonged Russian civil war, a threat accentuated by the presence of hostile British troops in Enzeli. Thus on 18 May 1920 Russian naval and land forces, intent on seizing the anchored White Russian fleet, attacked and captured the Caspian seaport triggering a crisis for Persia. The British garrison in Enzeli complied with the demands of the Bolshevik commander and immediately withdrew from the town.  Persia reacted on the 19th by sending a protest note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations claiming violation of Article 11 of the Covenant. (In fact, the Enzeli Affair was the first case submitted to the League Council by a member, as was another [Persia] Iran/USSR dispute to the UN Security Council, over Azerbaijan in January 1946 [see Case #108--Azerbaijan].) Persia also asked the British government to send its troops back to Enzeli. And it attempted to respond to feelers from Moscow about diplomatic relations with the new regime in Russia.  After months of low-level talks, formal negotiations to resolve the dispute opened on 25 October 1920. The League Council discussed the matter in June 1920 but did not intervene: it informed the Persian foreign minister that it would take no action until the results of Persian/Russian negotiations were known. London refused to commit more troops to Persia. And Foreign Affairs Commissar Chicherin informed his Persian counterpart, Prince Firuz, that Soviet forces had been ordered to withdraw from Persia and that Russia wanted friendly relations with the Teheran regime.  Persian mistrust of Soviet intentions was fueled by the continued control of the northern Persian provinces of Gilan and Mazaneran on the part of communist forces in collusion with Jangali rebels, despite assurances that they had been withdrawn. Nonetheless, after lengthy negotiations Persia and Russia signed a Treaty of Friendship on 26 February 1921 terminating the Persian Border crisis: the Soviets pledged not to intervene in Persia's affairs unless a third party did so.  The U.K., the other occupying power, was militarily involved in this international crisis but passively, as noted. So too was France, whose troops aided the British contingent in Persia in 1920. The German consul in Tabriz supported a plan to oust Persia's Prime Minister, Mushir al-Dawlah. And the U.S. Minister to Persia, Caldwell, issued statements praising the Anglo-French action in Persia.  (Soviet forces remained in control of northern Persia until late October 1921. Only after their withdrawal on 15 December did the Iranian Majlis [national assembly] ratify the treaty.)
Sweden and Finland experienced a crisis over the Aaland Islands from 5 June 1920 until 20 October 1921. For more than a century the grand duchy of Finland, including the Aaland Islands, had been an integral part of the czarist empire: it had been ceded to Russia by Sweden in 1809.  On 6 December 1917, a month after the Bolshevik revolution, Finland declared its independence, an act recognized by Russia, France, Germany, and Sweden in January 1918. However, on 29 December 1917 the residents of the Aaland Islands had asserted a right to self-determination and voted to join Sweden. On 2 March 1918, a day before the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and Russia that recognized the independence of Finland, among many other czarist Russia possessions, Germany occupied the Aaland Islands at the request of Finland. German forces remained in Finland until late December 1918. On 1 June 1919 the islanders called for a plebiscite over the issue of joining Sweden. The issue remained dormant for almost a year. On 7 May 1920 Finland's Diet (legislature) granted local autonomy to the Aaland Islands but ruled out secession. Tension rose at the beginning of June with the arrests of two islanders by Finland on a charge of treason. A formal Swedish protest was ignored, and Finland dispatched troops to the Aalands around 5 June. This precipitated a crisis for Sweden, which perceived that a direct military threat could be mounted from the islands. Some Swedes urged the use of force. Sweden responded on the 15th by recalling its minister to Helsinki and appealing to the League of Nations. This dual response, especially the latter act, catalyzed a crisis for Finland, which perceived a threat to territorial integrity and sovereignty over the Aalands.  On 11 July 1920 the U.K. brought the dispute between Sweden and Finland before the League Council under Article 11 of the Covenant. Finland, which was not then a League member, rejected the Council's competence. The next day the Council sought a decision by a committee of three jurists as to whether or not the League had the right to intervene in the dispute. On the basis of the committee’s affirmative ruling on 5 September the Council dispatched a neutral commission of inquiry to the Baltic, which deliberated from November 1920 to February 1921.  Acting on the findings of the commission the League Council, on 24 June 1921, confirmed Finland's sovereignty over the islands, with the requirement that they be demilitarized and given autonomy. Finland and Sweden accepted the recommendations on 27 June and agreed on guarantees for residents of the islands. The agreement, along with demilitarization and neutralization, was formalized on 20 October 1921 by a convention signed by many involved actors: Baltic states Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden; major powers France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K.; and Poland. That formal act terminated the Aaland Islands crisis.  (In 1935 Finland, with the support of Sweden, both of which were concerned with growing insecurity in the Baltic, began to plan the refortification of the Aaland Islands. At the last session of the League of Nations Council in 1938-39 they sought Council approval. All the signatories to the 1921 convention had approved the plan, but the USSR, a nonsignatory, balked and persuaded the Council not to pass a resolution on the matter.)
The first of three interrelated post-World War I crises between these historic enemies in the eastern Mediterranean lasted from 22 June until 9 July 1920. Turkey was the sole crisis actor, with Greece as the triggering entity. British forces occupied Constantinople (Istanbul) in March 1920 symbolizing the demise of the Ottoman Empire. On 18 April the main provisions of a draconian peace treaty were agreed upon by Allied leaders at the San Remo Conference. The Treaty of Sèvres was presented to the Sublime Porte (the government of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople) on 10 June. The sultan's government was to renounce all claims to non-Turkish territory. Hijaz, which later became part of Sa'udi Arabia, was to be recognized as an independent state (see Case #29--Hijaz/Najd War, in 1924-25, in Middle East: Non-PCs). Syria and Lebanon were to become French protectorates (formally mandates under the aegis of the League of Nations in 1922), Palestine, including Trans-Jordan (and Iraq soon after), British Mandates. Smyrna was allocated to Greece for an interim period of five years prior to a plebiscite (see Case #7--Smyrna, in 1919, in Middle East: Non-PCs). The Dodecanese islands and Rhodes were given to Italy. And Thrace and the remaining Aegean islands were assigned to Greece. The Straits and Constantinople were to be internationalized, with the adjacent territory demilitarized. It was a "Carthaginian" peace. Concerned about the growing influence of Turkey's nationalists under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the U.K. provided Greece with a green light to launch an attack in Anatolia. Thus on 22 June 1920 Greek troops in Smyrna began a move to the east triggering a crisis for Turkey: it was a major operation, as the Greeks crossed four points of the Milne Line, laid down in Paris as the demarcation between Greece and Turkey. The Turks, with few and ill-equipped troops in western Anatolia, offered little resistance and, on Kemal's orders, retreated to the city of Eskisehir. The Greeks were thus able to capture Bursa. They also landed another force, which pushed south along the Sea of Marmara and recaptured Izmit. At the same time, another Greek force occupied the major center of Adrianople (Edirne) in Eastern Thrace.  The first Anatolian campaign was halted by Greece on 9 July 1920 in order to prevent a dangerous dispersal of troops in the newly acquired territory over which Greek control had not yet been consolidated. That unilateral act ended Turkey's first crisis in the Greece/Turkey War of 1920-22.  Kemal Atatürk's nationalist forces suffered a defeat; but they scored military successes elsewhere. They also enhanced their claim to the succession to the defunct Ottoman Empire, now a hollow shell of authority. And soon after they achieved an important rapprochement with the Soviet regime: in a treaty of 16 March 1921 Batum was returned to Russia, with Kars and Ardahan recognized by Moscow as part of Turkey. The latter became the focus of a crisis between them soon after World War II (see Case #106--Kars-Ardahan, in the East/ West PC).  The U.K., as noted, was the most highly involved major power providing military aid to the Greek advance. France was initially reticent but eventually provided political support to Greece as well.  There was no involvement in this crisis by the newly established League of Nations.  (The Treaty of Sèvres was imposed on the feeble Ottoman government in Constantinople on 10 August 1920. Turkish nationalists led by Kemal Atatürk vehemently opposed the draft, formed an alternative government, and secured mass support for their attempt to create a new, modern, Western-type political regime [see also Case #11--Cilician War, in 1919-21 in Middle East: Non-PCs]. They rejected the treaty. And after a marked change in the balance of forces in Anatolia in 1922 in favor of Turkey [see Case #25--Greece/Turkey War III], it was replaced by the less draconian Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923. Turkey was still obliged to renounce all claims to the non-Turkish territories of the Ottoman Empire; but it recovered Eastern Thrace to the Maritza River, as well as some of the Aegean islands. The capitulations were abolished. Turkey was freed from reparations payments. The Straits were demilitarized; but if Turkey was at war enemy ships might be excluded. And a separate Greek/ Turkish agreement provided for compulsory exchange of populations.)
A crisis between Poland and Lithuania over the long-disputed city of Vilna lasted from 12 July until 29 November 1920. Bolshevik forces captured Vilna on 5 January 1919 but lost it to the Poles on 4 April. On 8 December 1919 the Allied powers fixed the Polish/Lithuanian boundary (the "Curzon Line") leaving Vilna in Lithuania. A closely-related crisis between Poland and Russia had begun in April 1920 (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC). Russo/Lithuanian hostilities (1919-20) ended with the Treaty of Moscow on 12 July 1920. The Bolshevik regime, then at war with Poland, recognized Lithuania including Vilna. In return, the Russians were allowed to cross Lithuanian territory to engage the Poles. That provision triggered a crisis for Poland. It responded two days later with an attack on Lithuanian forces near Vilna triggering a crisis for Lithuania. Full-scale war continued through the summer.  Poland appealed to the League of Nations on 5 September. Mediation by the League Council began on 16 September and led to an agreement on the 20th providing for a cease-fire and for Lithuania's neutrality in the Polish/Russian War; Vilna remained part of Lithuania. The (abortive) Treaty of Suwalki, incorporating these terms, was signed on 7 October.  Hours later Polish General Zeligowski crossed the frontier and occupied Vilna on the 9th. However, his attempts at further expansion into the Lithuanian heartland failed. Further mediation by the League of Nations led indirectly to a mutually accepted Protocol on 29 November 1920 calling for a plebiscite to decide the fate of Vilna. This agreement brought hostilities--and the Vilna I crisis--to an end.  Russia was highly involved in this crisis, providing direct military aid to Lithuania; and it was ultimately responsible for Poland's military failure in this international crisis.  (The Vilna plebiscite -- arranged with the aid of the League of Nations and held on 8 January 1922 under Zeligowski's supervision -- showed, not surprisingly, a majority in favor of union with Poland. That status was formalized on 18 April. Lithuania rejected the outcome and severed relations with Poland. So it remained until 1927, following the Vilna II crisis [see Case #36].)
A second--multiphase--international crisis during the Greece/Turkey War in Anatolia lasted from 6 January until 12 September 1921. Once more, Turkey was the crisis actor, Greece the triggering entity. Greek Prime Minister Venizelos's defeat in the autumn 1920 elections and the subsequent return of exiled King Constantine intensified the dream of many Greeks for an Anatolian empire. The restoration of the old regime, however, gave France and Italy a pretext to disassociate themselves from Athens's ambitions; and they came to terms with Kemal Atatürk, leading to a withdrawal of their forces from Anatolia. Only the U.K. remained loyal to Greece. In the meantime Turkish nationalists achieved control over the stillborn Armenian state. They also concluded a military agreement with Bolshevik Russia in late April 1920 thereby securing their eastern flank, with the added benefit of potential Soviet military aid. Perceiving an opportunity for territorial gain in the midst of Turkey's turmoil, Greece launched a second--multiphase--campaign of the ongoing war east of Bursa on 6 January 1921. This triggered another crisis for Turkey. However, Greek forces met fierce resistance in the valley of Inönü and hurriedly retreated to Bursa four days later.  After a pause Greece resumed its offensive on 23 March, to the north of Bursa and in central Anatolia from Usak: the key goal was the Turkish nationalist stronghold of Eskisehir. The Greeks captured Afyonkarahisar and penetrated Turkish defenses near Inönü. But Turkish resistance again drove the Greeks back ending this phase on 1 April. They attacked once more on 10 July, from the south, with Eskisehir still the main target, but this time more successfully. The Turks were taken by surprise and were compelled to evacuate that strategic city in central Anatolia in late July.  The last phase of the Greek campaign in 1921 began on 13 August, this time in the direction of Ankara, the nationalist capital. Full-scale war raged for a month, until 12 September, by which time all Greek forces had been expelled to the west of the Sakarya River, Ankara's last natural defense line. Negotiations between the adversaries took place in London but played no role in crisis abatement. Violence and the balance of military power determined the outcome, which was a victory for Turkey, even though Greek forces had captured and held Eskisehir. The end of the second crisis of the Greece/Turkey War was a watershed event stopping hostilities for almost a year.  Three major powers were involved in Greece/Turkey War II. The U.K. provided political support to Greece, though less vigorously than in the first military campaign when Venizelos, whom Prime Minister Lloyd George admired, was in power in Athens. Russia provided military assistance to Turkey during the August 1920 phase of the fighting. And Italy, resentful of Greece after the Smyrna crisis (see Case #7, in Middle East: Non-PCs), was supportive of Turkey as well.  As with the other two Greece/Turkey War cases, the League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
A crisis between Panama and Costa Rica over disputed territory lasted from 21 February to 24 August 1921. Costa Rica and Panama (and earlier, Colombia, which held sovereignty over Panama until 1903) had long claimed title to the territory of Pueblo Nuevo de Coto along their common border. Numerous efforts to settle the boundary dispute, in 1825, 1856, 1865, 1876, 1880, and 1886, had failed. The most recent attempt, the White (arbitration) Award of 1914, ruled in favor of Costa Rica. Panama continued to occupy the territory claiming that U.S. Supreme Court Justice White had exceeded his authority. And for six years Costa Rica did not act to implement the White Award. The status quo changed drastically on 21 February 1921: Costa Rican forces unexpectedly occupied a village in the de Coto region triggering a crisis for Panama. On the 27th Panamanian police struck back creating a crisis for Costa Rica. Minor clashes ensued for several days. On the 28th U.S. Secretary of State Hughes warned both states not to use violence to solve the dispute. Secretary-General Drummond of the League of Nations initiated a fact-finding inquiry into the dispute on the 28th. On 2 March Panama appealed to the League to punish Costa Rica for sending troops into the disputed area. On the 4th the League Council called on the foreign ministers of the disputants to adhere to their obligations as League members. On the 7th-8th Costa Rica, then Panama, agreed to suspend hostilities. The U.S. offered to arbitrate on 16 March and warned Panama that the U.S. would enforce the White Award, if necessary. To indicate its resolve a battalion of U.S. marines was dispatched to the Canal Zone. Panama continued to reject the White Award--which Costa Rica had accepted from its inception--until 24 August 1921 when, under the threat of U.S. military intervention, it relented and set in motion withdrawal from the disputed territory thereby terminating the crisis.  The Pan American Union was not involved in this Central American crisis.  (Costa Rica regained formal possession of the de Coto region on 9 September. An international commission was later established to resolve residual land disputes but Panama refused to participate.)
Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands experienced a crisis over reparations payments from 3 March to 11 May 1921. The Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, incorporated the principle of reparations by Germany following World War I. A schedule of reparations payments was formulated at a conference of victorious European powers in Paris in January 1921 and was reaffirmed at a conference in London in February-March. France was insistent on their enforcement. German counterproposals on 1 March were rejected. An ultimatum by the Allies led by France and the U.K. on 3 March 1921 triggered a crisis for Germany. This was followed by a threat of sanctions on the 7th. The next day Duisburg, Ruhrort, and Dusseldorf were occupied by French forces. President Ebert decried the occupation of German territory as a breach of the Versailles Treaty but acknowledged that Germany was "not in a position to oppose force with force." German ambassadors to London, Paris, and Brussels were recalled. On 10 March Germany appealed to the League of Nations, but Secretary-General Drummond ignored the petition. The League remained aloof throughout this crisis.  Both the Belgians and the Dutch were quietly opposed to the French occupation of the Ruhr: the former viewed it as a danger to Belgium's security; and the latter feared being drawn into a Franco/German conflict. For Belgium, a crisis was triggered by Prime Minister Briand's speech to the French Senate on 5 April indicating that France would act unilaterally and occupy the entire Left Bank of the Rhine if Germany did not meet its financial obligations by 1 May. Belgium was concerned about both the consequences of not joining France against Germany--"a violent storm would burst against them"--and of participating in a French-led occupation, not knowing how far France would go in its punitive action. It also feared that French control of the Ruhr would make the Belgian economy more dependent on France. Reluctantly Belgium agreed to join France in its declared intention to occupy the Ruhr on 2 May, if necessary. The Netherlands, too, was concerned about the likely negative spillover effects of French occupation of the Ruhr, specifically the possibility of Franco/German military hostilities at Duisburg, which lay close to the Dutch frontier.  The trigger to Holland's crisis was partial mobilization of France's armed forces on 2 May in preparation for occupation of the Ruhr. The same day the Dutch foreign minister sought U.S. diplomatic intervention to dissuade France from proceeding with the occupation; and Belgium's premier informed the U.S. ambassador in Brussels that the occupation "was to be avoided if at all possible."  The U.K. was loyal to France throughout this crisis. A joint Anglo-French ultimatum on 5 May set in motion the de-escalation of the crisis by renewing the threat of occupation of the Ruhr if Germany did not accept the schedule of payments by the 12th. The German government resigned in protest. Its successor under Wirth accepted the conditions on the 11th terminating the crisis for all three actors and the German Reparations crisis as a whole.  (The issue of reparations generated other crises in 1923 and 1924--see Cases #27 and #30.)
Three of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's successor states--Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Hungary--experienced a two-phase crisis from 27 March until 15 November 1921. Karl IV, the last Hapsburg Emperor of Austria-Hungary, abdicated in November 1918 and was exiled to Switzerland; but he did not abdicate his right to the throne. Early in 1921 the Conference of Ambassadors, acting for the Supreme Council (Big Ten) at the Paris Peace Conference, issued a decree forbidding the restoration of the Hapsburg family to the vacant Hungarian throne. Moreover, several European governments issued statements indicating what recourse they might have if a Hapsburg reascended the throne in Budapest. On 27 March 1921 Karl unexpectedly returned to his homeland and called upon the Regent of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, to transfer his powers to the rightful ruler. This act triggered a crisis for Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The latter responded two days later by declaring that it would regard any attempt to restore Karl as a casus belli. And Prague responded on the 30th with a Note to Hungary threatening diplomatic, economic, and military measures if Karl was not deported promptly. These warnings triggered a crisis for Hungary: they were perceived as threats of invasion and occupation, as well as a challenge to its political regime, by two neighbors then bound by a military alliance. Budapest responded on 1 April by adopting measures to deport Karl.  More pressure was imposed by the Conference of Ambassadors: it sent a Note to Hungary warning of "disastrous consequences" if Karl was not removed. And on the 4th Czechoslovakia issued an ultimatum demanding Karl's deportation by the 7th. Yugoslavia supported the Czechoslovak action. So too did Romania. The first stage of this crisis--but not the international crisis as a whole--ended for all actors on 5 April when Karl was induced by Hungary, quietly, to return to Switzerland.  Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia each perceived a second crisis over a renewed Hapsburg attempt to regain the Hungarian throne. In the months following Karl's resumed exile in Switzerland efforts were made to solve the "Hapsburg Question." While negotiations were in motion Karl suddenly returned to Hungary once more, on 20 October 1921, triggering a fresh foreign policy crisis for the same three states. The situation was aggravated by his arrival in German-speaking Burgenland, then a contentious issue for Hungary and Austria (see Case #24--Burgenland Dispute)--and by the fact that royalist forces there rallied to Karl. In fact, he marched on Budapest with an improvised force.  On 22 October Hungary's government acknowledged a fear of invasion by its neighbors, with good reason. Czechoslovakia mobilized its army that day. And Yugoslavia did so the next day. The Conference of Ambassadors accentuated Hungary's concern by threatening to allow the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania) to act as it saw fit in the crisis. On 29 October the first two Little Entente allies issued an ultimatum threatening to invade Hungary unless the Hapsburg Question was resolved. Karl was arrested, handed over to the Allies, and exiled on 1 November to Portugal's island of Madeira (where he died in 1922).  Under pressure from the victorious Allies, Hungary's National Assembly passed a law on 10 November 1921 excluding a Hapsburg restoration to the throne forever. As a result Yugoslavia demobilized its forces on the 12th and Czechoslovakia on the 15th indicating the end of the international crisis as a whole arising from Karl's attempt to regain the throne of Hungary.  (The former imperial family was also barred from neighboring Austria. When the Hapsburg heir defied this law 75 years later, in March 1996, President Klestil urged the repeal of an "anachronistic" law, noting that Karl's aged sons did not pose a threat to Austria.)  There were many involved actors. France, Italy, Japan, and the U.K., acting through the Conference of Ambassadors, as noted, adopted a tough stand against a Hapsburg restoration. Romania, even as a passive member of the Little Entente, was perceived by Hungary as another potential invader. Austria was perceived by Hungary as actively supporting the royalist forces backing Karl. Spain and Switzerland, along with Austria, were involved in the negotiations to find a suitable exile for Karl. Poland sent a protest note to Hungary. And Portugal provided a place of exile for Karl. This case also revealed the power and solidarity of the Little Entente in the early 1920s.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
Yugoslavia and Austria experienced a crisis from 11 May to 21 June 1921 over the threat of secession by several Austrian provinces and their merger with Germany. The Republic of Austria was proclaimed on 13 November 1918, the day after the abdication of Karl IV, the last emperor of Austria-Hungary. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, signed by Austria on 10 September 1919, the union of Austria with Germany (anschluss) was forbidden except with the League of Nations's consent. Almost at once and continuing through 1920 and 1921 some Austrian provinces attempted to secede and to join the new German Republic, despite statements by the Allied Powers from as early as December 1919 that they would use all means available to prevent the anschluss of Austria or any Austrian province with Germany. Despite France's warning that it would withhold aid to Austria if a plebiscite in Tyrol called for 24 April 1921 was held, the people of Tyrol voted in favor of union with Germany. The Tyrol precedent led Salzburg to announce its own plebiscite on 29 May. This generated anxiety among Austria's neighbors and the major powers. Salzburg's announcement, especially the possibility of its merger with Germany, triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia on 11 May 1921. It responded with an implied threat to occupy the Austrian province of Carinthia if the Salzburg plebiscite were held. The rumor reached Vienna on 12 May, triggering a crisis for Austria. The Mayr government could not prevent the plebiscite on 29 May which, like Tyrol, also strongly supported union with Germany. France and Italy intimated to Austria's ministers in Paris and Rome that they might occupy Austria to prevent an anschluss.  Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania protested against the plebiscites. The attitude of Germany and the U.K. was more muted, the former favoring, the latter opposing, the Austrian separatists. Tension rose when the province of Styria called its own plebiscite for 3 June.  The Mayr cabinet resigned on 1 June. A new Austrian cabinet was formed on 21 June under Schöber. The crisis was resolved by assurances from the other Austrian provinces that plebiscites would not be held for at least six months and by the suspension of the Tyrol and Salzburg thrust to separation and union with Germany.  Many states, as noted, exhibited varying degrees of involvement: Yugoslavia and Austria as the crisis actors; France and Italy, with a threat to occupy Austria; and a lower political profile by Germany, Poland, Romania, and the U.K.  The League of Nations was not involved.  (The crisis over Austrian separatists was gestating at the same time as the first stage of the crisis arising from the deposed Emperor Karl's attempts to regain the Hungarian throne [see Case #21--Karl's Return to Hungary]. Integration into Germany was to occur in March 1938 under the threat of imminent invasion by Nazi Germany [see Case #60--Anschluss].)
Albania and Yugoslavia were enmeshed in a crisis over territory from 7 July to 18 November 1921. In April and June 1921 Albania appealed to the League of Nations to delimit its frontiers. Greece and Yugoslavia sought to forestall this process because of their own territorial ambitions vis-à-vis Albania. Minor skirmishes occurred between Albanian and Yugoslav forces. In the first week of July 1921, around the 7th, Yugoslav troops occupied previously demilitarized territory triggering a crisis for Albania. As early as 13 July Yugoslav officials expressed their anticipation of an Albanian attack, triggering a crisis for Belgrade. It came on 9 August, when Albanian forces occupied Yugoslav territory. Full-scale war ensued and continued until November.  Under the authority of the League of Nations, the Conference of Ambassadors, then comprising Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, and the U.K., defined the Albania/Yugoslavia border in mid-November 1921. Moreover, the U.K. attempted, unsuccessfully, to invoke Article XVI of the League Covenant with a call for military action against Yugoslavia. The latter development accentuated Yugoslavia's perception of a potential grave military threat by the major powers. Together these two events had a positive impact: on 18 November 1921 the Albanian and Yugoslav representatives to the League accepted the border delimitation and pledged friendly relations. Albania was formally recognized. Their crisis was resolved.  Yugoslavia, which still controlled the northern part of Albania, withdrew its forces in 1921 under pressure from the League.  The most highly involved actors were the League of Nations Council and the U.K. Greece and Romania issued statements during the crisis. Albania misperceived Russian military involvement in support of Yugoslavia.
Hungary and Austria experienced a crisis over the disputed territory of Burgenland (German West Hungary) from 28 August until 28 December 1921. The treaties of St. Germain (10 September 1919) and Trianon (4 June 1920) had assigned the predominantly German-speaking area of Burgenland, only 15 miles from Vienna, to Austria. The date of the transfer from Hungary was fixed for 28 August 1921. Austrian police entered Burgenland that day, triggering a crisis for Hungary. In minor clashes they were rebuffed by regular and irregular Hungarian forces, triggering a crisis for Austria the same day. The next day its chancellor acknowledged the likelihood of more serious developments in Burgenland. Several days later Austria's government asserted that the peace of the republic was threatened.  Through the mediation of Italy, whose foreign minister, Torretta, used back-channel negotiations with Hungary, a plebiscite was incorporated in the Venice Protocol on 13 October. Austria, however, was dissatisfied with some of the provisions and ratified the Protocol only under pressure from the great powers. The plebiscite, held in December 1921, gave most of Burgenland--except Odenburg--to Austria and ended the crisis for both on 28 December.  Among the involved actors were three major powers, as noted: Italy mediated the Venice Protocol, which France and the U.K. pressed Austria to accept. Czechoslovakia's offer of mediation was declined by Austria.  The League of Nations, to which Austria appealed, was nonresponsive.
Greece experienced a crisis with Turkey in the last phase of their spasmodic war from 26 August to 15 September 1922. After Greece's severe defeat in the last stage of its 1921 military campaign in Anatolia the major powers initiated an armistice proposal. It was rejected by Mustafa Kemal because it did not provide for total Greek evacuation of Anatolia. The Turkish nationalists had also strengthened their position politically through a tacit alliance with France--the Andara Accord of October 1921. And Greece, facing serious economic problems at home, could not resume the war. The result was a lull in hostilities for more than 11 months. Turkish nationalist forces launched a surprise multipronged attack on 26 August 1922 designed to expel all Greek forces from Anatolia. This triggered a crisis for Greece. The Turks, facing little resistance, recaptured Eskisehir, Afyon, and Dumlupinar. The Greeks were soon in full retreat. On 9 September they were compelled to relinquish the supreme prize, Smyrna (Izmir). By 15 September all Greek forces had evacuated Anatolia, marking the end of this crisis and the Greece/Turkey War of 1920-22. Turkey had won an unqualified victory; and Greece had suffered a humiliating defeat.  No other state actor was involved. The League of Nations too was inactive in this crisis.  The outcome reinforced deep-rooted mutual resentment and hostility that were further strengthened by crises over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea in the 1970s and 1980s (see Cases #202, #223, #257, #272, #349, #376).
Turkey and the U.K. experienced a crisis over the Neutral Zone of Chanak (Canakkale) from 23 September to 11 October 1922. The ignominious Greek withdrawal from Anatolia on 15 September 1922 marked the end of the Greece/Turkey War (see Case #25--Greece/Turkey War III). An important spillover effect was the removal of the buffer between Turkish and British troops stationed on both sides of the Dardanelles. Public opinion in the U.K. and the West generally seemed strongly opposed to the resumption of hostilities in Anatolia. Moreover, the British media were adamant about the need to withdraw from Asia Minor. And Prime Minister Lloyd George's urgent request for military support from the British Dominions, on 18 September, met with an unmistakably negative response. The continuing risk of war prompted London to offer an armistice to Kemal Atatürk on 23 September triggering a crisis for the nationalist regime: an armistice was perceived as a cover for continued British occupation of Turkish territory. Kemal Atatürk responded the same day by dispatching troops into the Neutral Zone drawn around the city of Chanak on the Anatolian bank of the Dardanelles. This catalyzed a crisis for the U.K. There was no violence; in fact, Turkish forces halted their advance before reaching U.K. military installations.  British troops were put on a state of alert but were ordered not to fire first. Three days later the U.K. sent an ultimatum to Kemal Atatürk via its ambassador to Turkey demanding evacuation of the Neutral Zone by Turkish forces. However, Lord Harrington believed that the Turks did not want war and did not deliver the ultimatum! He so informed London on 1 October. The same day, following French pressure and a meeting between the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, and Turkey's deputy foreign minister, Mustafa Kemal accepted the earlier offer of an armistice thus removing the need for a renewed British ultimatum. With war still lurking in the background, a conference began on the 3rd at Mudanya on the Anatolian side of the Sea of Marmara. After an initial deadlock on the 5th an armistice was signed on 11 October ending the Chanak crisis.  The agreement was a compromise for the U.K., a notable victory for Turkey. The former averted an undesirable war and succeeded in persuading Kemal Atatürk to remove his forces from the Neutral Zone around Chanak. Turkey obtained British recognition of its sovereignty over Istanbul, the Straits, and Eastern Thrace, the last at the expense of the Greeks. Moreover, the Mudanya armistice created the basis for a peace conference, which produced the much less punitive Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923, replacing what for Turkey was the odious Treaty of Sèvres on 10 August 1920, a triumph for Kemal Atatürk.  The League of Nations was not involved in this case.
Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands experienced a crisis arising from the reparations issue from 22 January to 27 September 1923. The conflict over German reparations continued to create tension after the crisis of 1921. By December 1922 Germany was declared to be in default regarding deliveries of lumber. And in early January 1923 it was declared in default of coal deliveries. On 10 January France and Belgium informed Germany that a commission of engineers, including Italians, would enter the Ruhr escorted by French and Belgian troops to facilitate the delivery of coal. The next day the Ruhr was occupied, an act that brought a strong protest from the German government. It also prompted Bolshevik Russia to make Poland aware that any Polish designs on German territory, notably Upper Silesia, would not be tolerated. The Soviets were trying to neutralize Poland and to improve Russo-German relations, in the hope that this would pave the way for the spread of communism in Germany. Threats from Moscow generated a Polish perception of threat, time pressure, and higher probability of hostilities with Russia, on 22 January 1923. This concern was evident in the remark by a Polish minister to the German foreign office the same day, that Russian military moves made his government "very nervous." There was no clear termination date for Poland; rather, it faded in late July 1923.  Germany, the principal actor in this international crisis, did not perceive a crisis until 28 February, when its government expressed concern about civilian disturbances precipitated by the occupation of the Ruhr. The major German response was to approve a series of economic ordinances beginning on 16 March in support of passive opposition to the occupation; but Germany also negotiated with its adversaries.  The Netherlands entered the crisis on 9 March as a result of fear of the prospects for a new European war generated by information communicated to one of its ministers by French officials. It responded four days later by seeking--and getting--British assurances about the occupation of the Ruhr.  The German government fell in August. And its successor began to reassess the tactic of passive resistance. On 27 September Germany capitulated by calling off passive resistance, terminating the crisis for Germany and the Netherlands and the larger international crisis over the Ruhr.  There were many involved actors in Ruhr I: the three crisis actors; Belgium and France, Italy, Japan, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR, along with the Vatican. Belgium expressed concern over the occupation; while the U.K. reassured Belgium by terming the occupation illegal. The League of Nations was not involved.
Greece was confronted with a foreign policy crisis over the island of Corfu from 31 August to 29 September 1923. The commission appointed by the Conference of Ambassadors to delimit the Albania/Greece border (see Case #23--Albanian Frontier, in 1921, in Italy/ Albania/Yugoslavia PC) resumed its work in May 1923. From the outset the relations between the commission, especially its Italian Chairman, General Enrico Tellini, and Greece were strained: the Greek delegate openly claimed that he was partial to Albania's claims.  On 27 August Tellini and three assistants were murdered by unknown assailants at Kakavia near the Greek/Albanian frontier within Greek territory. Two days later Italy delivered a seven-point ultimatum to Athens demanding compliance within 24 hours. The Greek prime minister made counterproposals on the 30th, to no avail. The next day a protest note from the Conference of Ambassadors, with Italy's concurrence, was presented to Greece.  (It was learned later that, in July-August 1923, a secret decision was taken at the highest level, by Mussolini himself, to occupy Corfu in case Greece reacted adversely to Italy's proclamation of sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands, long part of Greek territory. Military preparations to that end were taken in August.)  Italy's behavior was a classic example of a "pure opportunity" crisis actor. According to a definitive biography of Mussolini, "[H]e was casting about for some striking act of international brigandage that would eclipse memories of D'Annunzio's invasion of Fiume.... [I]n July 1923, ... he ordered plans to be prepared for a landing on the Greek island of Corfu ... in reply to the Greek 'provocations' that he intended to organize" [Smith 1982, 72]. On 31 August, the same day as the protest note from the Conference of Ambassadors, Italian naval forces shelled and occupied the unfortified Greek island of Corfu, triggering a crisis for Greece. Denouncing the seizure of Corfu as a "warlike" act, Greece appealed to the League of Nations on 1 September under Articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant. On the 2nd it pledged cooperation to the Conference of Ambassadors and proposed an international inquiry.  The League Council debated the issue on the 4th despite Italy's contention that it lacked competence in the matter; but the Council virtually withdrew from the task of crisis management by transferring the dispute to the Conference of Ambassadors. The Conference ruled in favor of Italy on the 5th: Greece was ordered to pay an indemnity of 50 million lira to Italy, clearly implying Greece's guilt for the Tellini murders. Four days later Greece accepted the demands of the Conference and Italy regarding reparations, in principle. Italy was to evacuate Corfu, which it did on 27 September; but it escaped censure for its self-declared "temporary occupation" of the island. The crisis ended on the 29th, when Greece agreed to pay the indemnity under protest.  There were many involved actors in the Corfu Incident of 1923: the members of the Conference of Ambassadors--Belgium, France, Japan, and the U.K., apart from Italy; Albania and Yugoslavia; and the League of Nations Council.  (A related dispute between the U.K. and Albania over mine-laying operations in the Corfu Channel during World War II, which caused damage and casualties to ships of the Royal Navy in 1946, was resolved by an even-handed ruling of the International Court of Justice in April 1949 without becoming a full-blown international crisis: the IJC awarded damages to the U.K., but British mine-sweeping operations in 1946 were termed a violation of Albanian sovereignty [see also Case #71--Invasion of Albania, in 1939, in Italy/ Albania/Yugoslavia PC].)
Najd and Hijaz, two desert kingdoms in the Arabian Peninsula, precursors to Sa'udi Arabia, experienced a crisis-war from 7 March 1924 until 19 December 1925. Najd is the vast, sparsely populated, northern region of the Arabian Peninsula. Although formally a province of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until the end of World War I, it was largely ignored by the Sublime Porte in Constantinople. It was unified by the orthodox Wahabi Muslims in the eighteenth century and was ruled continuously by the al-Sa'ud dynasty except for a decade beginning in the early 1890s. Its capital, Riyadh, was reconquered in 1902 by Sa'ud Ibn 'Abd-ul-'Aziz, who then steadily extended the Saudi domain to the entire Arabian Peninsula except the south--Yemen, Hadhramaut, and Oman.  Hijaz comprised the western region of Arabia. It extends from the Gulf of Aqaba and the border of the Kingdom of Jordan to 'Asir with an area of 120,000-150,000 square miles. The home of Islam's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, Hijaz was the heartland of the Muslim faith. It also possessed political and economic importance, the latter due to substantial revenue deriving from the continuous flow of Muslim pilgrims and from Jidda, the main port of Arabia on the Red Sea.  Like Najd, Hijaz was an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries. A rebellion in 1916, part of the "Arab Revolt" against Turkish rule, led to a short-lived Kingdom of Hijaz (1916-25) under Hussein Ibn 'Ali, the Sharif of Mecca, a Hashemite and traditional rival of the Sa'udis, the great-grandfather of King Hussein of Jordan.  Tension between the two rivals for primacy in Arabia and Islam, the Saudis and the Hashemites, became acute in 1923 with clashes between Najd and Hijaz pilgrims; but the conflict was controlled by their common patron, the U.K., which had played that role since the Arab Revolt during World War I. Although 'Abd-ul-'Aziz sought and exploited any opportunity to extend the Sa'udi kingdom to all of Arabia, his decision to attack Hijaz was triggered by King Hussein's assumption on 7 March 1924 of the title of Caliph, which had been vacant since the end of the Ottoman Empire and had been abolished by the new secular Republic of Turkey. Hussein's move, although not recognized by the Muslim world, offended the orthodox Wahabis and especially their military core, the Ikhwan. It was perceived as a visible threat to the Sa'udi aspiration for hegemony in Arabia and primacy in Islam. The delayed Wahabi response was a military campaign against Hijaz beginning on 29 August 1924.  By 1 September Wahabi forces were at the gates of Ta'if, a summer resort for Hijaz and, later, Sa'udi Arabian notables, barely 40 kilometers from Mecca. This triggered a grave crisis for the king of Hijaz. Military resistance was in vain; and Ta'if fell on 5 September. The Wahabis advanced toward Mecca. Hussein abdicated on 3 October in favor of his son, Ali, and fled to Aqaba. Mecca was overrun on the 13th.  The Wahabis laid siege to the three remaining cities in Hijaz--Medina, Yanbu, and Jidda. The port city held out until 19 December 1925 marking the end of the crisis and the collapse of Hijaz as a state.  No great power, nor the League of Nations, was involved in this crisis.  (The Sa'udi ruler, 'Abd-ul-'Aziz, better known as Ibn Sa'ud, assumed the title, King of Hijaz and Sultan of Najd, in 1926, changing it the following year to King of Hijaz and Najd, and held the title until 1932, when the united state was renamed "The Sa'udi Arabian Kingdom.")  (A geographically related crisis focusing on 'Asir occurred a decade later [see Case #44--Saudi/Yemen War, in 1933-1934].)
Germany and France were the adversaries in another crisis over reparations from 29 April to 30 August 1924. Despite Germany's abandonment of passive resistance to demands for reparations payments, tensions between the West European victor and vanquished in World War I became more acute. The Dawes Plan of 9 April 1924, which specified a schedule of German payments for five years, was accepted by Germany a week later; but it insisted on immediate evacuation of the Ruhr. However, France (and Belgium) refused to withdraw from the Ruhr until 12 months of reparations payments were made. A standoff ensued, and tensions escalated. France's demand precipitated a crisis for Germany on 29 April: it feared that French Premier Poincaré's behavior was designed to foment a crisis thereby permitting France to use more coercive measures to achieve its aims--humiliation of Germany and weakening its economy. France's pressure on Germany to comply, and Germany's reluctance to pay further reparations without a guarantee of French withdrawal from the Ruhr and its demilitarization, maintained a high level of stress.  France perceived a crisis on 8 July, as evident in newly elected Premier Herriot's expression of concern for the military security of France: when Germany was "strong enough to refuse" to pay reparations, it would instigate a "new war." On 9 August the German delegation to a conference in London agreed to implement the Dawes Plan provisions on reparations. And on the 16th Germany signed a protocol with France and Belgium ending Germany's second Ruhr crisis: it was agreed that the occupation of the Ruhr would end by August 1925. For France, the second Ruhr crisis ended on 30 August, when the London Conference agreements were formally adopted, one day after the Reichstag ratified the protocol.  During the talks in London, British Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald shared mediation efforts with a group of Americans led by Frank B. Kellogg and Owen Young. The main source of disagreement between the German and French delegations at the London conference was over the timetable for French withdrawal. MacDonald bore much of the task of finding common ground between the two and sought face-saving tactics for both sides. He was also able to keep the agenda focused by avoiding discussion of disarmament issues. Japan and Italy were also highly involved in the negotiations that led to crisis resolution. Yugoslavia and to a lesser extent Greece, Romania, and Portugal were also involved in the negotiations. The League of Nations was not involved.
Turkey and the U.K. were enmeshed in a crisis over the Iraqi/Turkish borderland from 29 September to 15 November 1924. Mosul is an oil-rich area straddling the borders of northwestern Iraq, eastern Turkey, and northern Syria. Like the rest of the Arab Near East, Mosul was a province (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries, from 1517 until World War I.  Under the terms of the (secret) Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 Mosul was assigned to a postwar French zone of influence in the Middle East including Syria and Lebanon. However, in December 1918 French Premier Clemenceau agreed to British Prime Minister Lloyd George's request to transfer Mosul to what was anticipated to be the British zone of influence including Mesopotamia (Iraq), in exchange for British concessions on the Rhine. Nationalist Turkey, however, persisted in its claim to Mosul on ethnic and realpolitik grounds: its population was Kurdish--non-Arab, though Muslim; and the vilayet was not under British control at the time of the Mudrost Armistice in October 1918.  The Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, the initial, abortive peace agreement between the victorious Allies and Turkey, awarded Mosul to Iraq. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, the counterpart of the Versailles Treaty vis-à-vis Turkey, provided a procedure for resolving the territorial dispute but not its content: the U.K., by then the Mandatory Power in Iraq, and the Republic of Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, were to attempt to reach agreement by direct negotiations; if that failed the dispute was to be referred to the League of Nations Council. The U.K. did so in August 1924. The Council requested--and received--from the disputants a commitment to accept its decision as binding. It then decided to dispatch a commission of inquiry to the contested area. In the meantime both claimants were taking measures to consolidate what each perceived to be its part of Mosul. This led to minor frontier skirmishes. The U.K. accused Turkey of crossing into Iraqi territory under British Mandate. Turkey responded with the charge that Royal Air Force sorties over Turkish territory violated the Treaty of Lausanne. A serious clash occurred in mid-September 1924. On the 29th the British chargé d'affaires in Constantinople called for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the disputed zone within 48 hours, triggering a crisis for Turkey. Turkey replied in kind on 3 October catalyzing a crisis for the U.K. The League Council called on the two parties to respect the status quo.  On 9 October the U.K. escalated the crisis by issuing an ultimatum to Turkey to evacuate its forces by the 11th, with a threat to take "all necessary military measures" to restore the status quo ante if necessary. Turkey responded the next day with a Note to the Secretary-General of the League acknowledging the high probability of a violent confrontation and requesting the League to fix the boundary. The U.K. accepted the proposal on the 14th, in effect withdrawing its ultimatum of the 9th.  At Turkey's insistence--it challenged the Council's competence to set the boundary since the dispute concerned provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne--the League Council sought an advisory opinion from the World Court. The Court ruled that the Council had jurisdiction under Article 15 of the Covenant but that its decision required unanimity excluding the votes of the disputants; and its decision had to be accepted as binding.  A League-appointed commission investigated the competing claims. It reported that the majority population of Mosul, the Kurds, preferred independence to Turkish or Iraqi rule; if the options excluded independence they preferred being part of Iraq--on condition that Iraq remained a British Mandate for another 25 years. The commission recommended in favor of Iraq, contingent upon that condition or the return of most of Mosul to Turkey. Iraq--and the U.K.--accepted the condition. On that basis the Council defined an interim boundary, the "Brussels Line," and requested both parties to withdraw from the disputed zone by 15 November. The U.K. and Turkey accepted the ruling and the boundary, ending the crisis that day.  (The Mosul Land Dispute was formally resolved on 5 June 1926 with the signing of a tripartite agreement--the U.K., Turkey, Iraq--incorporating an agreed boundary between Turkey and Iraq.)  (In the context of this dispute the U.K. attempted to secure for Iraq control over a small piece of Turkish territory inhabited by the Christian Assyrian community--but failed.)
An armed confrontation between Greece and Bulgaria occurred from 19 October to 15 December 1925. Like most Balkan frontiers during the inter-world war era the border between Greece and Bulgaria in 1925 was tense and prone to military incidents. A minor incident between Greek and Bulgarian border guards on 19 October 1925--one Greek soldier was killed--triggered a crisis for Greece: due to distorted intelligence and faulty communications it was misreported to Athens as a large-scale premeditated Bulgarian attack and was perceived as threatening Greece's security. The Greek response was swift: on 20 October an army corps was ordered to the frontier; and on the 22nd Greek troops, reportedly supported by artillery and air power, crossed the border, triggering a crisis for Bulgaria.  Sofia massed troops in the area; but in order to secure great power support it responded to the crisis primarily by diplomatic means. During the first few days Bulgaria requested a cease-fire. On the 22nd it appealed to the League of Nations requesting an immediate meeting of the League Council to resolve the crisis.  Within an hour of his receipt of the Bulgarian telegram early in the morning of 23 October the League's Secretary-General called an emergency meeting of the Council for the 26th, the earliest possible date. He also informed the (French) President of the Council, Briand, who immediately exhorted both parties to cease all military movements at once and withdraw their troops behind their own frontiers.  The extraordinary meeting of the League Council on 26 October demanded confirmation within 24 hours that orders for the withdrawal of (Greek) troops had been issued, to be completed within 60 hours. The U.K., France, and Italy were "requested" to send their military attachés to monitor the withdrawal. Under League and great power pressure, Greece complied, ordering the suspension of hostilities two and a half hours before a scheduled launching of an offensive on Petric, a center of activity of the anti-Greek, Macedonian revolutionary organization, the Komitadji. Its forces were withdrawn by 29 October.  The League Council then dispatched a commission of inquiry, after securing from both parties a commitment to accept and implement its decision, that is, compulsory arbitration. Responsibility for the incident was divided: Bulgaria, for the killing of a Greek soldier; Greece, for the breach of the peace causing heavy casualties and material damage in Bulgarian border villages. Greece was ordered to pay a nominal indemnity (45,000 pounds sterling) to Bulgaria. The crisis ended on 15 December, when both parties accepted the Council's ruling. However, conflict over the frontier persisted.  There were many involved actors, both major and minor powers. The U.K., France, and Italy strongly supported the League's pressure on Greece to terminate the hostilities. Romania, Yugoslavia, Germany, and Turkey were less involved. The League of Nations played the pivotal role in crisis management: "The Graeco-Bulgarian dispute was the culminating moment of this [first] phase of the history of the League" (Zimmern 1936, 372).
Nicaragua experienced a crisis with Mexico from 17 August 1926 until 15 May 1927. Several months after a (periodic) withdrawal of U.S. marines, in August 1925, Nicaragua was again embroiled in civil war: it erupted because opponents of President Emiliano Chamorro interpreted U.S. nonrecognition of his regime as carte blanche to overthrow him. Moreover, Mexico's President Plutarco Calles seized upon the opportunity of internal disarray to reassert Mexico's influence in Central America by aiding the Liberal opposition to Chamorro. The trigger to Nicaragua's foreign policy crisis was the Chamorro government's awareness on 17 August 1926 that a Mexican auxiliary warship had set sail with men and arms to aid Nicaraguan rebels. Nicaragua responded on the 24th by notifying the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Mexico denied the allegation on 30 August; but it refused to comply with the request of U.S. President Coolidge on 15 September to impose an embargo on arms and ammunition destined for Nicaragua.  Chamorro resigned on 30 October because of continued U.S. nonrecognition. His successor, Adolfo Diaz, elected by the Nicaragua Congress on 11 November as an interim leader pending a national election, was recognized by Washington on 17 November. However, Juan Sacasa, the Liberal Vice President under Chamorro who had fled Nicaragua, returned on 2 December, was proclaimed President by Liberal supporters, and was recognized by Mexico on 7 December.  U.S. marines returned to Nicaragua in December 1926, ostensibly to protect U.S. and other foreign citizens and property. They also assisted the Diaz regime in the civil war. Nonetheless, the Liberal forces behind Sacasa continued to advance, leading Washington on 5 January 1927 to lift the embargo on arms sales to Nicaragua. This was followed by an arms agreement with Diaz on 25 February 1927.  U.S. policy throughout Nicaragua's civil war was to undermine Mexico's competing influence in Central America. Its decisive intervention in the crisis was the dispatch of presidential envoy Henry L. Stimson to Nicaragua on 31 March with instructions to mediate and end the civil war. Using shuttle diplomacy, Stimson was able to get both factions to agree on all points except the continuation of Diaz as President. On 4 May Stimson achieved an agreement: Diaz was to complete his term of office; the Liberal rebels, led by José Maria Moncada, were to disarm; and the U.S. would supervise the 1928 presidential election. The next day an amnesty was declared. And on 15 May Stimson wrote to Secretary of State Kellogg that the civil war was over. For Nicaragua the assurance of a continuing U.S. military presence eliminated fears of further Mexican exploitation of civil strife thereby ending its foreign policy crisis.  There were many involved actors in Nicaragua's civil war of 1926-27. Offers to mediate by Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador were declined. The U.S., as noted, was highly involved, militarily and politically, serving as the crucial agent of crisis management. The U.K. sent a warship in February 1927 to evacuate British citizens. And the League of Nations' Secretary-General dispatched a fact-finding mission in response to Nicaragua's Note of 24 August 1926 regarding Mexico's intervention; but there was no further League activity. The Pan American Union was not involved in this crisis.
Yugoslavia, Albania, and Italy were enmeshed in a crisis from 28 November 1926 until 22 November 1927. From the outset Italy and Yugoslavia had competed for influence over Albania, both regarding it as vital to their national security. Tension eased in 1924 with a Treaty of Friendship between them, the Pact of Rome. Albania was proclaimed a republic in January 1925. Its frontiers were fixed by a formal agreement among the most interested major and regional powers--France, Greece, Italy, the U.K., and Yugoslavia--on 30 July 1926. Tension rose dramatically on 27 November 1926 with the signing of the Treaty of Tirana by Italy and its Albanian protégé, Ahmed Bey Zog (who became King of Albania in 1928). Italy was granted the right to dispatch troops to Albania if the latter was invaded, thereby making Albania a de facto Italian protectorate.  The Treaty of Tirana triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia the following day. Belgrade was slow to respond: in February 1927 it ordered a general reorganization of the army and tested its mobilization capability. In mid-March Albania became a crisis actor perceiving Komitadji rebels massing on its frontier as under the control of Yugoslavia. Albania responded by sending troops to the border. And Yugoslavia's testing of its mobilization system created a crisis for Italy on 17 March.  Italy's pledge of support if Albania was invaded, supplemented by minor troop movements to the island of Saseno, neutralized the perceived threat from Yugoslavia to Albania and terminated the latter's foreign policy crisis on 23 March. For Yugoslavia the crisis ended with the enhancement of its security through a Treaty of Friendship with France on 11 November designed to counter Italy's aggrandizement in southeast Europe. And Italy's crisis, along with the international crisis over Albania, ended with the second Treaty of Tirana on 22 November 1927 that created a defensive alliance between Italy and Albania. Yugoslavia (and France) acquiesced in this reassertion of Italian primacy.  The U.K., Germany, Czechoslovakia, and, later, Japan were involved politically through efforts to ease tensions between Italy and Yugoslavia. The League of Nations Council offered to mediate the conflict, but Italy declined.  (The "special relationship" between Albania and Italy forged by the two treaties of Tirana [1926, 1927] and their 20-year defensive military alliance [1927] marked the beginning of an Italian protectorate over Albania lasting until World War II.)
China and Japan were enmeshed in a two-stage crisis over the former's northern province of Shantung from 28 May 1927 until 28 March 1929. It was the first military-security crisis in their post-World War I protracted conflict. Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek advanced northward during the spring of 1927. Newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka perceived this as a danger to Japan's primary interest in mainland China, namely, the strategic and resource-rich northeast region of Manchuria. Thus on 20 May 1927 Japan's ambassador to China was instructed to offer moral support to Chiang in his attempt to suppress the communists. Moreover, inducements were offered to northern warlord, Chang Tso-lin, to concentrate his forces in Manchuria. Both steps were designed to ensure Japan's control over Manchuria. The potential collapse of Chang Tso-lin's forces led to the dispatch of Japanese troops to Tsinan on 28 May, triggering a crisis for China. The next day the nationalist Nanking regime protested Japan's action as a violation of the Sino/Japanese treaty of 1922 regarding China's sovereignty, triggering a crisis for Japan. Japanese forces landed at the port of Tsingtao on 31 May and began to march on Tsinan. On 1 June the Beijing government added its voice of protest on the same grounds.  A direct military confrontation between Japan and China was averted on this occasion: Japanese troops entered Tsinan on 16 June; and two days later Chiang's forces were defeated by Chang Tso-lin.  The result of Japan's incursion into Shantung was a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment in China including the boycott of Japanese goods. On 13 July the Beijing regime demanded the withdrawal of Japanese forces. On 29 August Tokyo announced its intended evacuation, which occurred on 8 September 1927, ending China's crisis and the first phase of the Shantung crisis.  In late December, following an inconclusive meeting between Chiang and Tanaka, rumors surfaced about a renewed northward offensive by China's nationalists: this alarmed Japanese decision makers, concerned about the implications for their goal of hegemony over Manchuria.  Boycotts of Japanese goods reappeared in China in March 1928. Early in April Chiang did, in fact, renew his advance northward. And on the 17th an antinationalist counterattack by Chang Tso-lin's forces failed. Two days later Japanese troops were dispatched from Tientsin to Tsinan, a response to a perceived escalation of the crisis: they arrived on the 20th. The Beijing regime immediately protested Japan's "show of force," as did the Nanking regime on the 21st. A minor skirmish between Japanese and Chinese troops was reported on the 30th, followed by a more serious confrontation at Tsinan on 3 May. A truce was arranged on the 5th. However, two days later a Japanese ultimatum called for the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Tsinan within 12 hours. When the deadline went unheeded hostilities resumed, and the Chinese were forced to evacuate the city on the 11th.  In the meantime both the Nanking and Beijing governments protested to the League of Nations, alleging a violation of China's territorial integrity and political independence. They offered to accept arbitration or an international inquiry; but the world body took no action.  Tension persisted, exacerbated by Tanaka's memorandum on 16 May asserting that Japan would use force to protect Manchuria from Chiang and Chang Tso-lin. Both Chinese regimes protested once more. Japanese troops remained in Tsinan throughout 1928. Serious negotiations began in October. A formal agreement was signed on 28 March 1929 providing for the withdrawal, once more, of Japanese forces from Tsinan. This ended Japan's crisis and the lengthy crisis over Shantung.  The U.S. alone among the powers with a stake in China was an involved actor: it offered good offices to both China and Japan to help end the fighting. The offer was declined; but the U.S. consul in Tsinan reportedly helped to wind down the hostilities.
Lithuania and Poland experienced another crisis over the long-disputed city of Vilna from mid-October to 10 December 1927. Poland's annexation of Vilna in 1922, following its self-supervised plebiscite, was rejected by Lithuania, which viewed itself in a state of war with Poland until 1927. Marshal Pilsudski returned to power in May 1926, first as Poland's Premier and Minister of War, later as President. He was a vocal advocate of a strong nationalist policy toward Vilna. A crisis for Lithuania was triggered in mid-October 1927 by the closure of Lithuanian schools and the arrest of Lithuanian teachers and priests in Poland, allegedly in retaliation for the persecution of Polish teachers in Lithuania. The renewed tension was accentuated by Poland's high-profile celebration in Vilna of the seventh anniversary of its occupation of the city, in the presence of General Zeligowski, who led the 1920 occupying army, and President Pilsudski.  Lithuania's response took the form of a Note to the League of Nations and a personal appearance by Premier Voldemaras before the League Council on 15 October, warning of the danger of war and the threat to Lithuania's independent existence. That dramatic act, in turn, created a crisis for Poland.  The great powers and the League Council did not take the threat to peace seriously: Lithuania's complaint was merely added to the agenda for the next regular Council session. France and the U.K. tried in vain to persuade Lithuania to withdraw its Note and to accept an offer of good offices. Poland declared that it would not use force to resolve the dispute over Vilna. The Soviet Union criticized Poland--and France--for seeking the former's annexation of Lithuania.  Pilsudski raised the tension level significantly just before the Council meeting in December by publicly criticizing Voldemaras and acknowledging that he had contemplated mobilizing Poland's armed forces with a view to invading Lithuania.  The crisis ended on 10 December, when the League Council, backed by the major powers, passed an omnibus resolution. Both parties were urged to declare an end to the state of war between them. Specifically, Dutch Foreign Minister Beelaerts van Blokland served as a mediator and induced both sides to an agreement that a state of war no longer existed. The Council called on Poland to recognize Lithuania's independence and territorial integrity. It established a committee to report on alleged mistreatment of Lithuanian nationals in Poland. And the two parties were requested to restore normal relations. The Soviet delegate, Litvinov, helped to persuade Lithuania's president to accept the package. And the leaders of Poland and Lithuania sealed the change in relations with a public handshake.  (Negotiations to resume normal relations began at the end of March 1928. Poland's continued occupation of Vilna remained a stumbling block. In March 1938 another crisis [see Case #61] led to Lithuania's acceptance of a Polish ultimatum to restore diplomatic relations or face an invasion.)
A crisis between Bolivia and Paraguay occurred between 5 December 1928 and 12 September 1929. The Chaco Boreal consists of 116,000 square miles of territory that had been claimed by Bolivia and Paraguay for 150 years. The area is mostly swamp, with very few inhabitants, and its agricultural or industrial value was as yet unexplored. It represented the only Bolivian access to the sea. Army patrols and forts were maintained by each state on its side of the Chaco. Notwithstanding agreements between Bolivia and Paraguay in 1913 and 1915, the dispute remained unresolved. A crisis for Bolivia was triggered on 5 December 1928 when Paraguayan troops captured and destroyed a Bolivian fort. The Bolivian government immediately severed diplomatic relations with Paraguay, mobilized its reserve forces, and, on 14 December, retaliated with a military attack to reoccupy the captured fort and occupy a second one. This triggered a crisis for Paraguay, which regarded Bolivia's military advance as a serious threat to its territory. On 17 December Paraguay proclaimed general mobilization and sent reinforcements north to halt what was believed to be an impending assault.  The adversaries seemed to be on the brink of a war that neither desired. Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations. But the prime mover in mediation was the Pan American Conference on Conciliation and Arbitration, a body that had been organized by the Pan American Union, a predecessor of the Organization of American States (OAS). The conference was composed of representatives from the U.S., Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay, as well as the two crisis actors. Of the participants in the neutral five-nation committee, the U.S. was the most active in the crisis and even offered its good offices on 14 December, before the Conference began its mediation efforts. The activities of the Conference led to a Conciliation Protocol signed in Washington on 3 January 1929. It called for a restoration of the status quo ante and the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two states, and set up a commission of inquiry. A proposed arbitration convention on 31 August 1929 was rejected by both parties. The crisis ended on 12 September 1929 when Bolivia and Paraguay ratified a resolution presented by the commission.  (The status quo as of December 1928 was restored on 4 April 1930, but no effort had been made to resolve the basic territorial dispute. The issue erupted again in 1932 [see Case #41--Chaco II].)  The League of Nations Council warned the two parties against further military activity and urged them to resolve the dispute peacefully. However, its mediation effort yielded to the Pan American Conference when the Pan American Union took up the matter. The United States was the most important contributor to crisis abatement, along with other members of the Pan American Union.
A crisis between the USSR and China over the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) began on 10 July and ended on 22 December 1929. Under the terms of a Sino-Russian secret treaty in 1896, China consented to the construction and operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway across Manchuria by the Russian-controlled Russo-Chinese bank. In 1924 an agreement was signed between the USSR and China for the joint management of the CER. During the next three years the Soviets assumed near-total management of the vital railway, and proposals by the Chinese to alter the situation were rejected. Relations between the two states were strained, and an incident in 1927 in which the Soviet embassy in Peking (Beijing) was searched did not improve matters. In addition, Chinese Communist activities in the railway zone were facilitated by Soviet diplomatic channels.  On 27 May 1929 the Chinese raided the Soviet consulate in Harbin, arresting several of its officers and railway employees. Documents seized at the time were published in the Chinese press and pointed to Soviet interference in China. The provincial government, acting in the railway area on the authority of China's national government, ordered the takeover of the CER and assumed its management, occupied USSR institutions, and arrested Soviet railway officials and citizens. A formal protest by Moscow on 31 May included demands for the immediate release of prisoners and the return of documents and property that, if not met, would incur the withdrawal of diplomatic privileges to Chinese personnel in the Soviet Union. On 10 July 1929 a crisis was triggered for the USSR: Chinese Nationalists, in cooperation with Marshal Chang Hseuh-liang, the ruler of Manchuria, seized the Chinese Eastern Railway, arresting a number of Russian administrators of the railway and closing their offices. The Soviet ambassador responded with an ultimatum on the 13th demanding the full restoration of the status quo ante vis-à-vis the CER. The Chinese were given three days to respond and to agree to a conference to settle problems involving the railway. Perceiving a threat to its political regime, China responded to the crisis with counterdemands on 16 July. Moscow broke off diplomatic relations on the 19th and sent troops to the border. Military preparations were also made by the Chinese, who published a manifesto alleging Soviet transgressions of the 1924 agreement. Meetings between the Soviet consul in Harbin and Chinese officials took place on 24 and 28 July and 2 August. Soviet raids into Chinese territory occurred throughout the discussions. When proposals advanced by each side were rejected by the other, the crisis escalated to violence.  On 12 August Soviet troops occupied three strategic towns in China near the border. Six thousand Chinese troops were mobilized on the 15th. Serious clashes occurred. By late December the Soviet advance threatened Harbin. Under duress, China signed a protocol on 22 December 1929 capitulating to Moscow's demands. This terminated both parties' foreign policy crises and the international crisis over the Chinese Eastern Railway.  Germany approached the Soviet Union on China's behalf in August and offered its good offices to settle the dispute. In October German attempts to conciliate were once more unsuccessful. During the crisis the United States, Britain, and France sent Notes to both belligerents requesting a halt to military activities. China responded favorably, but the USSR refused any third party intervention. A Japanese recommendation for talks at the local level, too, failed to produce any results.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for both China and Japan began on 18 September 1931 and ended on 18 February 1932. On 5 May 1931 a People's National Convention in Nanking adopted a provisional constitution that confirmed the separation of five branches within the Chinese government. Chinese nationalism had penetrated into China's three northeastern provinces, and authority in all of China was fragmented.  Unrest and dissatisfaction with economic conditions in Japan were marked by 1930: the military, while opposing the alliance between government and business, began to assume control. Strong pressure was brought to bear on the government to act positively in defense of Japanese interests in Manchuria, threatened by the policies of the Chinese nationalists. Manchuria was perceived, in part, as an economic panacea. On the night of 18 September 1931 the Japanese Kwantung Army, engaged in night maneuvers at Mukden, used an explosion on the railway as an excuse for the preconceived seizure, before morning, of the arsenal and of Antung, Yingkow, and Changchun. This triggered a crisis for China and also for the Japanese government--the invasion being an act by the Japanese army without previous sanction by the civil authority, which was not interested at that time in war with China. China had no choice but to withdraw after serious clashes. On 21 September Kirin was seized. The same day, China appealed to the League of Nations and to the U.S. for aid. No serious military response was attempted. On the 24th the Japanese government called for direct Sino/Japanese negotiations, while rejecting involvement by the League. At the same time Japanese military pressure continued, and the northeastern provinces of China were steadily occupied. The Chinese instituted a boycott of Japanese imports into the country.  The crisis ended for Japan and, by force majeure, for China on 18 February 1932, when Japan unilaterally declared the independence of Manchuria, now called Manchukuo. (China did not regain Manchuria until the end of World War II.) The League of Nations adopted a resolution on 10 December 1931 to dispatch a fact-finding mission.  (After the end of the crisis the Lytton Commission gently chided Japan: it found that the Japanese action of 18-19 September 1931 was not in self-defense and that the creation of Manchukuo did not flow from a "genuine and spontaneous independence movement." The Commission's criticism of Japan's behavior was adopted by the League Assembly, leading to Japan's notice of withdrawal from the League in February 1933.)  The United States condemned Japan's behavior but confined its action to nonrecognition of Manchukuo. Japan viewed the U.S. with hostility and suspicion, while China was dissatisfied with the paucity of the U.S. response. The USSR proposed a nonaggression pact to Japan. Territory previously recognized by Japan to be in the Soviet sphere of influence was now included in Manchukuo as the new state expanded its borders; but Moscow assumed Chinese rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway, which proved to be a continuing source of friction. The U.K. was modestly involved.
A Sino/Japanese crisis over Shanghai occurred from 24 January to 5 May 1932. At the beginning of the 1930s relations between foreigners and local Chinese authorities were fairly amicable in the "treaty port" of Shanghai. When news of the Japanese takeover in Manchuria reached Shanghai, anti-Japanese sentiment increased markedly. The Chinese, in retaliation, had staged a boycott of Japanese goods, and some Japanese residents in Shanghai were molested. During the first three weeks of January 1932 a number of violent incidents took place.  On 18 January some Japanese residents of Shanghai were attacked by Chinese. Five Japanese demands were presented to the Chinese mayor of Greater Shanghai, who claimed he was ready to comply with three of these, dealing directly with the incident, but not with the two involving the anti-Japanese movement. The commander of the Japanese fleet in Chinese waters threatened to take direct action; Japanese naval reinforcements were ordered to Shanghai. Twenty thousand Japanese troops arrived on 24 January 1932. A crisis for China was triggered on 24 January, when the Japanese notified Mayor Wu T'ieh-ch'eng that, if no reply was forthcoming within a reasonable time or if the reply was unsatisfactory, the Japanese government reserved the right to take action by 28 January. The Municipal Council of the International Settlement in Shanghai held a meeting on the 28th and declared a state of emergency. Despite the complete acceptance of all Japanese demands on the 28th, military operations began. This was met with Chinese armed resistance.  A crisis for Japan occurred on 29 January, when Admiral Shiuzawa concluded that the Japanese forces were inadequate to deal with the developing situation. An aerial bombardment of densely populated sections of the city was ordered, and additional troops were requested from Tokyo. This was approved by a cabinet decision on 4 February. Japan's major response, on 18 February, was an ultimatum requiring the Chinese to withdraw all their troops from Shanghai within two days. The Chinese refused. A Japanese attack followed.  Conditions for a cease-fire were initiated by the U.K. and were agreed to by the adversaries on 28 February, but fighting continued until 3 March, when the Chinese withdrew beyond the 20-kilometer limit upon which the Japanese had insisted.  At China's request, a special session of the League Assembly was held on 3 March to consider the Shanghai incident. On the 11th, a resolution was passed that reaffirmed the doctrine of nonrecognition of situations achieved in violation of treaty obligations. The U.S., too, condemned Japan.  It was largely through British mediation that an agreement between China and Japan was negotiated and an armistice signed on 5 May 1932, establishing a demilitarized zone around Shanghai and terminating the economic boycott. This ended the Shanghai crisis.
A second crisis over Chaco between Paraguay and Bolivia began on 18 June 1932 and lasted until 12 June 1935. The issue of ownership of the vast undeveloped Chaco region remained in dispute since the crisis of 1928-29 (see Case #37). During the intervening years there were some incidents, but no serious fighting took place. On 11 November 1931 negotiations between the adversaries began on the question of a settlement of their territorial differences. A draft nonaggression pact was under consideration when the second crisis broke out. A Bolivian attack and occupation of a fort were reported on 18 June 1932 to the headquarters of the chief of the Paraguayan General Staff. On 15 July Paraguay responded with an attack on a Bolivian fort built after the 18 June incident. Three days later the loss of the fort was reported, triggering a crisis for Bolivia, which perceived a threat to its political regime. Bolivia responded during the night of 18 July by holding a special emergency cabinet meeting where the president ordered a major reprisal and the immediate capture of the areas of Corralo and Toledo. This was done on 27 and 28 July, and Boqueron was occupied by Bolivian forces on 31 July 1932.  A Paraguayan counterattack during August 1932 succeeded in recapturing these forts and also pushed the Bolivian army back several miles from the positions held prior to the outbreak of the crisis. A Bolivian counterattack occurred during November and December 1932.  On 10 May 1933 Paraguay declared war. A truce was proposed in December 1933, but on 6 January 1934 fighting resumed. On 17 November 1934 the Paraguayans captured a principal Bolivian supply base.  Paraguay had appealed to the League of Nations Council in 1932, under Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant. With U.S. approval, the Council sent a commission of inquiry. When a truce broke down, Bolivia appealed to the League under Article 15. The dispute was transferred to the 15th Session of the League Assembly in November 1934, and an inquiry committee was formed to prepare a report. Its recommendations were the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal and demobilization of armies, temporary policing of the evacuated zone, and neutral arbitration. They were accepted by Bolivia and rejected by Paraguay.  On 16 January 1935 the advisory committee of the Assembly unanimously adopted a recommendation to League members to lift their arms embargo on Bolivia but to maintain it against Paraguay. Paraguay announced its intention to leave the League on 23 February, and the next day the recommendations went into effect.  Paraguay occupied most of the Chaco in a series of military campaigns. But military advantage began to swing in Bolivia's favor. The final phase of the negotiations for an armistice in the Chaco began on 27 May 1935 when Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and the United States began negotiations with the now exhausted states of Bolivia and Paraguay over a new protocol based upon the League of Nations' recommendations, with some modifications to pacify Paraguay. This mediation effort began after both sides exhausted most military options, which contributed to the relative success of this instance of mediation as contrasted to previous mediation attempts. An agreement was reached on 9 June and signed on 12 June 1935, ending the crisis for both actors. The agreement provided for the cessation of hostilities and the holding of a peace conference. About 90,000 soldiers died in South America's deadliest war of the twentieth century.  President Roosevelt issued a proclamation on 28 May 1934 prohibiting the sale of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. This was eventually agreed to by France, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the U.K.  Mediation was attempted by the neutral Commission of Washington (Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, and the U.S.); by the ABCP group (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru); and by the united efforts of all the neutral American states of the Pan American Conference at Montevideo in December 1933.  (Peace was not formally restored until 10 July 1938 and was approved by a plebiscite on 10 August. The peace treaty provided for arbitration of the boundaries. An arbitral award, by six American presidents, on 10 October 1938, gave most of the Chaco territory to Paraguay, along with an outlet to the sea via the Paraguay River for Bolivia.)
A crisis for Colombia and Peru over Leticia began on 8 September 1932 and terminated on 25 May 1933. The frontier between Colombia and Peru was in dispute until 1922 when the Salomon-Lozano Treaty was signed by the two states. The agreement provided that Peru recognize Colombian sovereignty over the Leticia Trapeze--a narrow strip of territory running from the Putumayo River to the Amazon.  During the night of 31 August-l September 1932 a group of armed Peruvians attacked and occupied the river port of Leticia, the capital of the Colombian district of the Amazon. Colombian troops were dispatched to repel the "aggressors." Peru denied responsibility for the attack, citing communists and enemies of the Peruvian government as having carried out the incursion. However, rumors of Peruvian President Sanchez Cerro's support for the seizure, as well as for a revision of the Salomon-Lozano Treaty, began to spread. On 8 September 1932 the U.S. ambassador to Colombia reported to the State Department that Colombian President Olaya perceived the possibility of war with Peru over the latter's support for the occupiers of Leticia. With a view to restoring its control over Leticia, Colombia responded in early September 1932 by sending a small naval expedition to retake the territory. The expedition had to pass through the Panama Canal and then 2,000 miles up the Amazon River. On 22 September the government of Colombia issued a special loan for national defense. During November Ecuador sent a Note to the League of Nations about the conflict between Colombia and Peru.  On 27 December 1932 the Colombian expedition arrived at the mouth of the Amazon River, triggering a crisis for Peru. At that time Peruvian reinforcements were reported to be assembling near Leticia. Colombia formally asked for League of Nations intervention on 2 January 1933 and again requested a special session on the 21st.  On 6 February General Victor Ramos, commander of the Peruvian forces, cabled a warning to the Colombian consul in Lima stating that the entry of the Colombian flotilla into the Amazon was a hostile act and he had therefore ordered military measures to prevent its arrival at Leticia. Following a request by the commander of the Colombian expedition to allow him to occupy Tarpaca peacefully, Peru bombed the Colombian gunboats on 14 February 1933. Tarpaca was captured the following day by Colombian forces.  During March and April Colombian troops captured several Peruvian posts. The assassination of President Cerro in Peru on 30 April decreased the possibility of further military clashes. On 2 May direct negotiations began between the new Peruvian President, Benavides, and his close personal friend, Alfonso Lopez, a leader of the Liberal Party in Colombia, who was to become its President the following year. On the 10th the League Council's advisory committee submitted a new proposal, and on 25 May 1933 an agreement was signed by representatives of Colombia and Peru, transferring control of Leticia from the Peruvian forces to a League of Nations commission of three (Brazil, Spain, and the U.S.) for one year, terminating the crisis for both actors.  The League of Nations played a crucial role in crisis abatement. The Council discussed the Leticia issue on 24 and 26 January 1933 and sent Notes to both parties. On 13 March it unanimously adopted a report calling on Peru to withdraw all its forces from Leticia and all support from Peruvian occupiers of Colombia's territory--as a prelude to negotiations on Peru's grievances. (Both parties rejected arbitration.) Through direct submission of proposals and the use of sanctions against Peru, the League effectively mediated in the crisis and contributed to the abatement of hostilities. The Council also appointed an advisory committee to monitor the crisis. Its new proposals, submitted on 10 May, proved to be the basis of negotiations between the adversaries, leading to the agreement of 25 May. (Moreover, the League Commission administered the disputed territory for a year. Leticia was transferred to Colombia in June 1934, following a treaty between the two parties on 24 May 1934.)  The U.S. responded to a Colombian appeal by sending a Note to Peru requesting that it allow the restoration of Colombian control over Leticia. Later, in March 1933, the U.S. participated in the deliberations of the League of Nations Advisory Committee. The U.K. also applied pressure, mostly on Peru, to cooperate with the League. Brazil tried to mediate, unsuccessfully.
China's crisis over the province of Jehol lasted from 23 February to 31 May 1933. The creation of the State of Manchukuo by Japan in 1932 (see Case #39--Mukden Incident) included the territory of China's three northeastern provinces, Jehol, and parts of Inner Mongolia. The Japanese-Manchukuon forces had been operating to clear the area of all anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo Chinese pockets in Jehol. In order to resist Japanese advances, China resolved to concentrate troops south of the Great Wall at various points in the province of Jehol in December 1932. Despite Japan's repeated warning, three Chinese brigades were moved to Jehol. Japanese forces occupied Shanhaikwan on 3 January 1933 to provide a preliminary base for the expected occupation of Jehol. A state of extreme tension prevailed in China, but the Chinese military remained confident of its ability to halt a Japanese advance in Jehol. On 23 February 1933 the Japanese issued an ultimatum calling for the evacuation of all Chinese troops from Jehol and warning that no guarantees could be given that military hostilities would not spread to North China. That day 30,000 Japanese and 1,000 Manchukuon troops launched an attack on Jehol. The ultimatum was rejected the next day by the Chinese, who moved more troops to the area. Jehol fell on 4 March to the Japanese, and by May they had advanced to within three kilometers of Beijing. On 31 May 1933 the Chinese government signed a truce at Taugku, in accordance with which Chinese forces withdrew west of Beijing and the Japanese undertook to stay north of the Great Wall. This ended the Jehol crisis.  During March 1933 the U.K., France, and the U.S. were informed that China would not negotiate with Japan and that resistance was its legitimate right as a member of the League of Nations. In February recommendations had been submitted by the League, but China felt that they did not go far enough in sanctioning Japan and withdrew its request. The British then refused to mediate. The U.S. was approached in May; President Roosevelt issued a noncommittal statement. Italy strongly condemned Japan. Plans for joint efforts by Italy, the U.S., and the U.K. to end the fighting in northern China never came to fruition.
A crisis between Sa'udi Arabia and Yemen over territory began on 18 December 1933 and ended on 20 May 1934. In 1930 the former protectorate of 'Asir was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hijaz and Najd (later, Sa'udi Arabia), thus extending its territory to the Yemen border. The imam of Yemen then claimed a number of frontier districts between the two states. Tribes residing in 'Asir, aided by Yemen, staged a revolt against King Ibn Sa'ud. Treaties of friendship had been signed between Sa'udi Arabia and Great Britain, and between Yemen and Italy. On 18 December 1933 the Sa'udis received information that Yemeni troops had entered Asir. That day Sa'udi Arabia decided to initiate talks with Yemen. A conference was convened on 16 March 1934, but Yemen refused to withdraw from the disputed area. The Sa'udis opted for military action and, on 22 March 1934, ordered troops into 'Asir. This triggered a crisis for Yemen. Sa'udi troops advanced into the disputed highland and along Yemen's coastal plain, to the port of Hudeida. British, French, and Italian warships were sent to the area, and their combined political and military pressure succeeded in halting the first Saudi advance.  Yemen resisted the Sa'udi assault at first, but, on 12 April, the imam cabled Ibn Sa'ud requesting peace and announcing that his troops had been ordered to evacuate 'Asir. Fighting continued during the talks on the terms of the armistice, assisted by a conciliation commission of Egyptians and Syrians. On 13 May 1934 Sa'udi Arabia officially announced an armistice: the imam had agreed to carry out the Sa'udi conditions. A peace conference began on 18 May, and on 20 May the crisis ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ta'if, which recognized Sa'udi Arabia's sovereignty over all of 'Asir, including the oasis of Najran, the initial source of the dispute, and called for financial reparations from Yemen, in return for the withdrawal of Sa'udi forces from Yemeni territory.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.  (This long-standing border dispute over the districts of 'Asir, Jizan, and Najran generated another crisis between Sa'udi Arabia and Yemen in January-February 1995: Yemen reopened a claim to these territories which it acknowledged in a border agreement in 1973 had rightly been annexed by Sa'udi Arabia. However, unlike in 1933-34 the clashes occurred at many points along the Sa'udi Arabia/Yemen border. On 26 February 1995 they announced that a joint committee would demarcate the largely undefined 2,000-kilometer boundary.)
The crisis over the attempted putsch (plot to overthrow the government) in Austria occurred between 25 and 31 July 1934. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Yugoslavia were crisis actors. Chancellor Dollfuss began ruling Austria by emergency decrees in March 1932 and built his dictatorship on the anti-Nazi and anti-marxist principles of the Heimwehr (Home Guard) militia. All elections were prohibited after the Nazis won nine of the 20 seats in the Innsbruck municipality. In May 1933 about 100 Austrian Nazis were arrested at a political demonstration. A Nazi campaign of terror led to the formal suppression of the Austrian Nazi Party, the NSDAP. The party went underground. Germany's aggressive policy toward Austria increased in the summer of 1933. Dollfuss's efforts to secure support abroad succeeded in acquiring moral and financial support for Vienna from France and the U.K. His appeal to his patron, Mussolini, led to an Italian warning to Hitler on 5 August and subsequent assurances of Italian support. A series of provocative German broadcasts directed at Austria were initiated from the Bavarian capital. Italy, France, and Britain sent representatives to Berlin to discuss the cessation of German subversive activity in Austria, with partial success, although the broadcasts continued. On 11 August 1933 there was a shooting incident on the Austro-German frontier. On the 14th alleged documents of the Austrian Nazi Party were published, but their authenticity was denied by the Party. On 3 October there was an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Dollfuss. Attempts at reconciliation between Austria and Germany did not produce results.  On 12 February 1934 the headquarters of the Socialist Party in Linz was stormed. A strike by the electrical workers paralyzed Austria. Arrests of most of the Socialist leaders followed. Three days of heavy fighting between the Heimwehr and the Socialists followed. Martial law was proclaimed, together with the dissolution of the Socialist Party, trade unions, and all affiliated organizations. On 1 May the Austrian cabinet declared a new constitution: the country would henceforth be ruled by the clerical fascists of the Heimwehr. Dollfuss assumed the portfolios of public security, foreign affairs, and war, apart from the chancellorship. Hitler and Mussolini met in Venice on 14 June to discuss the Austrian question. On 12 July the Austrian cabinet decreed the death penalty for unauthorized possession of explosives following discovery that a new supply of arms was pouring across the German border. A Czechoslovakian worker was beaten and hung by the police in Vienna on the 24th. A cabinet meeting was rescheduled for the following day. On 25 July 1934 Austrian Nazis attacked the chancery and killed Dollfuss, triggering a crisis for Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Italy. Austria's response, the same day, was to repress the rebellion and arrest participating members of the SS unit. The vice-chancellor took charge of the government. Two days later Czechoslovakia, fearing that a German invasion of Austria would lead to an Italian invasion as well, threatened to move troops in the direction of Vienna to protect its own territory. Italy, determined to prevent an anschluss (union) of Austria with Germany, responded immediately by rushing troops to the border at the Brenner Pass on 25 July and by warning Hitler that, if the Germans invaded Austria, Italy would cross that border. At that time Dollfuss's family was in Italy, as Mussolini's guests, and were awaiting the chancellor's arrival on the 27th.  The Italian response of 25 July triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia, which had a long-standing dispute with Italy over Carinthia. Italian troops at the Brenner Pass constituted a serious security problem for Yugoslavia. Its response, that day, was a threat to move forces, mobilization, the strengthening of frontier guards, and the movement of some troops to the Moribor area on the Yugoslav/Austrian border.  The crisis ended for Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Italy on 31 July, by which time the Austrian militia had completed the suppression of Nazi uprisings that had belatedly broken out in the provinces. Yugoslavia's crisis ended that day as well, as a result of Italy's decision not to send troops into Austria. Germany's decision to pull back from an attempted anschluss constituted a tacit agreement with Italy not to take such action then or later without the latter's approval.  France, the U.K., and Germany were involved actors. The first two feared a war in Europe as a consequence of a successful putsch, while Hitler decried its failure, fearing Western blame for the attempt and not being militarily prepared as yet for a showdown with Britain and France.  There was no League of Nations activity in this crisis.
The international crisis that followed the assassination of Yugoslavia's King Alexander began on 8 October and ended on 10 December 1934. The crisis actors were Yugoslavia and Hungary. In 1921 King Alexander became the ruler of the Croatian, Serbian, and Slovene peoples. In 1929 he proclaimed a royal dictatorship and changed the name of the state to Yugoslavia. A new constitution was proclaimed in 1931, based on the will of the Serbs and the suppression of the minority Croats and Slovenes. Croatian refugees fled to Italy, Bulgaria, and especially Hungary where they organized terrorist acts against Alexander's tyranny. The attempt to halt the movement of terrorists led to shooting and border incidents between Yugoslavia and Hungary. Alexander accused Hungary of giving aid to Yugoslavia's enemies. Budapest denied the allegation and brought the Croatian claim before the League of Nations. French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou extended an invitation to King Alexander to visit Paris in October 1934. He wished to confer with the monarch on future policies toward Austria and Italy. On 8 October 1934, hours after King Alexander reached Marseilles, he and Louis Barthou were killed by a Macedonian assassin bearing a Hungarian passport. This triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia. Leaders of the Croatian terrorist organization were arrested in Italy at the French government's request, but Rome refused to extradite them to France or allow for their interrogation. Anti-Italian demonstrations broke out in Yugoslav towns. The Quai d'Orsay (a synonym for France's foreign ministry), on the eve of a Franco-Italian rapprochement, persuaded Yugoslavia to minimize the evidence of Italian complicity and to concentrate its anger on Hungary.  The delayed Yugoslav response, and the crisis trigger for Hungary, was a Yugoslav appeal to the League of Nations on 22 November, alleging that the assassins had been selected at Janka Puszta and had left Hungary freely with Hungarian passports. Budapest denied most of the charges in its response of 24 November. (Hungary had first approached the League Council, on 12 May, complaining of conditions on the frontiers of the two states.)  Threats of war passed, but feelings between the two countries were bitter and angry. A report was presented to the League affirming that certain Hungarian authorities had, at least by negligence, failed to prevent and repress political terrorism, with the result that the task of the assassins had been facilitated. Hungary was asked to make further investigations and report the result. The League discussions ended with a resolution requesting Hungary to "take at once appropriate punitive action in the case of any of its authorities whose culpability may have been established" and to report back to the Council. A commission of experts was set up to study the possibility of an international convention to discourage terrorism. The crisis terminated on 10 December 1934 when both states accepted the League resolution.  (In December, too, Belgrade initiated a brutal eviction of several thousand innocent Hungarian peasants from its territory but stopped when indignant protests were issued from abroad. In January 1935 Hungary informed the Council that a detailed investigation had disclosed no official responsibility for the Marseilles crime.)
One of the celebrated international crises of the inter-world war period, Ethiopian War, began on 6 December 1934 and lasted until 5 May 1936. There were four crisis actors: Ethiopia, the U.K., France, and Italy. Italy's entry into East Africa as a colonial power in the late nineteenth century was made possible by a British objective of reducing French influence in the region. Italian expansion continued until their severe defeat by Abyssinian (Ethiopian) troops at the Battle of Adowa in 1896. Eritrea was transferred to Italy by British royal decree in 1899. Mussolini's efforts to achieve domination over Ethiopia began as early as 1923. In 1928 a Treaty of Friendship was signed; but Ethiopia refused to live up to its conditions, which granted Italy special privileges. In 1932 Mussolini sent his minister of the colonies to Eritrea to prepare it as a springboard for an invasion of Ethiopia. Thereafter roads and military installations in Eritrea were built and strengthened. Incidents occurred on the border as the Ethiopians became more and more apprehensive of Italy's designs. Wal-wal (Ual-ual), a watering site in a loosely designated border area between Italian and Ethiopian territory, had been used frequently by tribes from British and Italian Somaliland who wandered freely in the area. It became the site of an Italian garrison. In November 1934 a British mission surveying the border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia arrived at the wells of Wal-wal with an armed Ethiopian escort. The Italian garrison commander perceived an imminent attack from tribesmen nearby and requested reinforcements, while the British mission withdrew from the area. On 6 December 1934 Mussolini demanded an unconditional apology, a large indemnity, and punishment of those responsible for an attack by Ethiopian tribesmen against the Italians at Wal-wal the previous day. This triggered a crisis for Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, who claimed that the dispute fell under the arbitration clause of the 1928 Treaty of Friendship. The U.K. proposed a conciliatory solution that Italy refused to consider.  Ethiopia appealed to the League of Nations on 9 December. When no progress was forthcoming it requested League intervention on 3 January 1935. The Council encouraged direct negotiations between the parties and, later, arbitration. The item was removed from the Council's agenda when Italy agreed to bilateral talks. However, negotiations began to break down in March in the face of new preconditions by Italy and the buildup of its forces in Eritrea. On 17 March and 3 April there were two more Ethiopian appeals to the League.  France and the U.K. supported Italy's view that the League should await the outcome of pending arbitration. (In an earlier Franco-Italian agreement, 7 January, Paris gave Rome a free hand vis-à-vis Ethiopia. France, Italy, and the U.K. met on 11-14 April to form the Stresa Front against Germany. Italy then conceded that it would consent to arbitration with Ethiopia under the 1928 treaty. Further negotiations between the two adversaries and France and Great Britain centered around the 20 May 1935 League Council meeting, which adopted two resolutions on the timing and form of arbitration: 25 August was designated as the final date for a ruling. A U.K. offer of economic concessions to Italy amounting to economic control over Ethiopia and a large part of Ogaden, with an Ethiopian access to the sea through British Somaliland, was refused by Italy in June. The situation was further aggravated by the signing of an Anglo-German naval agreement in June, which allowed German naval expansion to 35 percent of the size of the British navy.  A three-power meeting without Ethiopian participation began in August 1935. Italy, which by then had assembled 250,000 troops in East Africa, rejected Anglo-French proposals and refused to state its final demands. Sometime during that month a U.K. perception that Mussolini might attack Britain in retaliation for its support of Ethiopia triggered a crisis for the U.K. (As early as January 1935 London had informed the emperor that "no assurances of even the most general and personal nature" could be given.)  In response to a perceived threat of possible war the U.K. reinforced its Mediterranean fleet on 3 September 1935. It also began negotiations with other Mediterranean states, especially Yugoslavia and Turkey. At the same time, the "Hoare-Laval Plan" (see below) ruled out Anglo-French military action against Italy. And the British foreign secretary assured Mussolini that the U.K. would not close the Suez Canal to Italian ships or impose economic sanctions.  In early September Ethiopia appealed to the Council once more, under Article 15 of the Covenant. On 9 September a League Committee of Five was appointed to discuss the dispute, as well as Italian claims that Ethiopia was unfit for League membership. League observers were requested to witness Italian mobilization and the forward movement of its troops. And when Ethiopia perceived war as imminent it informed the League on 29 September of its intention to mobilize.  On 3 October 1935 Italy, the triggering entity for the international crisis as a whole, began a full-scale attack on Ethiopia transforming the incipient crisis over Wal-wal into the Ethiopian War. In addition to military resistance the victim appealed to the League the following day. Mussolini justified the war, alleging Ethiopian "aggression." The League Council condemned Italian aggression on the 7th. And on the 11th the League Assembly called on members to impose sanctions against Italy.  France feared that strong League action might provoke Italy to leave the recently formed anti-German Stresa Front and realign with Germany. Thus the Council's action triggered a crisis for France. Premier Pierre Laval, who as Foreign Minister had negotiated the January 1935 carte blanche deal with Italy, attempted to slow down the imposition of sanctions by a special League Committee of Thirteen, which had been set up on 9 October to draft specific measures. Its recommendations, issued on 6 November, triggered a crisis for Italy because they included sanctions on oil imports, as well as other vital raw materials. Italy responded in early December by informing France's premier that such League action would seriously affect Franco-Italian relations.  Laval took measures to stall the imposition of oil sanctions and succeeded in preventing their adoption, preferring a compromise agreement between the adversaries. U.K. Foreign Secretary Hoare and Laval began talks on 7 December. The result was the Hoare-Laval Plan announced on 9 December. The plan called for three areas of Ethiopia bordering Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to be ceded to Italy, and a large section of southern Ethiopia to be set aside for exclusive Italian exploitation. Ethiopia was to receive a corridor to the sea and the port of Assab in Eritrea.  The plan was uncovered by the press in Britain and published even before it was proposed to the belligerents. The subsequent backlash resulted in Hoare's resignation on 18 December 1935 and the fall of the Laval government in France on 22 January 1936. On 3 March the new French premier was able to thwart the final attempt to impose oil sanctions against Italy in favor of an appeal to the belligerents for conciliation.  Once the threat of effective League action was over, the crises for Italy, France, and the U.K. ended. Hitler's reoccupation of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 (see Case #51--Remilitarization of the Rhineland, in France/Germany PC) diverted League attention from Italy. Meanwhile war raged in Ethiopia and escalated with the Italian use of mustard gas, despite League disapproval. Ethiopia appealed to the League, to other states, and to the world at large throughout April 1936. On 2 May Haile Selassie fled into exile through French Somaliland. On 5 May the capital, Addis Ababa, fell to Italy's forces; and Mussolini announced the end of the war and Italy's annexation of Ethiopia.  (The League Assembly lifted the sanctions against Italy in July 1936 and refused to recognize its conquest of Ethiopia. The United States passed the Second Neutrality Act on 29 February 1936 in response to the recommendations for oil sanctions against Italy.)
A two-stage non-violent crisis between Bulgaria and Turkey occurred between 6 March and 31 August 1935. On 8 February 1934 the Balkan Pact was signed by Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia: it provided mutual guarantees for the security of their borders; and each promised not to take action regarding any Balkan nonsignatory without previous discussions. Bulgaria had long refused to recognize the status quo established by the post-World War I peace treaties. On 1 March 1935 the followers of Venizelos in Greece staged an uprising in Athens, Macedonia, and Crete as a protest against royalism. Turkey began concentrating troops on its borders with Bulgaria and Greece. On 6 March Bulgaria's foreign minister expressed his country's alarm at the troop concentrations and complained of anti-Bulgarian propaganda in the Turkish press. Two days later Bulgaria responded with an aide-mémoire to the League of Nations charging Turkey with "aggression" and requesting League action, thereby triggering a crisis for Ankara. At a press conference Turkey denied unfriendly intentions, declared that its troop concentrations were directed at Greece, countercharged that there was a Bulgarian military buildup along the border, and affirmed its intent to maintain the status quo in the Balkans. This had the desired effect. On 10 March Bulgaria withdrew its memo from the League and asserted its peaceful intentions ending the first stage of this crisis for both actors.  Relations between Bulgaria and Turkey remained tense during the next five months. In March Kemal Atatürk was reelected President of Turkey for the next four years. Turkey continued its active policy of rearmament because of distrust of Italy's intentions in the eastern Mediterranean. In July the Turkish War Ministry ordered the fortification of Kirklareli near Bulgaria's southern border on the Black Sea. Bulgaria's nationalists desired an outlet to the Aegean Sea through the Turkish Gulf of Saros.  On 3 August 1935, as the Turkish fortifications at Kirklareli neared completion, Bulgaria's War Council met in emergency session and decided on immediate construction of strong permanent fortifications around the southern Bulgarian town of Haskovo. The Bulgarian perception of threat rose further when the Turkish army began carrying out maneuvers in Eastern Thrace near the border. On 23 August the Turkish minister to Bulgaria informed his government of the growing anxiety in Bulgaria regarding Turkish military maneuvers, especially in view of the fact that they were attended by all high-ranking Turkish officers. He also reported on the growing resentment at the anti-Bulgarian articles in the Turkish press. By 25 August the concentration of Turkish troops on the Bulgarian border was reported to have reached the strength of three army corps.  On 31 August, although half of the Turkish army was on maneuvers, the crisis ended with a visit to Sofia by Turkish Foreign Minister Aras resulting in a joint statement disapproving anti-Bulgarian attacks in the Turkish press.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
Lithuania's crisis with Germany over the Kaunas trials lasted from 28 March to 25 September 1935. The Versailles Treaty following World War I placed the city of Memel under Allied sovereignty. It was occupied by Lithuania in 1923, and the following year the League of Nations awarded Memel a special status under Lithuanian sovereignty. A dissatisfied Germany, which declared its intention to regain the city, was eagerly supported by Memel's German inhabitants. Parallel to the Nazi rise to power in Germany, Nazi and Nazi-front organizations became active in Lithuania. In 1934 an accusation of conspiracy against Lithuania was made against 122 Nazis who were tried in Kaunas. On 26 March 1935 they were found guilty. In response to the Kaunas trials Germany closed its border with Lithuania and imposed economic sanctions. This triggered a crisis for Lithuania on 28 March. Even before the trial had ended Memel police and border guards had been alerted to the possibility of an uprising or even an invasion. When Hitler urged the three guarantor powers (Britain, France, and Italy) to take action, they handed a protest note to Lithuania together with a threat to bring the issue to the League.  Tension reached its peak when, on 17 May, a Lithuanian appeals court upheld all the sentences except one. That day Germany moved its troops to the border, as did Lithuania while calling up reserve forces. During the period between May and September tension remained high, with Germany's repeated declarations of hostility. On 25 September elections were held in Memel, and their results led to a temporary reduction of tension. A détente between Germany and Lithuania was reached when the latter agreed to new amendments in its electoral laws.  The League of Nations played no role in this crisis.
The first crisis between Peru and Ecuador over the territory of the Marañón River basin lasted from 1 to 30 November 1935. On 1 November 1935 Ecuadorian cavalry and police invaded the Peruvian province of Tumbes. The following day Peru delivered a protest note to Ecuador. The Peruvian Congress met in secret session on 13 November. Peru's major response, on the 14th, was to send strong reinforcements, including infantry and planes, to its garrison in Tumbes. This triggered a crisis for Ecuador. Further protests were sent by Peru to Ecuador. The crisis terminated on 30 November when the Peruvian foreign minister announced that Ecuador had been invited to submit the question of the disputed territory to arbitration. Ecuador agreed. There was no League of Nations, OAS, or U.S. involvement in this crisis.
The international crisis over Germany's remilitarization of the Rhineland took place between 7 March and 16 April 1936. The actors were Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, Romania, the U.K., and Yugoslavia. The international status of the Rhineland, an area separating Germany from France and Belgium, had been determined at Versailles at the end of World War I, and in the Locarno Pact of 1 December 1925. Germany was forbidden to maintain or construct any fortifications either on the left bank of the Rhine or on the right bank to a line drawn 50 kilometers to the east of the river. The Locarno Pact pledged Germany, France, and Belgium to nonaggression and pacific settlement. It guaranteed established frontiers and the demilitarization of the Rhineland. If the Reich armed this demilitarized zone, France was legally authorized to declare it an unprovoked act of aggression, and Britain, Italy, and Belgium would all be bound to come at once to France's aid. France had secured itself by alliances with Poland and the Little Entente states (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) which had built their security against German aggressiveness upon these military alliances with France. The Germans claimed that France's 1935 military pact with the Soviet Union, exclusively directed against Germany, was a violation of the Locarno Pact. Hitler proceeded to fulfill his election promises when plans were laid for Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland. On 7 March 1936 three German battalions entered and occupied the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, triggering a crisis for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, Romania, the U.K., and Yugoslavia. The border countries, France and Belgium, had assumed since the end of World War I that the Rhineland would remain permanently demilitarized. Britain had formally obligated itself to protect them. Moreover, it had been a cornerstone of British foreign policy that a threat to France and Belgium was, by nature of their geographic proximity, also a threat to the U.K. The Little Entente states and Poland, which were now obliged to act in France's defense, perceived their own safety and security to be threatened in the event of France's collapse. Each actor in the Remilitarization of the Rhineland crisis sought a pacific solution that might condemn Germany overtly but at the same time allow for a negotiable settlement.  France responded immediately with a cabinet decision on 7 March to act through the League and consult the Locarno guarantors in order to achieve a German withdrawal; a military solution was rejected as too dangerous. Czechoslovakia also responded that day with a declaration to conform its attitude exactly to that of France in every contingency. The following day Romania and Yugoslavia responded more reticently: they suggested to France that a peaceful solution to the crisis be sought but refused to commit themselves in the event of a forceful confrontation with Germany or the imposition of economic sanctions. The British responded on 9 March with a cabinet decision to consult with Hitler, the Locarno powers, and the League Council in the hope of negotiating a coordinated compromise settlement. A military response and economic sanctions were rejected. On 10 March Belgium's response was contained in a statement by its prime minister that it would demand at least a partial restoration of the status quo. He intimated that economic sanctions should be used; but when it became clear that this was not viewed favorably by the other Locarno powers it was withdrawn. That day, too, Poland declared that the Franco-Polish treaty covered unprovoked aggression against France proper, and as the remilitarization of the Rhineland did not fall into that category it would not act forcefully in the present crisis or support economic sanctions against Germany.  Members of the League Council began meetings in London on 13 March. On the 19th all members of the Council except Germany endorsed a White Paper condemning German action in the Rhineland as a threat to European unity. The Council proposed the appointment of a committee to recommend measures to be adopted to safeguard peace. Tentative solutions were put forth concerning the partial withdrawal of German troops and the establishment of an international force in a new and narrow demilitarized zone of 20 kilometers between Germany, France, and Belgium. They were rejected outright by Hitler, who threatened that a punitive resolution by the League Council would be regarded by Germany as an unfriendly act. This specter of war, together with Italy's reluctance to cooperate and Germany's veto, finally paralyzed the League completely: the Council meeting dissolved on 23 March 1936, terminating the crisis for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The crisis for France and the U.K. lasted until 16 April as France continued to insist that Britain compensate it for the loss of security on its eastern border. On 2 April Britain agreed to hold staff talks with the French on 15 and 16 April. These talks concluded the punitive phase of the crisis; and from that point on no further demands were made directly to Berlin over the Rhineland issue.  Involved in the Remilitarization of the Rhineland crisis were the seven crisis actors, along with Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Italy, although a guarantor of the Locarno Pact, had moved away from the Western powers in the ensuing decade and had developed closer ties with Germany. The Soviet Union did not depend upon France's military strength for its security. Indeed Soviet decision makers perceived that, should the crisis lead to armed conflict, it would be located in Western Europe and would not affect the USSR. As for the U.S., Secretary of State Hull made it plain that he considered the Rhineland remilitarization to be a European development in which the United States was not involved.  A far-reaching effect of the Remilitarization of the Rhineland crisis on Belgium was the termination of the Franco-Belgian treaty of 1920 and Belgium's formal declaration of neutrality in October 1936. More generally, Hitler's first major gamble in international politics succeeded: the Versailles powers acquiesced, paving the way for Munich in 1938 (see Case #64, in Czechoslovakia/ Germany PC) and, the next year, the outbreak of World War II (see Case #74, in Multiregional PCs: World War II)
Spain experienced the first of four international crises during the long civil war, from 17 July 1936 to 18 March 1937. On 16 January 1936 a Popular Front was forged by the small Communist Party, the Socialists, the Left Republicans, the Republican Union, the Catalán Left, and the marxist POUM parties of Spain. The Anarcho-Syndicalists of Catalonia and Madrid did not join the Front, which was viewed by all conservatives and the church with alarm. The Popular Front was dominated by middle-class liberals, the communist elements adhering to a nonrevolutionary line. In the general elections a month later the Popular Front won 265 seats of a total of 473. President Alcalá Zamora was replaced by Manuel Azaña on 10 May 1936, but reform made slow progress. Strikes and anticlerical demonstrations prevailed. The Communists opposed immediate socialization of land and nationalization of industry in favor of a more disciplined evolution. The Socialists promoted a form of proletarian rule. The wealthy and the aristocracy saw symptoms of incipient social revolution and secretly mobilized to overthrow the Popular Front. In April 1936 Hans Hellermann became the leader of Spain's Nazi Party, which consisted largely of German nationals. By July moral and material help from Italy, Germany, and Portugal was being received regularly by fascist conspirators. The revolt was to begin in Spanish Morocco and move on the capital, Madrid. It began on 17 July. The uprising on the Spanish mainland began on 18 July 1936 and triggered a crisis for Republican Spain. The following day inquiries were made as to the scope of the rebellion; and orders were given to the remaining loyal troops in Spanish Morocco to resist. The Soviet Union was concerned that a fascist regime in Spain would change the European power balance to the USSR's detriment and Germany's and Italy's favor. Spain's major response to the internal military challenge was an order from newly appointed Prime Minister Giral y Pereira, on 19 July, to arm the CNT (trade union of the Anarchist Party) and the UGT (General Union of Workers, led by the Spanish Socialist Party, later under Communist control). Giral perceived that these unions formed the only possible effective resistance to the fascist (Falange) rebellion, which spread rapidly to one-third of the garrisons in north and northwest Spain but failed to gain support in the key cities--Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao. He ordered the trade unions to enter into active combat against the rebels, while appealing to Premier León Blum of France on 20 July to send arms and planes. That day General Franco took command of the Moors and Spain's Foreign Legion.  The death of General José Sanjurjo in a plane crash on the 20th left Generals Francisco Franco and Emilio Mola the two figures in command of the rebellion, Franco in the south and in Spanish Morocco, Mola in the north. Three days later "La Junta de la Defensa Nacional" was formed in Burgos as the executive body of the rebel movement. And on 29 September, two days after the rebel victory at Toledo--the Battle of Alcazar--the junta named Franco Head of Government and Generalíssimo of the Nationalists' land, sea, and air forces. (Mola was to die in a plane crash in June 1937.)  The initial rebel siege of Madrid from 7 November 1936 to 9 January 1937 and again in February failed. Málaga in the deep south fell to the rebels on 8 February. Most important was the Republican (Loyalist) victory at the Battle of Guadalajara on 18 March 1937, eliminating the pressure on Madrid and terminating Spain's first crisis of the civil war.  During the onset phase of that war three major powers and one small power were actively involved--Italy, Germany, and Portugal on the side of the rebels, the USSR supporting the Republican government. However, none perceived the conditions--threat, time pressure, higher likelihood of war--that would have qualified them as crisis actors. France and the U.K. took the lead in forming the Non-Intervention Committee, comprising most European states; and the U.S. remained aloof. (Spain's principal adversary throughout was a nonstate actor, namely, that segment of the Spanish army that rose in revolt against the Republic in July 1936.)  Initial contact by the rebels with Italy and Germany began in the first week of the uprising. Both pledged assistance within days, as did Portugal. Italy dispatched transport, aircraft, and military equipment in late July; and Germany sent the Condor Legion, with 100 planes, in November. And on the 28th Italy signed a secret treaty of friendship and assistance with the rebel leader.  The Soviets sent arms and equipment to the Republican government early in the war. It also played a key role in organizing the dispatch of International Brigades of volunteers to fight alongside the Loyalist forces, starting in October 1936.  France promised aid to the Republican government on 20 July but reneged five days later. And early in August it initiated a nonintervention plan, along with the U.K. It also suspended the export of all war materiel to Spain. The Non-Intervention Committee began regular meetings in London in September 1936, formally supported by all European states. However, it was undermined by Italy's and Germany's recognition of the Franco-led Burgos regime on 18 November 1936.  Spain protested to the League of Nations against foreign intervention and requested a meeting of the Council. It convened on 12 December but took no action--except to attempt to strengthen the U.K.-France-dominated nonintervention regime.  (Foreign intervention was a prominent feature throughout the civil war. After the flurry of prorebel activity in the early months, Germany and Italy provided large-scale additional military assistance in early 1937. On the Loyalist side, about 40,000 volunteers from more than a dozen countries in Europe, along with the United States and Canada, fought in the International Brigades, though no more than 18,000 at any one time; and another 20,000 foreigners served in medical and auxiliary units. France gave passive aid to the Republic by opening its frontier in the spring of 1938. And massive German military aid to the rebels in the autumn of 1938 was crucial for their final triumph [see Case #67--Spanish Civil War IV--Last Phase].)
A lengthy five-stage international crisis over Alexandretta began on 9 September 1936 and lasted until 23 June 1939, with Turkey and France as crisis actors. The Sanjak of Alexandretta (Hatay) is a district in northwestern Syria that became a part of France's Syria Mandate in 1921, with strong opposition from Turkey. The territory, which included a valuable harbor, has a large Turkish population and had been the subject of negotiation in 1926. Turkey considered the Sanjak and port of Alexandretta important to its security and objected to Arab (Syrian) rule over Turks. France maintained that separating Hatay from Syria would mean the latter's dismemberment. In addition, as guardian of the area, France could not risk the loss of reputation and prestige among other states. On the other hand, events in Europe preoccupied France, and it later looked to Turkey as a potential ally against Germany and Italy or, at least, as a neutral state. On 9 September 1936 a crisis for Turkey was triggered by the publication of the contents of a Treaty of Alliance between France and Syria, which identified the Sanjak of Alexandretta as part of Syrian territory. President Kemal Atatürk responded by promising his people on 2 November that Hatay would be returned to Turkey. The dispute was brought before the League of Nations by Turkey's foreign minister, who also expressed a willingness to enter into direct negotiations with France. On 7 January 1937 the Turks moved troops to the border, triggering a crisis for France. France responded on the 22nd by entering into talks with Turkey and welcoming League intervention. On the 27th both agreed to an autonomous government for the region, which remained nominally part of Syria. This ended the first stage of the crisis over Alexandretta. The French Mandate was to end in three years, with Syria and Lebanon becoming independent states, and safeguards were planned for the minorities.  The manner in which the agreement was reached encouraged Turkey to reopen the issue. On 3 June 1937 Turkish troops were again sent to the border when the French imposed a curfew in Alexandretta because of local disturbances. France responded on the 7th with an offer to hold direct negotiations in Paris. The matter was brought to the League of Nations by France and Turkey, and two core documents were envisaged. The League was to draw up a Statute providing for protection of minorities and Turkey's economic rights. A Fundamental Law was to define for the Sanjak autonomous governing institutions. They were both ratified in May 1937. A Treaty of Amity was signed by the adversaries on 4 July 1937, ending the second stage of the crisis.  Turkey, still dissatisfied, threatened France with war on 29 October 1937 if new demands for changes in the electoral regulations for the Sanjak were not met. On 16 December France once more opened negotiations with Turkey and agreed to the demands on 29 January 1938, ending the third stage of the crisis over Alexandretta.  On 4 June 1938 Turkey raised its demands to include Turkish participation in the military control of the Sanjak and moved its 7th Division from its base at Adana toward the frontier. That day France responded by holding talks with the Turkish ambassador in Paris. Further negotiations were carried out on 13 June, and the French cabinet instructed General Huntziger to yield. On 4 July 1938 another treaty of friendship was signed between France and Turkey.  On 5 April 1939 a rumor of Turkish annexation was strengthened by Turkish military maneuvers in the Sanjak and a further concentration of troops near the border. France reacted the same day by dispatching a warship to the area and strengthening its troop positions. Turkey demanded the cession of Hatay. Finally, on 23 June 1939 the crisis as a whole ended with a Declaration of Mutual Assistance and France's acquiescence in the transfer of Hatay to Turkey.  The League of Nations, as noted, played a key role in the early stages of this lengthy crisis. It drafted the Statute of the Sanjak, governing its relations with a future government of Syria, and the Fundamental Law of the Sanjak. It sent a commission and observers but withdrew them on 26 June 1938. The League commission also drafted the Electoral Law and fixed a date for elections. Elections were not held under League supervision but under Turkish and French military control. The U.K. pressured France to end the conflict and to yield to Turkey. Protests were made about French concessions to Turkey by Italy, Yugoslavia, and Iraq.
Italy, Germany, and Spain were engaged in an acute intra-war crisis from 24 to 31 May 1937. Barely a month after the Republican victory in the Battle of Guadalajara (8-18 March 1937), Europe's great powers signed an agreement (20 April), designed to curtail the dispatch of arms to the protagonists in the Spanish civil war. However, it was ignored by the three most highly involved powers, Italy and Germany supporting the rebels, the USSR aiding the Republic.  On 26 April the city of Guernica in the Basque region of northern Spain was bombed into near oblivion by German planes, a precedent for the mass bombing of Coventry, Rotterdam, Dresden, and other cities during World War II.  Within the Republican-controlled part of Spain, civil strife among the myriad of leftist factions reached a peak: pro-Moscow Communist forces crushed a rebellion by anarchists and Trotskyites in Barcelona. Their pressure, too, led to the ouster of Socialist leader Largo Caballero from the premiership, a post he had held, with Communist backing, since early September 1936. He was replaced on 16 May by Juan Negrín, a physiology professor at the University of Madrid. On 24 May a crisis for Italy was triggered by a Republican air attack on the island of Palma de Mallorca which, inter alia, hit the Italian cruiser, Barletta, killing six Italian seamen. The Barletta was part of the Non-Intervention Committee's Naval Control, designed to monitor the dispatch of weapons to both sides in the civil war. But the port of Palma de Mallorca was a known center for arms shipments to the nationalist rebels--and had been assigned to France for this regulatory task, suggesting that the Italian ship's presence in Palma could not have been by chance.  The Non-Intervention Committee condemned the attack on the 25th. So too did the League Council the next day. However, Italy did not respond to a perceived threat to its self-image as a major power and, therefore, to its influence. That task was undertaken by its ally in the Spanish civil war, Germany, in a similar incident soon after.  On 26 May the battleship, Deutschland, then lying in port at Ibiza, was hit by two Republican planes, killing 31 German seamen and wounding 83. An enraged Hitler responded by ordering a retaliation raid. This was carried out on the 31st, when a German cruiser and four destroyers demolished 35 buildings and killed 19 persons by indiscriminate shelling of the Republican-controlled port of Almería. Germany and Italy also withdrew, temporarily, from the Non-Intervention Committee's naval patrol, returning to the fold on 16 July.  The naval bombing of Almería triggered a brief, but acute, crisis for Spain. At a meeting of the Republican cabinet in Valencia one of the most influential figures in the Negrín government, the Basque leader, Prieto, seriously proposed bombing the German fleet in the Mediterranean, fully aware of the possible escalation to major power war. After an intense discussion, President Azaña and most of the cabinet--and Moscow--opposed the idea; and the Almería "incident" was ignored. Spain's decision not to respond to the German attack thus ended the crisis for all three actors. The Almería crisis sheds much light on foreign intervention in the Spanish civil war.
A crisis between Japan and the USSR took place from 22 June to 4 July 1937. The issue of sovereignty over several small islands in the Amur River between the Soviet Union and Japanese-controlled Manchuria (Manchukuo) had long been in dispute: the crisis in 1937 was the 185th incident of its kind along this border. Between August 1936 and June 1937 a series of political trials and severe purges took place in the Soviet Union. Some persons who stood trial were executed because of alleged espionage on behalf of the Japanese. Many of the top-ranking Soviet officers stationed in the Far Eastern territories were removed. Inter alia, the Japanese wished to test Soviet strength and determination, as well as its readiness for war. On 19 June 1937 a small number of Soviet troops entered the two islets of Sennufu and Bolshoi on the Amur and abducted some gold miners. The same day Soviet gunboats, which routinely patrolled the area, engaged Manchukuon forces. On 22 June Japan's General Staff received reports of Soviet military occupation of the disputed islands: these reports triggered a crisis for Japan. It responded on the 24th with an order to concentrate troops in the area and a protest to the Soviet consul-general at Harbin. The trigger to the crisis for the Soviet Union, on 28 June, was a demand, delivered by the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, that all Soviet forces be evacuated from the islands. On 29 June forces of Japan's Kwantung Army bombed and sank a Soviet gunboat, apparently at the initiative of the local field commander. That day Soviet negotiators indicated a willingness to remove their troops, and, on 2 July, the USSR announced that it would comply with Japanese demands. The crisis ended for both actors on 4 July, with the Soviet evacuation of the islands. Four days later the Sino/Japanese War broke out. This crisis was not brought before the League of Nations.
The crisis for China and Japan arising from the Marco Polo Bridge incident began on 8 July 1937 and terminated on 16 January 1938. A civil-military conflict in Japan throughout the 1930s was reflected in its foreign policy behavior. The lines between official government policy and policy emanating from field commanders or other military decision makers were often blurred. Five different Japanese decision-making groups operated simultaneously on matters related to China: the emperor; the civil government; the general staff in Tokyo; the Kwantung Army headquarters in Manchuria; and the local field commanders. Since the Mukden Incident of 1931 (see Case #39), Japanese forces had strengthened their grip over Manchuria/Manchukuo and over areas in North China. Japanese garrisons, with China's agreement, had been positioned near Beijing and were carrying out maneuvers. The Marco Polo Bridge, near Lukouchiao, served two important railways. On the evening of 7 July 1937 the Japanese were attacked by Chinese troops. The Japanese commander immediately demanded entry into the neighboring town of Wanping to search for one of his soldiers allegedly captured by the Chinese forces. He was refused entry. The trigger for China occurred on 8 July 1937, when a reinforced Japanese army unit attacked Chinese forces. China's response, the next day, was to send additional troops to the area to assist the 29th and 37th Chinese divisions stationed there. When the Japanese authorities received reports of heavy reinforcements moving into the area on 9 July, a crisis was triggered for Japan. Heavy bombardment of Chinese forces ensued. Japan's major response, on the 11th, was to dispatch units of the Kwantung Army, as well as forces stationed in Korea, to the Honan-Hopei border region, into which hostilities had already spread.  Soon after the initial clashes at Lukouchiao in July 1937, China and Japan were fighting a full-scale war. Points of escalation in the crisis coincide with the military campaigns in the Sino/Japanese War. On 13 December 1937 Nanking fell, ending China's crisis but not the prolonged Sino/Japanese conflict; and it was only the first stage of their long war. The crisis ended for Japan on 16 January 1938, when Japan's prime minister stated that Japan would no longer recognize the Chinese government and would now attempt to set up Japanese regimes in different areas of China.  China appealed to the League of Nations on 12 September 1937. There were two Assembly resolutions, on 28 September and 6 October 1937, which condemned Japanese bombing of several cities in China. Unsuccessful attempts to find a solution were made by the following: mediation by the the U.K., at the Brussels Conference of November 1937; France, with a 14 July 1937 statement in favor of peaceful resolution; Italy, with a similar statement on 21 July; and Germany, through the Trautmann Mission, which began mediation on 28 October 1937. The U.S. was politically involved through the Roosevelt Quarantine Speech on 5 October. The USSR, which had signed a Treaty of Non-Aggression with China, supplied it with military equipment.  (The Sino/Japanese war, enlarged by the participation of the U.S., the U.K., and many other states after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 [see Case #88, in Multiregional PCs: World War II], raged on until the Japanese surrender in 1945.)
A postage stamp issued by Nicaragua, showing a map of its territory including a large part of southeastern Honduras, created a crisis for both states from mid-August to 10 December 1937. During the second week of August 1937 Nicaragua issued a postage stamp bearing a map of the Republic that included a considerable part of southeastern Honduras, marked as being "territory in dispute." This triggered a crisis for Honduras, which protested this "affront to her sovereignty" on the 25th. On 30 August Honduras responded with a concentration of forces along the Nicaraguan border. The likelihood of military hostilities triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. Its response, on 3 September, was a refusal to withdraw the stamp, declaring it to be the official map of Nicaragua.  Armed hostilities were prevented by the mediation of Costa Rica, Venezuela, and the United States. The three countries participated in a November conference in San Jose and were instrumental in resolving the crisis. On 10 December 1937 the two crisis actors signed a Pact of Reciprocal Agreement at San José in Costa Rica, terminating the crisis. (The conflict flared up again in 1957 [see Case #156].) This crisis was not brought to the League of Nations or the Pan American Union.
A crisis for Haiti began on 5 October 1937 and terminated on 31 January 1938. The Haitian economy had been seriously affected by the Great Depression in the United States, and large numbers of Haitian cane cutters migrated to the neighboring Dominican Republic and to Cuba. During 1936 and 1937 a plot by Trujillo, the ruler of the Dominican Republic, to undermine the government of Haiti was uncovered. Both countries had signed the General Convention of Inter-American Conciliation in 1929. When most of the sugar mills in Trujillo's Dominican Republic and Batista's Cuba closed down, the Haitians sought work in other fields. On 2 October 1937 Trujillo declared that Haitian trespassers would no longer be tolerated, while indicating that the slaughter of Haitians that began the day before at Banica, with 300 victims, would continue. That evening Trujillo ordered a new massacre of Haitian nationals in the vicinity of the Dominican Republic/Haiti border, which continued until 4 October. Haiti's President Vincent received word of the massacres on 5 October 1937. On the l0th a Note was delivered to the Dominican Republic expressing his doubts that the government of the Dominican Republic could have associated itself with these events and requesting investigation and compensation. An official joint declaration by the two countries in Washington on 23 October stated that relations between them had not been impaired. Nevertheless, as domestic unrest grew and both began concentrating troops at the border, Haitian decision makers perceived a threat of a Dominican Republic invasion.  On 12 November Haiti's major response was to request U.S., Mexican, and Cuban mediation. The Dominican Republic at first refused to cooperate with the commission set up by the three mediating countries, claiming that the magnitude of the dispute did not warrant mediation. On 18 December, four days after Vincent invoked the 1928 Pact and the use of a mediating commission, Trujillo consented to mediation. Negotiations were carried on directly, as well as through meetings in Washington, diplomatic channels, and the good offices of the Pope. Trujillo agreed to the draft settlement with minor revisions; and it was accepted and signed by both countries on 31 January 1938, ending their crisis.  The Haiti government's request to invoke the Inter-American Convention for Conciliation was within the framework of the Pan American Union. The mediation undertaken by the regional organization's commission consisting of representatives from Argentina, Guatemala, and Peru was very effective in abating the crisis and contributed to more rapid termination. The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
The sinking of the USS Panay near Nanjing (Nanking) caused a crisis for the United States from 12 to 26 December 1937. The Sino/Japanese conflict resulted in a mounting threat to the treaty rights and interests of Britain, France, and the United States in China. On 27 November 1937, as the fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies drew close to the city of Nanking, U.S. Ambassador Johnson moved most of his staff to Hankow. The few U.S. officials remaining in the capital were to be evacuated by the U.S. gunboat Panay, which had been ordered to stand by. On 9 December embassy personnel boarded the USS Panay, and, three days later, it docked about 28 miles above Nanking, along with three Standard Oil Company tankers. A crisis for the United States was triggered on 12 December 1937 when Japanese planes bombed and sank the Panay, along with the three Standard Oil Company ships. Japan's Foreign Minister, Hirota, expressed his apologies to the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo. In Washington, Japan's Ambassador, Saito, did likewise to Secretary of State Hull. President Roosevelt responded the following day with a message to Tokyo via Secretary Hull, expressing shock at the indiscriminate bombings and requesting that the emperor be informed of the president's response. Hull urged that Tokyo extend a full expression of regret and compensation. Further, the U.S. demanded guarantees from Japan that such incidents would not occur again.  As reports from China indicated that the Japanese attacks had been deliberate, indignation grew in Washington. On 17 December the U.S. cabinet met, and strong action was proposed by several members, especially Secretary of the Navy Claude Swanson. Roosevelt expressed concern at Chinese reaction if the assault went unrebuked, and asserted that a stronger response was necessary in order to foil a Japanese plan to force all Westerners out of Japan. An economic blockade was suggested, but no decision was made.  On 23 December a U.S. Board of Inquiry reported that the shelling of the Panay seemed to have been deliberate and premeditated. The following day, Hirota handed U.S. Ambassador Grew a Note admitting responsibility, offering amends, and giving assurances against reoccurrence of such an incident. The crisis ended for the United States with its formal acceptance of the Japanese Note on 26 December. The Roosevelt administration expressed satisfaction with Japan's apology and the latter's acceptance of all U.S. demands.  Toward the end of the crisis a U.S. naval officer was sent to London for technical discussions that would apply in the event that both countries declared war on Japan.  This crisis did not come before the League of Nations.
The Anschluss crisis between Austria and Germany took place between 12 February and 14 March 1938. Relations between Germany and Austria, after the 1934 Putsch attempt (see Case #45), had been governed by the Agreement of July 1936. The interpretation of that agreement, however, was marked by wide differences of opinion on the part of the two states. The government of Austria hoped to work these out in a meeting with Hitler. Accordingly, on the evening of 11 February 1938 Chancellor Schuschnigg left for Germany accompanied by his secretary of foreign affairs. A crisis for Austria began on 12 February 1938 when Hitler presented Schuschnigg with an ultimatum: the Austrian government was to recognize the Nazi Party and National Socialism as perfectly compatible with loyalty to Austria; the Minister of the Interior would be the Nazi Seyss-Inquart; an amnesty for all imprisoned Austrian Nazis was to be proclaimed within three days; and dismissed Nazi officials and officers would be reinstated. Finally, the Austrian economy was to be integrated with that of Germany, and Fischboek was to be appointed Minister of Finance. The Austrian chancellor signed the papers agreeing to Hitler's demands the same day.  By the end of the first week of the crisis Schuschnigg had decided upon some action to ensure the Austrian government's mastery of its own house. He called for a plebiscite on 13 March in which the Austrian people would be invited to declare whether or not they were in favor of an independent Austria.  The crisis trigger for Germany occurred on 9 March when Hitler was informed of Austria's plans to hold a plebiscite. A surprised Führer, furious at this obstruction of his plans, responded the next day with a decision to invade Austria. A special messenger was sent to Mussolini asking him not to interfere. By the 11th German army trucks and tanks were already on their way south. Schuschnigg offered to delay the plebiscite, but Göring demanded his resignation and the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor. President Miklas at first refused to do so, but at midnight on 11 March he complied as preparations for a German invasion of Austria proceeded seriously. On 13 March Seyss-Inquart secured the passage of a law by the Austrian government annexing Austria to the Third Reich. On the 14th the crisis ended for both actors when Hitler made his triumphal visit to Vienna. This was accompanied by strong anti-Semitic demonstrations.  While Austria had no illusions about Britain's and France's willingness to act in its favor, it perceived that opposition by Italy might serve as a deterrent to Hitler. When Italy refused to take any action against Germany, Austrian decision makers concluded that they had no choice but to comply with Hitler's demands.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
A Polish ultimatum created a crisis for Lithuania from 13 to 19 March 1938. After Vilna was annexed to Poland in 1922, an intense campaign was carried out by Lithuania to retrieve its capital in medieval times, including a refusal to conduct diplomatic or commercial relations with Poland. In 1936 the Polish foreign minister failed in his attempt to restore relations with Lithuania through the League of Nations. Lithuania refused to have its Vilna claim set aside and was willing to open only river traffic and communications, as well as consular facilities. Minority and frontier incidents contributed to the animosity between the two states. In February 1937 the visit of the Soviet chief of staff to Lithuania was followed by rumors of Soviet support for Lithuania's position, but these were denied. The incidents on the border were dealt with by local authorities within the framework of the 1928 Lithuanian-Polish agreement on frontier traffic. On the night of 10-11 March 1938 a Polish soldier was killed by Lithuanian frontier guards. Lithuania proposed solving the incident by a mixed commission of local authorities. A crisis for Lithuania was triggered on 13 March when the Polish government rejected its proposal and issued an official communiqué referring to a pending decision on steps for dealing with the situation existing between Poland and Lithuania. Rumors of Polish military action began to spread through Europe, which indeed had been Poland's initial intention. When Polish Foreign Minister Beck returned to the cabinet the following day, the military option was postponed. On 17 March Poland handed an ultimatum to the Lithuanian minister to Estonia. It demanded the restoration of normal relations by 31 March and gave the Lithuanian government 48 hours to reply. Vilna was not mentioned. The Lithuanian cabinet met all night, and parliament was summoned. German advice was sought. Having an interest in Memel, Germany counseled Lithuania to accept the Polish demands. German forces moved to the border. The U.K. and France also advocated Lithuanian compliance. The Lithuanian response on 19 March, to accept the ultimatum, also marked the termination of its crisis.  The League of Nations was minimally involved in this crisis, advising Poland to be reasonable and Lithuania to accept Polish terms. The Soviet Union, while refusing to supply military aid, supported Lithuania by informing Poland that Moscow reserved the right to take action in the event of a Polish attack on Lithuania.  (In subsequent months diplomatic relations and road and rail communications were reestablished. This was followed by a period of relative harmony between the two states. Vilna remained under Polish control until early in World War II.  In September 1939 the city was occupied by Soviet troops, as part of the USSR's share in the fourth [German-Soviet] partition of Poland. Then, on 10 October, under the terms of a mutual assistance pact, the USSR ceded Vilna and its hinterland to Lithuania in return for military bases. [See Case #75--Soviet Occupation--Baltic, in Europe: Non-PCs.]  On 21 July 1940 Lithuania, including Vilna, along with Latvia and Estonia, was formally incorporated into the USSR. The Baltic states regained their independence in 1991.)
The threat of German military hostilities against Czechoslovakia created a crisis for Czechoslovakia, France, the U.K., and Germany from 19 to 23 May 1938. The widespread perception of Hitler's objectives vis-à-vis Czechoslovakia, namely, to annex the German-speaking Sudetenland to the Reich, was reinforced by his speeches. The Sudeten Nazi Party, led by Konrad Henlein, received open support from Germany. Elections in the Sudetenland had been scheduled for 22 May 1938, and there was a heightening of turbulence in the area. A crisis for Czechoslovakia, France, and the U.K. was triggered on 19 May 1938 when intelligence sources reported that Germany was concentrating troops in Saxony, near the Czechoslovak border. These troops were, in fact, carrying out a combined army and air military game near and on the Koenigsbruck military training ground.  Czechoslovakia responded on the 20th by declaring a state of emergency and partial mobilization. Britain's and France's response, on 21 May, took the form of strong warnings to Germany, with a threat of intervention should Germany attack Czechoslovakia. Hitler, who apparently had no intention of invading Czechoslovakia in the immediate future, was surprised by the Czechoslovak response, as well as by that of the other actors, and perceived it as a threat to Germany. The German response was a decision by its War Council to retreat, as the Wehrmacht was not yet ready to meet the British-French-Czechoslovak challenge. On 23 May the Czechoslovak ambassador to Berlin was assured that Nazi Germany had no aggressive intentions toward his country, and the crisis ended for all the participants. The underlying conflict, however, continued unabated and reached a further stage of crisis four months later--the Munich crisis (see Case #64).  There was no USSR intervention in the May weekend crisis. Nor was its aid solicited by the U.K. and France, despite the fact that the Soviet Union had an alliance with France and Czechoslovakia concerning the latter's independence and territorial integrity. This crisis did not come before the League of Nations.
A crisis between Japan and the USSR over an incident at Lake Hasan occurred between 13 July and 11 August 1938. Both Soviet and Japanese border garrisons had been posted in the area of Lake Hasan (Changkufeng) on the Soviet-Manchukuo frontier since the initial Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931. Between 1935 and 1938 there were more than 50 border incidents among Soviet, Japanese, and Manchukuon forces, almost all minor skirmishes. Due to the complex terrain there were many areas where the frontier was not clear, including the Changkufeng hill area. In October 1937 there had been a minor clash in the vicinity, but Changkufeng itself was not involved. On 7 July 1938 local Japanese commanders received information of Soviet intentions to occupy the area, and on 11 July about 40 Soviet soldiers appeared atop Changkufeng and began construction of new fortified positions. On 13 July imperial headquarters in Tokyo perceived a crisis for Japan when they received information attesting to Soviet occupation of, and activity at, Changkufeng. The Korean army headquarters were also informed on that day. Both armies were preparing for a major campaign at Hangchow in the Sino/Japanese War, and their respective headquarters did not wish an escalation of the situation near Lake Hasan. The Japanese local commanders, seemingly acting independently, met the Soviet activity with military force. The major fighting began on 27 July, but there was no evidence to suggest official sanction by either a supreme military or civil decision-making body in Japan.  On 29 July the Soviets crossed the frontier at Shatsofeng, near Changkufeng, and began to construct positions there. On 31 July the Soviet Union perceived a crisis when its forces were involved in heavy fighting. The Soviets responded with a major counterattack on 2 August, the same day that Japan's major response occurred: the Japanese cabinet decided to settle the dispute through negotiation. Indeed, Japan's civilian authorities had been endeavoring to remove any possibility of further military clashes by ordering the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the area. Between 4 and 11 August Ambassador Shigemitsu and Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov met to discuss the possibilities of a peaceful settlement. By 7 August heavy artillery pieces were being employed by the Soviet forces as fighting continued. On 10 August Litvinov proposed a truce, which came into effect the following day, terminating the crisis for both actors.  This crisis was not submitted to the League of Nations.
The Munich crisis--for Czechoslovakia, France, the U.K., and the USSR--took place from 7 September to early October 1938. The annexation of Austria by Germany in March 1938 (see Case #60--Anschluss, in Europe: Non-PCs) created an immediate threat to Czechoslovakia, which feared that its German-speaking areas would be Hitler's next target. Czechoslovakia sought assurances from France and the U.K., which refused to give firm guarantees. In April Anglo-French leaders met in London to seek a solution to the problem. In order to avoid the possibility of war with Hitler the two powers began to press Czechoslovakia to make concessions over Sudetenland. In the third week of May rumors reached Prague that large German military forces were gathering near the frontier in Silesia and northern Austria, possibly in preparation for an operation against Czechoslovakia (see Case #62). The activity of the Sudeten German Party (SdP), which was strongly supported by Germany, was intensified. Its leader, Konrad Henlein, presented the party's demands in the Karlsbad Programme on 7 June. In June, July, and August there was an intensification of SdP activity. On 18 July the British government decided to send a mediator to Prague and, on 3 August, Lord Runciman arrived. A "Third Plan" was presented by the Czechoslovak government on 24 August, which proposed a compromise between its original proposals over the Sudetenland and the SdP's demands. As tension in the country built up, Runciman came up with a "Fourth Plan" between 3 and 7 September, leaning strongly toward the earlier Sudeten German demands. The Nazi Party Congress convened at Nuremberg on 5 September. On 7 September 1938 tension in Czechoslovakia escalated when 82 members of the Sudeten German Party were detained in Moravska Ostrava for arms smuggling and other offenses against the state. The SdP, for its part, charged the Czechoslovak police with violence, and Hitler ordered Henlein to break off all negotiations with Prague. That day, too, the Times of London published a leading article supporting the "Fourth Plan" as the solution to the Sudeten problem. The arrests on 7 September, which had effectively laid to rest any hope of reaching a compromise solution through the Runciman Mission, triggered a crisis for Czechoslovakia. This was followed by almost daily demonstrations accompanied by acts of violence by the SdP. On the 9th President Benes addressed his people and attempted to win goodwill for the "Fourth Plan."  On 12 September a crisis was triggered for France and the U.K. when Hitler addressed the Nazi Party Congress and demanded self-determination for the Sudeten Germans. That evening riots began in the Sudeten districts. The French and British responses came the following day: Prime Minister Chamberlain cabled Hitler that he was willing to travel to Germany to seek a solution to the crisis. That day, too, Premier Daladier requested Chamberlain to arrange a Three-Power Conference to allow the transfer of Sudetenland to Germany. Several French economic and financial decrees were prepared, as well, in case of war.  On 15 September Chamberlain met with Hitler at Berchtesgaden. He returned the next day, bringing his colleagues and the French government Hitler's plan for the cession of the Sudeten districts to Germany. Anglo-French discussions began in London on 18 September to work out a proposal that Chamberlain could bring to Hitler at their forthcoming meeting in Godesberg. The Anglo-French Plan, announced on the 19th, called for the immediate transfer to Germany of Sudeten areas with over 50 percent German inhabitants and the acceptance by Czechoslovakia of a neutralized status, which would require the abrogation of its treaties with France and the USSR.  That day a crisis was triggered for the Soviet Union when President Benes requested USSR affirmation of the Soviet-Czechoslovak Pact. The Soviets responded the same day by affirming the Pact on condition of prior French action. On 20 September Czechoslovakia rejected the Anglo-French Plan. But on the 21st Prague reversed its decision and accepted the Plan, after having been served an ultimatum by both Britain and France.  The Godesberg meeting between Hitler and Chamberlain took place on 22 and 23 September. The German leader increased his demands and issued an ultimatum for the territorial transfer by 1 October, the date originally set by Hitler in April. Benes ordered general mobilization in Czechoslovakia. On the 23rd the USSR warned Poland that it would denounce the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression if the Polish government persisted in sending troops to the Czechoslovakia-Polish frontier. A partial mobilization in France was ordered on 24 September. On the 25th the British fleet and its auxiliary air force units were mobilized. Hitler spoke at the Sportspalast on the 26th, stating that the Czechoslovaks would have to come to terms peaceably with their non-German minorities. Chamberlain sent a message to Hitler that Britain would support France if it were drawn into war over Czechoslovakia. A final appeal to Britain to avoid war was sent by Hitler on the 27th. A conference among Italy, France, Germany, and Britain was called.  The signing of the Four-Power Agreement at Munich on 30 September 1938 terminated the crisis for France and the U.K. Czechoslovakia was forced to accept the terms. War with Germany had been temporarily avoided. The Soviet termination date was sometime early in October, once German troops were in occupation of all the German-claimed territories and war had been averted.  Other involved actors were Italy and the U.S. Mussolini formally proposed the terms--secretly drawn up by the German foreign office--that were incorporated in the Agreement. President Roosevelt sent personal appeals to all actors on 26 and 27 September to refrain from the use of force. There was no League of Nations involvement in this crisis.
Republican Spain experienced another intra-war crisis in its prolonged civil war, from 30 October to 18 November 1938. The war raged on, the Loyalists actively supported by the USSR and the International Brigades, the Nationalists by Italy and Germany. Moreover, many ships, notably those of interested European major powers, were attacked by "unknown" submarines, especially in the summer of 1937. An agreement reached on 14 September, with Germany and Italy absent, authorized ships of the Non-Intervention naval patrol to respond in kind if attacked. The indiscriminate raids continued, however. And the patrols failed to prevent massive foreign intervention throughout the Spanish civil war, mainly because the primary motive of the U.K. and France, the prime movers of "Non-Intervention," was to avoid hostilities with Germany and Italy. The latter was given a zone off the Mediterranean to patrol, which enabled it to continue sending military equipment to the rebels via Majorca.  There were many important military campaigns. The Battle of Brunette took place in July 1937, with a reverse outcome to that at Guadalajara, that is, a Nationalist victory, and very high Loyalist casualties (25,000 killed). The Republic's moderately successful Aragón offensive took place in August. And the rebels ultimately triumphed in the bitter, costly, three-month Battle of Teruel in February 1938. Barcelona was bombed by the rebels in mid-March. By mid-April 1938 rebel forces had reached the sea at Vinaroz, cutting off Catalonia from the rest of Republican Spain.  These were important developments, militarily; but none was--or catalyzed--an international crisis.  The Battle of the Ebro was to become a decisive engagement of the Spanish civil war. It began with a surprise attack by Republican forces on 24 July, designed to reduce the pressure on Valencia. Its initial success generated a sense of defeatism among the rebels in Burgos, Franco's capital. The Loyalist advance was stopped on 2 August. Nevertheless, Republican optimism about the war's outcome increased in August-September, kindled by a hope that preoccupation with the Czechoslovak crisis would lead to Germany's withdrawal from the Spanish civil war. That hope was shattered on 19 September when Germany, in the midst of the Munich crisis (see Case #64, in Czechoslovakia/Germany PC), reaffirmed its support for the Nationalists. A Republican attempt on 2 October to set in motion a negotiated solution was rebuffed by the rebels. And Soviet support for the Republic now declined sharply, largely because, having failed to forge an alliance with France and the U.K. against Nazism, Moscow began a basic shift in policy that was to culminate in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939. The Battle of the Ebro was transformed into an international crisis for Republican Spain on 30 October 1938 when the rebels launched a major counteroffensive at Sierra de Caballs. By that time the International Brigades, then with about 13,000 volunteers, had disbanded. These included 7,000 who were at the front in the Battle of the Ebro. By contrast, Italian involvement in the war was at its peak, with 48,000 troops actively engaged and 10,000 more offered by Mussolini.  Nationalist forces reached the Ebro River on 3 November, a turning point in the war. By the 10th there were only six artillery batteries west of the river. The Battle of the Ebro ended on 18 November in total defeat for the Republic, with an estimated 30,000 killed, among 70,000 casualties, compared to 33,000 on the Nationalist side. This crisis for Republican Spain had ended, a prelude to the last phase--and crisis--of the civil war.
A crisis for France over this issue began on 30 November 1938 and ended on 31 March 1939. Differences between France and Italy were of long standing. France possessed an important trade route in East Africa through the railroad from Djibouti in Somaliland, where Italy's colonies of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland were located. Corsica, though Italian speaking, was under French control. Rivalries existed as well over satellites in the post-Hapsburg Empire states of eastern Europe. Italy's use of the Suez Canal in order to maintain contact with its East African colonies became a source of tension as its objections to the high French-imposed tolls increased. As for the balance of power in Europe, France looked to Italy as a potential ally against Hitler.  On 14 April 1935 representatives from France, Italy, and Great Britain met at Stresa and aligned themselves formally against Germany. Soon after the Wal-wal incident (see Case #47), France signed an agreement with Italy in which small areas were ceded and a settlement of the Italian minority problem in Tunisia was reached. During the Italian war with Ethiopia (see Case #47), France exerted considerable effort not to alienate Italy. When the League Council condemned Italy as the aggressor in Ethiopia in October 1935 French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval was able to prevent the adoption of any substantive sanctions, specifically oil sanctions and the closure of the Suez Canal to Italian shipping. In the period after Italy's annexation of Ethiopia, France made further efforts to improve relations with Italy: it recognized the annexation, signed a commercial agreement on 7 November 1938 and accredited a new French ambassador to the king of Italy--emperor of Ethiopia. A parliamentary upheaval during Foreign Minister Ciano's speech in Rome on 30 November 1938, which called for retribution over French control of Tunisia, Corsica, Nice, Savoy, and Djibouti, turned into a street demonstration that Mussolini addressed from his balcony in the Palazzo Venezia, and triggered a crisis for France. To French protests in Paris and Rome, the reply was that the Italian government could not be responsible for spontaneous demonstrations that did not reflect its views. An anti-French campaign was begun by the Italian press and, by 5 December, demonstrations and telegrams of support for France had come from Corsica and Tunisia. On 17 December the Italian government informed France that their bilateral agreement of January 1935 was now void and that France was obliged to produce new proposals. This was not divulged in Paris until five days later. France sent copies of the Italian Note to Germany and Britain and replied on 26 December that, as far as it was concerned, the 1935 agreement was still intact but that there was a need for new proposals on French and Italian interests in Africa.  France's major response, on 2 January 1939, was Prime Minister Daladier's departure for a visit to Corsica, Algeria, and Tunisia, where he stated before cheering crowds that France would stand firm in all its territories in the face of any Italian demands or threats. France also reinforced its forces in Africa and in the Mediterranean. On 14 January Chamberlain and Halifax arrived in Rome for Anglo-Italian negotiations. Despite the request of the French government for no intercession on the Franco-Italian dispute, some British intervention was attempted, but without success--France and Italy continued to exchange demands and France repeated its intention to defend its territory. The crisis continued until 31 March, a week before Italy's Invasion of Albania (see Case #71, in Italy/Albania/Yugoslavia PC), when Mussolini stated that he would not press demands on France.  The United States cabled its support to France, while Great Britain and Germany supported Italy. The League of Nations was not involved.  (The issue did not die down, and throughout the war against Albania the Italian demands remained a source of dispute.)
Republican Spain's last intrawar crisis during the Spanish civil war lasted from 23 December 1938 to 31 March 1939. As a result of their triumph in the Battle of the Ebro (see Case #65), General Franco's rebels were confident that they could now win the war. They planned their Catalonia campaign for 10 December 1938. It was postponed until the 15th and then to the 23rd. A decisive input was a massive flow of arms from Germany in November. The Nationalists' "Christmas Offensive," with the Italian forces in Spain playing a central role in their campaign, began on 23 December with a crossing of the Segre River. This triggered an intra-war crisis for Republican Spain. By 3 January 1939 the Loyalists' defense line was pierced. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano warned of direct intervention by "regular" Italian divisions if France intervened on behalf of the Republic. But, as always during the Spanish civil war, this was unlikely. Tarragona fell to the rebels on 17 January. And the great prize of Barcelona, symbol of the Republic, fell on the 26th.  Panic led to a mass migration of Catalans toward the French border: between 27 January and 10 February half a million Spaniards, including 250,000 members of the Republican army, crossed into France. The Nationalists' Catalan campaign ended on 9 February in total triumph.  By then the remnants of the Loyalists' regime had crumbled. On 1 February Premier Negrín had offered three conditions of surrender--a guarantee of Spain's independence, a guarantee of the right of Spain's people to choose their own government, and freedom from persecution. These were rejected by Franco. Most of the Republic's leaders fled to France.  France and the U.K. recognized the Nationalist regime in Burgos on 27 February, despite vocal opposition from the moderate Left in both parliaments. The next day President Azaña resigned from the Republican presidency. Negrín left for France on 6 March. Finally, on 31 March 1939, the Nationalist forces occupied Madrid, ending Republican Spain's last intra-war crisis and the Spanish civil war. On 1 April the United States recognized the Franco regime, leaving the USSR as the only major European power that refused to recognize the outcome of the war.  The League of Nations was embroiled in the Spanish civil war from the outset, but never decisively. It began a series of discussions on Spain in 1936. The attempt by the League Council to pass a resolution in 1938 failed to achieve unanimity. Its only role was to supervise the withdrawal of volunteers enrolled in the International Brigades. It did not contribute to crisis abatement or, more generally, to conflict resolution.
Germany's overt threat of annexation precipitated a crisis for Czechoslovakia on 14-15 March 1939. The period between Munich and the annexation, October 1938 to March 1939, witnessed national and societal unrest in Czechoslovakia. Slovak and Ruthenian nationalities, supported by Germany and Hungary, were making increasing demands for independence. There was a rapid deterioration in Czechoslovakia's economic situation, apparently generated by the secession of important industrial areas of the Sudetenland and Teschen after September, as a result of the Munich Agreement. This economic and societal disruption formed the basis of Hitler's claim that, as Czechoslovakia was composed of dissatisfied nationalities precipitating social unrest that culminated in economic deterioration, it was in fact no longer a viable state.  On 17 December 1938 Hitler, assuming no resistance, directed his armed forces to make preparations to occupy the rest of Czechoslovakia. This directive was followed by a final order on 12 March, at the height of the Slovak tension, for the invasion of Czechoslovakia and its incorporation into the Reich. The following day the Czechoslovak President, Emil Hacha, requested an interview with Hitler. On 14 March both Ruthenia and Slovakia proclaimed their independence from Czechoslovakia. On the morning of 14 March Hitler informed Hacha that German troops had already occupied the important industrial town of Moravska Ostrava and that they were now poised all along the perimeter of Bohemia and Moravia. The crisis for Czechoslovakia had been triggered. Hitler, while ignoring the issue of Slovak independence, stated that, if the Czechoslovak president invited the entry of German troops, Czechoslovakia would be allowed to remain autonomous after incorporation into the Reich. If the Czechoslovak army resisted, Czechoslovakia would be annihilated.  Faced with this ultimatum, Hacha phoned his government in Prague early in the morning of the 15th and advised capitulation. After receiving their consent, he signed the note of surrender that had been drawn up earlier by the German foreign office. The crisis ended at 6 a.m. on 15 March, when German troops poured into Bohemia and Moravia. There was no resistance. The same day they entered Prague. A proclamation of Bohemia-Moravia and Slovakia as German protectorates followed.  The USSR took no action during the critical days of the crisis. The U.K. declared that its post-Munich guarantee of Czechoslovakia's territorial integrity and independence against unprovoked aggression was no longer applicable because the declaration of Slovak independence had put an end to the state whose frontiers London had promised to guarantee. An official protest from France was its only activity in the crisis. There was no League of Nations involvement.  (More than half a century elapsed before the beginning of a formal state-to-state reconciliation. On 21 January 1997, Chancellor Kohl of Germany and Czech Prime Minister Klaus signed a declaration expressing mutual regrets: the former, for the occupation and annexation of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939 and for Nazi "policies of violence"; the latter, for the expulsion of 2.5 million Sudeten Germans from the restored Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of World War II. As expected, both the Sudeten Germans, concentrated in Bavaria since the mid-1940s, and right-wing Czechs objected strenuously to the concessions made by their respective governments.)
Germany's demand for the annexation of Memel created a crisis for Lithuania from 15 to 22 March 1939. Memel and its surrounding area, once part of East Prussia, were awarded to Lithuania by the Versailles Treaty, under the supervision of a League High Commissioner, and were formally incorporated in 1923. The city, German-speaking, was made semiautonomous on 7 May 1924 and was guaranteed by France, Britain, Italy, and Japan. The surrounding area, Lithuanian-speaking, was placed under Lithuania's sovereignty. Increasing tension between the area's populations followed, especially after the Nazi accession to power in Berlin in 1933.  In 1934 many prominent Germans were arrested in Memel and were accused of planning a Nazi putsch there (see Case #49--Kaunas Trials). The Germans retaliated by boycotting Lithuanian agricultural produce. By 1936 the situation had normalized, and a trade treaty was signed between the two countries. The Nazi Party, though illegal, grew in Memel, and more arrests took place in the late spring of 1937. Elections were due to be held in late 1938; and despite Lithuanian electoral law concessions, Nazi strength grew in Memel during the campaign, with the anticipation of a reintegration into Germany after the Austrian Anschluss of March 1938 (see Case #60). After the elections German representation had improved to slightly over 80 percent of the Memel Diet (legislature). The new Lithuanian government, formed in December 1938, endeavored to be firm on the issue of Memel's autonomy, while Nazification and demands for incorporation into the Reich continued and German pressure increased. In early March 1939 the German press took up a renewed anti-Lithuanian campaign. On the 13th the Lithuanian prime minister perceived the danger of a German coup in Memel and related this to the British chargé d'affaires: he anticipated an announcement at the forthcoming meeting of the Memel Diet. On 15 March, when Germany took over Bohemia and Moravia, the remnant of Czechoslovakia (see Case #68--Czech. Annexation, in Czech./Germany PC), a crisis over Memel was triggered for Lithuania. Nazi party leader Neumann addressed a special meeting of the Memel Diet, pressing for a radical change in the relations between Memel and Lithuania. Rumors of immediate Nazi annexation followed rapidly. At a meeting between the local Lithuanian governor and German party leaders the governor refused to consider any concessions. The following day his attitude became more conciliatory, and a promise was made to convene the Diet on 25 March.  On 20 March Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys was summoned to Berlin and was handed an ultimatum to return Memel to Germany. He was also warned not to consult any other power. Nonetheless, he spoke to the British, French, and Polish military attachés, indicating that Lithuania's decision would depend on their willingness to provide aid. Upon his return to Kaunas, German troops were reported moving toward the frontier with Lithuania. Shortly thereafter, Germany demanded an agreement. The Lithuanian cabinet met on 20 March and accepted the ultimatum. Two communiqués, issued by Lithuania, were withdrawn upon German disapproval.  The crisis ended on 22 March with the formal approval of an agreement signed in Berlin. Hitler arrived in Memel the following day to an enthusiastic welcome. The agreement safeguarded Lithuanian economic access and a free harbor zone and pledged nonaggression between the two countries. Britain, France, and Poland, the other involved actors, denied aid to Lithuania.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Poland over Danzig took place between 21 March and 6 April 1939. The Treaty of Versailles declared Danzig, predominantly German-speaking, a free city. Poland was allowed to use the port, its only access to the sea. A strip of land lying east of Danzig and the local Polish provinces linked Germany with East Prussia. In 1934 Poland signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany, and in November 1937 Hitler officially disavowed his aim of incorporating Danzig into Germany.  On 4 October 1938 the Polish ambassador in Berlin met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The latter proposed incorporating Danzig into the Reich, granting an extraterritorial railroad and road into Germany, while leaving Poland to maintain a road, railway, and free port in Danzig, and guaranteed markets, a recognition of boundaries, and an extension of the Polish-German Pact. Poland would also join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Polish Foreign Minister Beck declined and insisted on retaining Polish rights to Danzig while proposing a joint Polish-German guarantee to replace League of Nations protection. On 21 October Hitler began to plan for military action over Danzig. Beck met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in Germany in early January 1939. After the final German takeover in Czechoslovakia (see Case #68--Czech. Annexation, in Czech./Germany PC) and Hitler's demand to Lithuania for Memel, both in mid-March 1939 (see Case #69), the issue of Danzig flared up once again. Poland's crisis was triggered on 21 March 1939 when Ribbentrop placed Germany's demand for Danzig before Polish Ambassador Lipski. The Polish foreign minister sought support against German aggression, especially from Britain, which was at that time trying to establish joint guarantees with France and the Soviet Union. On 21-22 March Anglo-French conversations took place in London. The addition of an economic threat to Romania by Germany induced the U.K. to try to reach an agreement with France for the support of the whole of Eastern Europe, including Polish aid to Romania, if necessary. On 26 March Poland responded to German demands by offering to consider simplifying road and rail communications to East Prussia and by rejecting any extraterritorial highway, as well as the annexation of Danzig to the Reich.  Ribbentrop, mentioning Polish interests in the Ukraine and hinting that Hitler might conclude that there could be no understanding with Poland, asked for further Polish consideration, to which Lipski agreed. Meanwhile, the U.K. continued to maneuver for a Four-Power declaration, while dropping the Soviet Union from the list, at Poland's request. Britain finally agreed upon a declaration of support for Poland while, at the same time, soliciting Polish support for Romania and Yugoslavia. On 31 March Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the U.K. would offer support to Poland if there was any threat to its independence, and that France had agreed to do likewise. On 3 April Beck journeyed to London for further talks, receiving an official guarantee on 6 April that the U.K. "would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power." This terminated the crisis for Poland in victory; but the ultimate outcome of the conflict over Danzig remained uncertain--until it was overrun by German forces five months later.  (The Danzig crisis of March-April 1939, like those over the German annexations of Czechoslovakia [Case #68] and Memel [Case #69] and the Invasion of Albania [Case #71, in Italy/Albania/Yugoslovia PC], was an integral part of the intense conflict throughout 1939 that was to culminate in the outbreak of World War II [Case #74, in World War II PC]. Danzig remained an important issue throughout the summer of 1939 as the city became semisecretly militarized and war approached. On 1 September Germany invaded Poland.)  The Soviet Union negotiated with Britain and France on forging a bloc against Germany but backed away when other demands were not met by the Western powers. This encouraged Polish suspicions of Moscow's motives and potential actions in support of Germany. The League of Nations was not active in this crisis.
A crisis for Albania, France, Greece, and the U.K. occurred between 25 March and 13 April 1939. In 1928 a new constitution transformed Albania into a hereditary constitutional monarchy with Ahmed Zog crowned as King. Zog was given broad authority and ruled as a dictator until 1939. During the 1930s, on several occasions, King Zog attempted to break away from Italy but was forced to back down when Italian diplomatic, economic, and military pressure was applied. By 1938 the Italians had become impatient with Zog and looked for a way to assume direct control over Albania. A crisis for Albania was triggered on 25 March 1939 when Italy presented a treaty draft, in the form of an ultimatum: it proposed the stationing of Italian troops in the main centers and on the frontiers of Albania, along with the full participation of the Italian minister in Tirana in the Albanian Council of Ministers. The pact was rejected by King Zog and, at the beginning of April, he presented counterproposals with new concessions. Mussolini was not placated. As Italian/Albanian negotiations were taking place, rumors spread about the completion of Italian military preparations for invasion, with a concentration of army and naval forces in southern Italy. Despite violent anti-Italian demonstrations throughout Albania, Zog issued a public declaration on 3 April denying the worsening of relations with Italy. Following a cabinet meeting the next day the king indicated to the Greek minister, then doyen of the diplomatic corps, that Italian demands would mean control over all the essentials of Albanian life and the establishment of an Italian protectorate on Greece's borders. Representatives of France, the U.K., and the Balkan Entente were informed that Italian demands would be rejected by force. Also on the 4th Mussolini set a deadline of 6 April for the acceptance of Italy's demands. Albania's major response was a decision by the council of ministers, on the 6th, to reject the Italian ultimatum; a negative reply was sent the same day. Preparations for resistance were made, including the distribution of arms.  Italian forces invaded Albania on 7 April, triggering a crisis for France, Greece, and the U.K. France perceived the fall of Albania as a prelude to an Italian-German offensive from the North Sea to Egypt. The Greek government was convinced that, once Albania had been annexed, the Italians would invade Corfu. And the U.K., fearing that the situation might undermine its influence and the status quo in the Mediterranean, became concerned about a possible Italian invasion of Greece.  The crisis for Albania ended on 8 April when the king and other Albanian officials fled to Greece. The Italians entered the capital that day. On the 9th Greek Prime Minister Metaxas informed the British minister that the Italians intended to attack Corfu between 10 and 12 April. On the same day two Greek destroyers were manned and made ready for action.  At an urgent meeting on 9 April the French National Defense Committee decided to move the French Atlantic fleet to the Mediterranean, to send reinforcements to Tunis and French Somaliland, and to call up reservists. The British major response occurred on 11 April, after precautions had been taken in Malta, air services to Italy had been suspended, and military leaves canceled. That day, at a meeting of the cabinet's foreign policy committee, a statement was approved warning Italy that any aggression against Greek territory would be regarded as a threat to the vital interests of Great Britain.  The crisis for France, Greece, and the U.K. ended on 13 April 1939. The British prime minister declared a guarantee of the independence of Greece and Romania. A similar guarantee was made by France's Premier Daladier the same day. These assurances terminated the crisis for Greece as well. There was no League of Nations activity, despite Albania's protest on 8 April. On 13 April the new Albanian puppet regime followed Italy's lead and withdrew from the League.
A crisis for the Soviet Union and Japan arising from an incident at Nomonhan occurred between 28 May and 15 September 1939. Nomonhan is an oasis in the Gobi Desert whose pastures have been used for centuries by Mongol nomads. The territory, partly under Japanese and partly under Soviet control in the 1930s, was inhabited by Mongols. Japanese troops were engaged as allies of Manchukuo, by virtue of the 1932 Japan-Manchukuo Treaty of Mutual Assistance; and Soviet forces were allies of Outer Mongolia under their 1936 Pact of Mutual Assistance. The Manchukuo government claimed that the Khalha River was the boundary between Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia, whereas the government of Outer Mongolia declared that the boundary lay a number of miles east of the river. On 28 May 1939 a clash took place on the Mongolia/Manchukuo border in which 39 Outer Mongolian planes were shot down and 150 Mongols killed by Japanese forces. This triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union, which perceived a territorial threat. Moscow warned Japan on the 31st that the Soviet Union would defend Outer Mongolia's borders as if they were its own. A counterattack by Soviet forces in the vicinity of Nomonhan on 18 June, accompanied by air attacks on key strategic points in the rear, triggered a crisis for Japan. The Japanese attacked again on 28 June. During July the Japanese military attaché in Moscow reported that the Soviets were sending reinforcements to the Far East and that a new offensive was expected around the middle of August. It was thought that Japanese strength in the area would be sufficient to halt an enemy offensive.  Fighting continued throughout July; the major Soviet response came on 20 August when Soviet-Mongolian troops inflicted a heavy defeat on the Japanese, including 17,000 casualties, a third of their forces in that battle. They were subsequently driven out of the disputed area. The major Japanese response, on 28 August, was a decision to commence discussions with the Soviets in Moscow without delay. All this occurred while Japan's Kwantung Army was planning a major counteroffensive with four fresh divisions. On the 30th an imperial order was sent to the Kwantung Army to desist from further operations in the Nomonhan area. After several days of negotiations, Foreign Ministers Togo and Molotov reached an agreement on 15 September 1939, providing for a cease-fire along the lines held that day and the setting up of a commission to settle the boundary problem.  This crisis did not come before the League of Nations.
An international crisis for the U.K. over Tientsin began on 14 June 1939 and terminated effectively on 29 August of that year. After Japan's proclamation of "The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," on 3 November 1938, Tokyo concentrated on tightening its hold over the occupied areas of China and on undermining China's currency. Japan put pressure on the International Settlements in Shanghai and Amoy, and the British Concession at Tientsin, maintaining that these foreign enclaves were blocking the absorption of occupied China into "A New Order of East Asia." The Japanese had four main grievances against Britain at Tientsin: the Chinese guerrillas allegedly used the British Concession as a base to launch anti-Japanese attacks and propaganda; circulation of the Chinese currency was allowed; the British banks refused to accept the Japanese-sponsored Peking (Beijing) regime's Federal Reserve Bank notes; and, finally, that silver reserves deposited by Chinese government banks in Tientsin were not reported to the Japanese authorities.  On 9 April 1939 an official of the Peking puppet regime was assassinated within the British Concession in Tientsin. Two of the arrested suspects confessed under Japanese interrogation but retracted when they were handed over to the British. When the British authorities in Tientsin refused to place the suspects under the jurisdiction of the pro-Japanese Peking regime for a trial, Japan sent the U.K. an ultimatum. Britain proposed an advisory committee to deal with the problem, but Japan refused. On 14 June 1939 a crisis was triggered for the U.K. when Japan imposed a blockade on the British and French Concessions in Tientsin, cutting off supplies and harassing persons entering and leaving the Concessions. Japan then demanded Britain's abandonment of the Chinese national government and its cooperation with the "New Order." London received information that the Japanese General Staff had plans for war with Britain that were supported by a faction of the Japanese army.  The Tientsin issue was discussed by the British cabinet on 14 June, when Foreign Secretary Halifax suggested serious consideration of economic sanctions, but this was postponed. While Halifax advocated retaliatory measures, a report from the Colonial Board of Trade and foreign office was issued advising against them. On the 18th a report from Britain's chief of staff concluded that it would not be justifiable to take any action that might lead to hostilities with Japan. On 19 June the foreign secretary authorized Ambassador Craigie to propose conducting negotiations over Tientsin in Tokyo. This was accepted by Japan on the 23rd. On 15 July Japan's prime minister proposed a formula in which British assistance to China would be withheld during the large-scale Japanese military operations. On the 24th the Craigie-Arita Agreement was reached between the two governments providing for British recognition of the "actual situation in China" and stating that British officials and subjects would be instructed to refrain from obstructing the Japanese army.  The Tokyo conference on the Tientsin issue opened on 27 July, with quick agreement on the proposals dealing with the restoration and maintenance of order in Tientsin. Negotiations reached an impasse on economic issues. The conference was adjourned on 20 August. The following day the British foreign office circulated a paper in which Britain declared that, in the event of hostilities with Japan, it would denounce the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, nationals would be evacuated from North China, and economic steps would be instituted against Japan. On that day, as well, Japan was stunned by the announcement of the German/Soviet Non-Aggression Pact (see Case #74--Entry into World War II, in World War II PC). Japan was at that time engaged in large-scale fighting against Soviet troops at Nomonhan (see Case #72). The Pact enabled the USSR to concentrate on the East Asian situation without fear for its European flank. After the fall of the Hiranuma government, the silver and currency questions lapsed and the danger of an Anglo/Japanese war became less probable. On 26 August a formula was suggested by the Japanese embassy in London, to which Halifax agreed on the 29th. The outbreak of war in Europe in September, however, prevented a formal agreement. A British attempt to get U.S. backing resulted in a Roosevelt statement on 26 July giving notice to Japan of the U.S.'s intention to terminate the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
The crisis immediately preceding--and following the onset of--World War II began on 20 August 1939 and ended on 28 September of that year. The following 21 countries were crisis actors: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K., and the USSR. The Czech. Annexation crisis of March 1939 (see Case #68, in Czech./Germany PC) confronted the small states of Europe, especially Poland and Romania, with forebodings of a similar fate. In an effort to build an effective European coalition of anti-German forces, negotiations were initiated between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. The failure of these negotiations, to a large extent, was due to Poland's and Romania's refusal to allow the entry of Russian troops into their territories, even for the purpose of assisting resistance to a possible German attack.  German-Soviet negotiations had been taking place since June, and on 15 August German Ambassador Schulenberg delivered a message to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stating that Ribbentrop was prepared to visit Moscow in order to bring about a permanent change in German-Soviet relations. Hitler wished Ribbentrop to be received at once, for his plans to invade Poland on 26 August were contingent upon the Soviet response. On 19 August the Soviets indicated their agreement to a meeting on the 26th. Triggers and Responses  The first state to perceive a crisis was Latvia. On 20 August Latvian Foreign Minister Munters received reports of plans for the partition of Eastern Europe between Germany and the Soviet Union. Latvia's representative in Berlin was instructed to obtain a formal statement from the German government that the security, integrity, and independence of the Baltic states would be maintained. Its major response, on 30 August, was a decision at a special meeting of the Latvian cabinet to introduce a number of defense measures, including mobilization.  On 21 August a crisis was triggered for the Soviet Union when Stalin received a personal message from Hitler accepting the Soviet draft for a Non-Aggression Pact and urging an earlier date for the Ribbentrop visit. Stalin interpreted this message as an ultimatum. If the German plan to invade Poland on the 26th was not met by strong action on the part of France and the U.K., Germany would be free to impose its views on the USSR. After short deliberations, Stalin agreed to Ribbentrop's arrival on 23 August. The signing of a Non-Aggression Treaty with Germany on 23 August was the USSR's major response.  On the evening of 21 August word was received in the capitals of Japan, Poland, and the U.K. that negotiations between Germany and the USSR for a Non-Aggression Pact were about to be concluded. Japan's Ambassador to Berlin, Oshima, protested to Germany that it would be an act of bad faith and a contravention of the Anti-Comintern Pact. At that time, a full-scale war was raging between Japan and the Soviet Union at Nomonhan (see Case #72, in Asia: Non-PCs), and the Japanese feared that the USSR would take advantage of their strengthened international position to exert added pressure on Japan in Asia. The Hiranuma cabinet responded by instructing Oshima to make a formal protest to the German government, which was delivered on 26 August.  In the U.K., news of the Pact was accompanied by reports of German troop movements toward the Polish frontier. At a cabinet meeting the following day, members decided on partial mobilization and a call to convene parliament on the 24th. The British were faced with a fait accompli, their inability to reach an agreement with Moscow; and the existence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact did not alter the U.K.'s obligations to Poland. On 22 and 23 August Notes were exchanged between Chamberlain and Hitler, and on 25 August Hitler demanded that a Polish emissary arrive in Berlin within 24 hours. The British cabinet considered this unreasonable and refused to recommend to Poland that it comply with this demand. Diplomatic efforts continued until 1 September when German forces crossed the Polish frontier and began their invasion. On the 2nd the U.K. sent an ultimatum to Hitler, after no reply had been received to its Note of the previous day, offering to negotiate if German forces were withdrawn from Poland. And on the 3rd the U.K. declared war on Germany.  The impending Ribbentrop journey to Moscow was broadcast by Moscow Radio on 22 August. This news triggered a crisis for Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and Switzerland.  In Australia, Prime Minister Menzies stated on the 23rd that, if Britain were forced to go to war, it would not be alone. The following day Menzies issued a declaration confirming the unity in the ranks of the British Empire. The Australian response was Menzies's declaration of war on 3 September.  Belgium's King Leopold, addressing the Oslo powers (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) on 23 August, appealed to the major powers to maintain peace. On the 25th, at a meeting of Belgium's Council of Ministers, it was decided to place the Belgian forces at home on a war footing: active divisions and first reserves were mobilized, automobiles and horses were requisitioned, and frontier patrols were posted. That day the prime minister gave the German chargé d'affaires assurances that the actions of the Belgian government constituted an affirmation of its independence and its wish to stay out of any conflict.  On 23 August Canada's Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, declared that parliament would be summoned the moment the situation required it, stating that the powers of the War Reserve Act would be utilized to place Canada on a war footing. On the 26th Canada's foreign minister sent identical appeals to Germany, Poland, and Italy urging the avoidance of war and the solving of issues through conference and negotiation. The Canadian major response to the crisis was at an emergency cabinet meeting on 1 September. Canada vowed to stand by Britain. The mobilization of army and navy forces was to be completed, and measures were taken for Canada's defense and the granting of aid to Britain. On the 10th Canada declared war on Germany.  Despite a Non-Aggression Pact signed with Germany in May 1939, the 22 August announcement triggered a crisis for Denmark, which sought assurances from both Germany and the U.K. that its neutrality would be respected. On the 28th these assurances were given by Germany, and on the 30th by the U.K. Denmark's major response came on 1 September when the Rigodag met to ensure that Danish forces were adequate to carry out the task of protecting the country's neutrality.  A large concentration of Soviet troops stationed along the Estonian/USSR border posed a serious threat to Estonia. In the hope of maintaining German guarantees, Foreign Minister Selter responded to the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact by offering congratulations to the German government and stating his conviction that Germany, according to its Non-Aggression Treaties with Estonia and the Soviet Union, had prepared the ground for ensuring Estonian security.  For Finland, the assumption that permanent hostility between Germany and the Soviet Union would maintain a balance of power in the Baltic region was shattered on 22 August. Foreign Minister Errko feared that the signatories of the Pact would turn against neighboring Baltic states at a later date. The German ambassador to Helsinki was called in on 1 September with a request for assurances that Germany would respect Finland's neutrality; these were given.  In France, word of the Pact on 22 August produced a response of partial mobilization. All frontier troops were put on alert on the 23rd, and full mobilization of reserves began on the 24th. Hitler and Prime Minister Daladier exchanged letters on 25 and 27 August. France agreed to come to Poland's aid if it were attacked by Germany. After the attack on 1 September, the French Council of Ministers ordered a general mobilization for the following day. France, like Britain, sent an ultimatum to Hitler on the 2nd, to expire the next day. And on the 3rd France, too, declared war on Germany.  Lithuania viewed the Pact as a threat to its existence, despite the Non-Aggression Pacts that Lithuania, together with Latvia and Estonia, had signed with Germany and with the Soviet Union. Lithuania's response was a declaration of neutrality on 2 September.  Luxembourg attended the Oslo Powers Conference on 23 August, which called for peace. Its major response was an appeal on 31 August for the observance of Luxembourg's neutrality.  The response of the Netherlands was a cabinet decision on 25 August to maintain neutrality. The following day the German minister met with Queen Wilhelmina and conveyed German expectations that the Netherlands would not swerve from the neutrality decision. On the 28th a mobilization order was proclaimed, along with other measures for Holland's security. On 30 August assurances were also received from the U.K.  New Zealand, like other members of the British Commonwealth, perceived a crisis on 22 August when the grave threat facing the U.K. as a result of the Pact became known. The following day, with cabinet approval, Acting Premier Frazer declared that New Zealand would remain solidly behind Britain should war come. A state of emergency was proclaimed on 1 September; and war declared on the 3rd.  Ribbentrop's proposed journey to Moscow also became known in Norway on the 22nd. Norway responded on the 30th with an order for partial mobilization. Assurances of Germany's respect for Norway's neutrality were sought and received on 1 September.  After reports of extensive German military preparations on the 23rd, Poland mobilized one-third of its army. On 24 August, Foreign Minister Beck told the British ambassador that he considered the situation most grave. The following day the Anglo-Polish Agreement was signed. As further German troop concentrations were reported on the border, and German troops in Slovakia called upon the population to collaborate against Poland, the Polish government decided upon general mobilization on 29 August. It was announced on the 30th, despite the advice of the French and British ambassadors, whose countries were still negotiating with Germany. When the invasion took place, Poland's major response, on 1 September, was to fight the invaders while appealing to Britain and France to implement their guarantees.  Romania, caught between the two strongest powers in Europe, viewed the Pact as a grave threat to its sovereignty. Romania particularly feared Russian designs on Bessarabia and the implications for Romania's freedom of movement on behalf of Poland in the event of war. On 27 August Foreign Minister Gafencu told the German ambassador that Romania was determined to remain neutral even if France and Britain became involved in a war with Germany. On the 28th Romania began to fortify its frontier with the USSR along the valley of the Dniester River.  On 27th August Sweden responded to the crisis with a decision to maintain strict neutrality. A partial mobilization had been called on the previous day. On 1 September the king declared that all defense positions would be strengthened.  Switzerland's geographic position, bordering Germany, France, Austria, and Italy, placed it in an especially vulnerable position on 22 August. On the 28th the Bundesrat ordered the mobilization of frontier forces and all defense troops. Parliament was summoned the following day for a special session. On 30 August the United Federal Assembly appointed General Henri Guisan as Commander in Chief of the Swiss army. And the following day Switzerland reaffirmed its neutrality.  The German invasion of Poland on 1 September triggered a crisis for South Africa. The Hertzog-Smuts coalition was split over the question of South Africa's response to the crisis. Hertzog advocated neutrality, maintaining that the dispute was among the European powers and did not affect South Africa. General Smuts believed that South Africa should enter the war on the side of the U.K. The issue was placed before the House of Assembly. When no solution was forthcoming Prime Minister Hertzog requested the governor-general to dissolve parliament and call an election. The request was refused, the prime minister resigned, and the governor-general asked Smuts to form a cabinet. South Africa's major response was to declare war against Germany on 6 September.  Terminations Japan's crisis ended on 28 August with the resignation of the Hiranuma cabinet.  On 31 August the crisis for Switzerland terminated when the Federal Council issued a declaration of neutrality after assurances had been received from Germany and Italy. On that day as well, Luxembourg's crisis ended when it, too, received assurances of German observance of its strict neutrality.  On 1 September there were official declarations of neutrality by the Scandinavian countries--Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden; Romania, too, declared neutrality that day, as did Estonia and Latvia.  Lithuania proclaimed neutrality the next day. Neutrality was declared by Belgium and the Netherlands on 3 September.  Australia, Britain, France, and New Zealand declared war against Germany on 3 September.  South Africa joined the war on the 6th, and Canada on the 10th.  Germany fought in Poland for 17 days. The conquest was completed on 17 September. That day the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, meeting the advancing German troops near Brest-Litovsk two days later.  The last actor to perceive crisis termination was the Soviet Union, on 28 September 1939. Despite the signing of the Pact, bad faith continued to exist between Germany and the USSR until additional agreements were signed on the 28th when the German and Soviet governments divided Poland.  By the end of this crisis, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. were at war with Germany. Poland had been conquered. The Scandinavian countries, the Baltic states, and Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania, Switzerland, and Holland had declared neutrality. Japan was at war in Asia with China. And Moscow was serene in the misconception that Germany would not attack the USSR.  The League of Nations, although formally still in existence until 1946, had become moribund by 1939 and was not involved in any crisis during the long-war World War II PC.
A crisis for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania occurred between 26 September and 10 October 1939. The three Baltic states had asserted their independence from Russia in November 1918 (see Case #4, Baltic Independence), and maintained their independence during the inter-world war period.  The German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 was followed by a Soviet invasion of that country on 17 September. By the end of that month Poland had been divided between Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviets occupied 77,620 square miles of eastern Poland. Lithuania and Slovakia received small parts of Polish territory. On 22 September the Estonian Foreign Minister, Karl Selter, went to Moscow for negotiations on economic issues. While there, a demand was made that Estonia sign a mutual assistance pact that would grant the USSR a naval base and airfields in the then-independent state. Foreign Minister Molotov threatened Selter that, if the Estonian government refused to comply, Soviet demands would be obtained through other methods. On 26 September 1939 Selter informed his government of the Soviet demands, triggering a crisis for Estonia. This was accompanied by extensive flights of Soviet aircraft over Estonian territory and rumors of large Russian troop concentrations along the border. Estonia responded on the 28th by complying with the demands thereby ending its crisis.  On 1 October the Latvian Foreign Minister, Wilhelm Munters, was summoned to Moscow for discussions. He arrived on the 2nd and held conversations with Stalin and Molotov. A crisis was triggered the next day when the Soviets made a series of demands under the threat of war. Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Joseph Urbsys, arrived in Moscow on the 3rd as well, to receive similar demands, triggering a crisis for Lithuania. Latvia, realizing that British or French assistance was out of the question at that time, and aware of the fact that 16 Soviet divisions were concentrated on the Latvian border, responded by signing a mutual assistance pact on 5 October. This marked the end of Latvia's crisis. The pact allowed the USSR to gain control over the Gulf of Riga and several air and naval bases. Thirty thousand Soviet troops were to be garrisoned in Latvia.  Negotiations between the USSR and Lithuania were conducted for a week after the trigger date, with Moscow applying severe pressure. The Soviet-Lithuanian Pact, ending the crisis, was signed on 10 October. It provided for the restoration of the city of Vilna to Lithuania and allowed the USSR to establish air and land bases and to maintain 20,000 troops in Lithuania. Lithuania, while viewing the return of Vilna with much satisfaction, had become a Soviet satellite.  By that time the League of Nations had become an empty shell.  (The Soviet [and, after 1991, Russian] occupation of the Baltic states lasted 54 years, with as many as 200,000 troops. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia became independent in 1992. The withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania was completed in 1993, and from Latvia and Estonia on 31 August 1994.)
A crisis for Finland, Sweden, France, and the U.K., centering on the Finnish/Russian War, began on 6 October 1939 and ended on 13 March 1940. The city of St. Petersburg is 32 kilometers from the Finnish border, south of the Karelian Peninsula. Treaties signed by the Soviet Union with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in September and October 1939 granted Moscow the right to build bases in the three Baltic states (see Case #75--Soviet Occupation--Baltic, in Europe: Non-PCs). In addition to a base in Estonia at the southwestern edge of the Gulf of Finland, the Soviets wanted a base at the northern end, along with territorial changes that would protect it from future attack, either by the U.K. or Germany. From early 1938 until mid-1939 requests for such border changes had been discussed by Soviet diplomats in Helsinki with the Finnish foreign minister. Pressure on Finland began once the treaties with the Baltic states had been signed. On 5 October Molotov requested the Finnish ambassador to the Soviet Union to inform his government that the USSR wished the Finnish foreign minister or some high-ranking delegate to come to Moscow to discuss concrete political questions in view of the altered international situation--the outbreak of World War II and the German-Soviet partition of Poland. In the absence of a reply by 6 October strong pressure was applied to the ambassador of Finland. A crisis was triggered for Finland when its ambassador in Moscow related the Soviet demands the same day. A negotiator was selected by Finland with clear instructions to convey its determination to stand firm. And Moscow was so informed on the 10th. The same day Finland called for partial mobilization and evacuation of some cities, along with a practice air raid and blackout in Helsinki.  Negotiations took place between 12 and 14 October. The Soviets presented their "minimum demands," which included the transfer of islands close to the USSR shore and the port of Itanko, moving the border 35 kilometers farther away from St. Petersburg; and concessions in the northern peninsula of Rybachi, including the port of Petsamo. The Finnish mission returned to Helsinki for further instructions. On 27 October Finland appealed to Sweden for military aid in case of war. The following day the appeal was rejected by the prime minister of Sweden. The last round of negotiations produced lesser Soviet demands, but Helsinki refused to consider them. The negotiators returned to Finland on 14 November.  An incident involving the firing of seven shots occurred in a town on the Soviet side of the Karelian border on 26 November. Moscow accused Finland of violating their Non-Aggression Pact; and a vehement press campaign was launched against Finland. The Soviets refused Finland's request to investigate the incident and withdrew its diplomats on 29 November, denouncing the Pact. On the 30th the USSR attacked Finland. The Finnish cabinet declared a state of war that day and appointed Marshal Mannerheim Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The government resigned on 1 December and was reorganized under a new Prime Minister, Ryti. On the 2nd the Soviet Union set up and recognized a Finnish Democratic Government in captured territory. The same day Finland appealed to the League of Nations, which invited the Soviet Union to attend an Assembly session. Moscow refused on 4 December; and on the 14th the League Assembly condemned the Soviet Union as an aggressor and requested that members give Finland material and humanitarian aid. The Soviet Union was expelled from the League, by then an empty shell.  During December France and the U.K. began to consider sending forces to aid Finland, with a view to stopping the flow of Swedish iron shipments through Narvik to Germany. In order to do this troops had to cross neutral Norway and Sweden. Sweden, physically closer to Finland and politically friendly, saw the situation as dangerous and feared being drawn into the conflict, particularly with Germany. When the first official offer by Britain and France to send troops to Finland via Sweden was made on 27 December 1939, a crisis was triggered for Sweden which, together with Norway, insisted that no troops pass through its territories. On 4 January the German ambassador to Finland made it clear that Germany would view Allied troops in northern Sweden and Norway as a casus belli. The Soviets, who had been surprised at Finnish perseverance and success, finally broke Finland's line on 14 January 1940, triggering a crisis for France and the U.K.: they were suddenly faced with the real prospect of a Soviet victory in a strategic area and a need to send aid to Finland before the spring thaw shifted the military conditions once more. They responded on 5 February with a finalized plan for action in Finland which was accepted by the Joint Allied Supreme War Council.  Sweden, which had been brokering negotiations between the Finnish foreign minister and the Soviet ambassador to Sweden, became more alarmed over the Allied plans. A press-leaked story about the negotiations and appeals from Finland for aid determined the Swedish major response to the crisis: on 19 February the king of Sweden officially refused to aid Finland. Throughout February and March, Britain and France continued to ignore Sweden's and Norway's refusals to grant passage for their troops and pressed Finland to accept Allied armies on its soil. Finland preferred to continue negotiations for an armistice with the Soviet Union via Sweden.  Moscow, which had originally expected little resistance and popular support for a communist government in Finland, finally agreed to an armistice while demanding stiffer conditions. The armistice was signed on 13 March 1940, terminating the crisis for all four actors.  Offers to mediate were made by the United States, Italy, and Germany.
The German invasion of Scandinavia generated a crisis for Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and the U.K. from 8 April to 10 June 1940. The Finnish War (see Case #76, in Finland/Russia PC), which had ended in March 1940, emphasized the strategic importance of Scandinavia's waterways for both the Allies and Germany. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, pressed for the mining of Norwegian waters, which were the passageway for Swedish ore to Germany. Early in 1940 the German tanker Altmark, sailing in Norwegian waters and carrying British prisoners of war, was boarded by the British while moored in Jossingfjord, and the prisoners were released. Both Norway and Germany issued strong protests to London. Norway, which feared German retaliation, emphasized that the British ships had violated its neutrality. The Altmark incident accelerated German plans for the invasion of Norway and spurred British cabinet approval of Churchill's naval plans. Due to Britain's superior naval strength, Germany decided upon a surprise attack against Norway. On 8 April 1940 a crisis was triggered for Norway when it received intelligence reports predicting a German invasion the next day. Several U.K. vessels did spot and engage the Germans that day, but the British viewed these as isolated clashes. On 9 April the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway, creating a crisis for Denmark, France, and the U.K. A crisis was also triggered for the Netherlands, which perceived the invasion as presaging an attack on Holland, for it was the first German offensive since the "phony war" of the preceding winter and spring and was accompanied by perceptions of German plans to attack Western Europe. While Denmark and Norway perceived no more than grave damage at the outset, for Germany demanded free passage only, as the crisis escalated they perceived a threat to their existence in the form of German occupation.  The Norwegian and Danish responses occurred on 9 April. Norway's King Haakon offered to abdicate rather than capitulate. Norway reorganized its defenses and began strong resistance under a new Commander in Chief, General Ruge. Denmark held cabinet meetings with King Christian and, under his leadership, decided not to resist, ending its crisis on the 9th.  The U.K. and France had been considering the dispatch of troops to aid Norway. The German attack hastened their decision, on 13 April, to do so. Haphazard and insufficient planning prevented the success of the operation. The target areas were too narrow for the ships carrying artillery to land, and the landing sites were changed, confusing the troops. Norwegian forces had tried to keep landing areas and key ports free for the Allies.  On 19 April the Netherlands responded to the crisis by mobilizing its troops and issuing a strong statement of its intention to defend itself against German attack. Holland's tension eased as the German invasion concentrated on Denmark and Norway and, on 27 April, its crisis ended, with military preparations returning to normal.  The Anglo-French forces, together with the Norwegians, resisted for another month. In the interim, on 10 May, Britain's Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, resigned and was replaced by Winston Churchill. By the end of May the Allies had been badly beaten, and a decision was made to withdraw. The last troops were evacuated on 8 June 1940, following the French defeat in northern France (see Case #78), terminating the intrawar crisis for France and Britain. The king of Norway and his government left the country with the British and French on the 8th, and, on 10 June, a member of General Ruge's staff signed an armistice with Germany, ending the last fighting around Narvik and terminating the crisis for Norway.
The crisis over Germany's occupation of Western Europe occurred from 10 May to 22 June 1940. Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, and France were the crisis actors. On 9 April 1940 German armed forces occupied Denmark and invaded Norway (see Case #77). Early in the morning of 10 May 1940 German armies, without warning, invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, triggering a crisis for those three countries and for France and Britain. The latter were cobelligerent partners in the ongoing European war; the cornerstone of Britain's defense policy had always been that a threat to France was perceived in London as a threat to itself. Thus, on 10 May, they responded by dispatching expeditionary forces into Belgium to cooperate with the Belgian army in its resistance. Diplomatic negotiations were also carried on. Belgium and the Netherlands responded on the 10th as well with military resistance. In Luxembourg there was no fighting.  The royal family retired to its castle, refusing to communicate with the German invaders, and its crisis ended on the day of the invasion. In Holland, Rotterdam surrendered to the Germans after a fierce air attack, and the government, headed by Queen Wilhelmina, escaped to London on 13 May. Holland signed an armistice agreement with the Germans on 15 May 1940.  Between 17 and 21 May German mechanized divisions drove deep into northern France and succeeded in separating British and Belgian forces in Flanders from the main French armies. The fall of Brussels forced the British and Belgian troops back to Ostend and Dunkirk. On 26 May Boulogne fell to the Germans, and King Leopold ordered his army to capitulate. This was done on 28 May, terminating the crisis for Belgium. Two hundred and fifty thousand British troops were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk.  A broad attack on France was launched on 5 June. On the l0th Italy declared war against France and Britain. Paris was evacuated on the l3th. And on 17 June the U.K. crisis ended when it formally withdrew its troops from France and agreed to the latter's making a separate peace with the Germans. On that day Marshal Petain asked the Germans for an armistice. This was signed on 22 June 1940 ending the crisis for France and leaving three-fifths of the country under German occupation.  An immediate legacy of this intrawar crisis was a near confrontation between Britain and Vichy France as a result of the former's fear that the French fleet concentrated in Toulon would be handed over to Germany. The British signaled their determination to prevent this by sinking the French naval flotilla in Oran, North Africa, on 3 July 1940. The U.K. remained suspicious of Petain's intentions throughout the tenure of the Vichy French regime, as evident in the Mid-East Campaign crisis of 1941 (see Case #84).
The closure of the Burma Road by the Japanese created a crisis for the U.K. from 24 June to 14 July 1940. Throughout the 1930s Britain's support for the Nationalist regime in China was viewed by Japan as hostile to its interests. Britain's involvement in the European war provided Japan with an opportunity to proceed without hindrance to establish its proclaimed "New Order"--the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." As the tide of the war turned against Britain, Japan increased its pressure. On 24 June Japan demanded that the U.K. cease assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, withdraw its troops from Shanghai, and close the transit routes for supplies to China through Hong Kong and the Burma Road. A force of about 5,000 Japanese troops took up positions along the border of the leased Kowloon territory in Hong Kong. The British perceived that, if they yielded to the Japanese demands, the security of the British Commonwealth would be compromised. Yet Britain could not afford to risk war with Japan, being already involved in the European and Mediterranean theaters.  The U.K.'s major response, on 27 June, was to seek American assurances that the U.S. would stand by Britain in resisting Japanese demands, either through an embargo on all exports to Japan or by sending U.S. warships to Singapore. The U.K. also requested U.S. cooperation in mediating a peace settlement between China and Japan. The U.S., while urging the U.K. to stand firm, rejected any plan for joint action. On the 30th the Hong Kong military authorities ordered the destruction of the frontier rail and road bridges over the Shumchun River. An evacuation of British women and children from Hong Kong to Manila and Australia followed.  A Japanese foreign ministry communiqué, on 8 July, demanded British reconsideration. On the 12th the U.K. informed U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull that Japan would declare war at any time unless the British government closed the Burma Road.  The crisis ended on 14 July 1940 when an Anglo-Japanese agreement was reached in Tokyo whereby all transit of war materials was stopped for three months. Four days later the agreement was communicated to the British parliament by the prime minister and the foreign secretary. The U.K., perceiving a high probability that Japan would enter the war on the side of the Axis, and unable to meet the threat without U.S. support, yielded to the Japanese demands.  (The Burma Road was cleared of Japanese forces in the spring of 1945 following a two-pronged attack on Japanese positions in northern Burma by Chinese troops under the direction of U.S. General Stilwell.)
Romania's crises over Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Soviet claims on its territories occurred between 26 June and 7 September 1940. After World War I Romania received disputed territories claimed by several of its neighbors, including the USSR, Hungary, and Bulgaria. In July 1935 Romania signed a Pact of Non-Aggression with the Soviet Union that involved tacit recognition of Romania's possession of Bessarabia and was the direct result of Hitler's election victory in Germany and Moscow's preoccupation with the situation in the Far East. The fall of France and the desperate position of Britain in the summer of 1940 (see Cases #78--Fall of Western Europe; and #81--Battle of Britain, in Multiregional PCs: World War II) caused shifts in the European balance that emphasized Romania's vulnerability. The USSR, in talks with Germany, indicated that it could no longer wait to solve the problem of Bessarabia, which had been Russian from 1812 to 1918. It became clear that, if one power pressed claims on Romania, others would seize the opportunity to follow suit. Both Hungary and Romania viewed Transylvania as an integral part of their history and territory. And Bulgaria had long been voicing its claims to southern Dobruja. On 26 June 1940 Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov handed the Romanian ambassador in Moscow a 24-hour ultimatum to evacuate Bessarabia. Further, as compensation for the years of loss, the USSR demanded northern Bukovina as well. Romania turned for aid to the Balkan Entente, without success, and to Germany, which advised acceptance of Soviet demands as the territories fell under the Soviet sphere according to the August 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement. Romania's major response, on 28 June 1940, was to yield. Nevertheless, military preparations and mobilization were also carried out. Advancing Soviet troops went beyond the areas designated in the agreement, and some minor clashes with Romanian forces occurred. Ultimately, the Soviets withdrew to the agreed boundaries and, on 2 July, the operation was completed, terminating Romania's crisis with the Soviet Union.  Encouraged by the Soviet victory, the Hungarian Nazi Party accused Romania, on 1 July 1940, of evicting Hungarians to make room for Bessarabian refugees, triggering Romania's crisis with Hungary over Transylvania. Hungarian leaders conferred with Hitler and Italy's Foreign Minister Ciano, where they were advised to attack only if there appeared to be no other way to achieve their aims. Romania compromised with a plan for a population exchange and some territorial concessions, but these were rejected. Its major response, on 13 July 1940, was an offer by King Carol to Hitler for an offensive-defensive alliance, clearly aimed at the possibility of receiving German support against Hungary, and a movement of troops. Hitler replied, on the 15th, that Romania must come to terms with Hungary. On 26-27 July Romania, upon the advice of Hitler and Mussolini, agreed to negotiate.  Meanwhile, in July, minor clashes occurred on the Bulgarian-Romanian border in connection with the Bessarabian refugees, and another crisis was triggered for Romania, this time with Bulgaria. While Romanian representatives met with Mussolini on 27 July, Hitler proposed negotiations to the Bulgarians. On 4 August 1940 Romania's major response to the Bulgarian crisis was to send a delegate to Germany empowered to open talks with the Bulgarians. A meeting was held on the 19th. As Bulgaria's claim was less drastic and generally justified, agreement was reached quickly. On 21 August, southern Dobruja was transferred. The formal agreement was signed on 7 September 1940 terminating Romania's crisis with Bulgaria.  The Hungarian claims were far more complex. After meetings on 16 and 24 August, negotiations broke off and both sides mobilized. Hungary's decision to invade followed air skirmishes. On 26 August German intervention was suggested by Ribbentrop. The following day, Hitler himself worked out the boundaries, and, on the 29th, he called upon Hungary and Romania to send envoys to Vienna. At the meeting Hungarian protests of inadequacies were shouted down while Romania's shock was simply ignored. Neither side had any real choice. After consulting the Crown Council, the Romanian minister accepted the terms of Hitler's imposed solution on 30 August 1940, terminating the crisis with Hungary. In return, Hungary was obliged to grant its German minority a privileged status, amounting to pro-Reich autonomy. The borders remained stable for several years as the war progressed.  Although the League of Nations existed, formally, it was not involved.
The battle, an intrawar crisis for the U.K., took place from 10 July to 15 September 1940. A Naval Agreement between the U.K. and Germany in 1935 and British concessions at Munich in 1938 (see Case #64, in Czech./Germany PC) led Hitler to expect U.K. cooperation for a quiet Western flank which would enable him to carry out a massive attack on the USSR. After Britain's declaration of war and Churchill's announcement, following the fall of France (see Case #78), that Britain would continue to fight alone, Hitler began to formulate a plan to invade the U.K. He envisioned a long and costly campaign requiring at the outset the transport of around 30-40 divisions by sea across the Channel. Since Germany lacked sufficient naval power to compete with Britain, the prerequisite to a successful crossing was absolute air superiority. As German ships began to collect along the coast of France, the Luftwaffe initiated its efforts to gain control of the air. After the fall of France and the Dunkirk evacuation, the U.K. appealed to the U.S. for military supplies. By the end of June U.S. guns and ammunition had reached British shores. In early July the Germans occupied islands in the English Channel. On 10 July 1940 the Luftwaffe began "Operation Eagle" by attacking towns near the coast of Britain. The U.K.'s response to the crisis was immediate, through RAF counterattacks. The German assault continued during July and August with fierce RAF opposition. On 8 August German planes bombed airfields and vital industries. On the 15th 1,000 German planes ranged as far north as Scotland. The British retaliated with raids on Berlin, Dusseldorf, Essen, and other German cities. On 3 September a defense agreement was concluded between the U.K. and the U.S. The 7th marked the highest British casualty count. And on 11 September the U.K. began continuous bombing of continental ports to frustrate German invasion preparations, including the assembling of ships for the future crossing of the English Channel.  As time went on it became clear that the Luftwaffe would not be able to gain complete air superiority. And the original target date for the German invasion ("Operation Sea Lion") was postponed several times. The Luftwaffe's strategy had been to draw the U.K.'s Fighter Command into a major engagement, first over the English Channel and then, on 15 September 1940, in a mass raid on London in an effort to deliver a final assault. The British resisted, preserved the Fighter Command by meeting the German attacks with a minimum of force, and pushed the Luftwaffe back across the Channel. This victory of 15 September 1940, proving that the RAF was still master of the skies over Britain, marked the termination of Britain's crisis, though night bombing of London and other British cities continued far into the winter.  Once the conditions for a successful German landing had been denied, Germany canceled the invasion plans. Hitler decided to proceed with an attack in the east without the subjugation of Britain. Italy dispatched an air force division--after the crisis proper had ended.
The U.K. and Italy were the crisis actors in an IWC from 19 August 1940 until 17 May 1941. On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on Britain in the belief that the impending collapse of the Allies in Europe would make any serious Italian participation unnecessary. With the expected downfall of the British, Egypt, British Somaliland, and British East Africa would be added to Italy's existing possessions covering an immense area in northeast Africa. When Italy entered the war, the reinforcement of British forces through the Mediterranean became extremely dangerous. This threat intensified in July when the collapse of opposition in French Somaliland led to a French-Italian armistice. Large Italian forces had now been released for use against British Somaliland. During July Italy occupied Sudanese and Kenyan frontier posts. On 3 August the Italians crossed the frontier into British Somaliland. On 19 August 1940 the British were forced to evacuate British Somaliland. This setback at the hands of the Italians came as a shock to British public opinion. Although Italian attacks on Aden were now more easily facilitated, the protectorate had no significant strategic value for the U.K. Nevertheless, the location of an Italian East Africa on the flank of Britain's vital sea route, the Red Sea, was a threat to Britain's influence among its client states, and the forced evacuation triggered a crisis for the U.K. The British responded, months later, on 2 December 1940, with a decision to expel Italy from East Africa. The campaign in North Africa began on 8 December. The East African offensive began in February 1941 when the British advanced from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Kenya into Ethiopia and Eritrea.  On 13 February Kismayu fell, and Mogadiscio (Mogadishu) submitted on the 25th. And on 17 March the Italians abandoned Sigjiga. The British advances had revealed the weakness of the Italian colonial forces, and internal disorder increased greatly. On the 22nd Neghelli in southern Ethiopia was occupied by British and Ethiopian forces.  The crisis trigger for Italy was at the Battle of Keren on 27 March 1941. The loss of 3,000 men in that battle broke the back of Italian resistance, which now abandoned hope of retaining control over Eritrea. Italy responded on 30 March with a decision to concentrate resistance at Amba Alagi. Mussolini was so informed by the Duke of Aosta, Supreme Commander of all Italian armed forces in East Africa. On 3 April the duke united the remainder of his reserve force with the remnants of the Italian Eritrean army.  On 6 April Addis Ababa capitulated. Prior to the defeat, Mussolini had instructed the duke not to abandon the capital unless absolutely necessary because it would be politically equivalent to losing the empire.  On 11 April President Roosevelt announced that the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden were no longer combat zones within the meaning of U.S. neutrality and U.S. vessels could now carry war supplies to the British Middle East forces by this route.  The termination of the crisis for both the U.K. and Italy came on 17 May 1941 when the Duke of Aosta surrendered and signed an armistice agreement. Italian resistance in Eritrea collapsed by June. And before the end of 1941 all of East Africa was under British control.
The Italian and German invasions of the Balkans created a crisis for Greece, Yugoslavia, the U.K., Turkey, Italy, and Germany. The duration of the crisis was from 28 October 1940 until 1 June 1941. The high geostrategic importance of the Balkans for Germany, the USSR, and the West stems from the fact that they guarded one access to the Mediterranean close to vital areas of the British Empire, namely, the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Together with Turkey and Romania, the Balkans dominate the Dardanelles, the access to the USSR and the Black Sea, and the mouth of the Danube River. They are also rich in natural resources, especially oil. In the summer of 1940, when three countries claimed Romanian territories, Hitler imposed a solution on Romania and Hungary in order to avoid war (see Case #80, in Europe: Non-PCs). On 8 October German troops entered Romania to "protect" the oil fields. Italy had long been interested in Yugoslavia and Greece as guardians of the opposite shore of the Adriatic, and Hitler had cautiously granted Mussolini a free hand in the area. When Italy attacked and occupied Albania in early 1939 (see Case #71--Invasion of Albania, in Italy/Albania/Yugoslavia PC), the balance in the area was altered. Mussolini, after a poor showing on the French front and ignorant of Hitler's plan vis-à-vis Romania, wished to present Hitler with a fait accompli by occupying Greece. On 28 October 1940 Italy's ambassador to Greece presented Premier Metaxas with an ultimatum to relinquish Greek bases for use by the Italian government. One-half hour before the ultimatum expired, Italy attacked Greece from Albania. Greece responded that day by mobilizing its forces and appealing to the U.K. for help under its guarantee, triggering a crisis for the U.K. Britain perceived a threat to the strategic balance in the area and therefore to its entire Middle East empire. Crises were also triggered for Yugoslavia, which feared for its own security should the port of Thessaloniki, Greece be occupied by the Italians, and for Turkey, which viewed Bulgaria as capable of seizing the military opportunity to take control of Greek areas of strategic importance to Turkey, as well as fearing a spillover that would endanger Turkey's neutral status.  Yugoslavia and Turkey both responded on 1 November. Yugoslavia held a meeting of its Crown Council and ordered partial mobilization. Turkey's President Inönü announced that his country would stand by its allies and not tolerate a threat to its security. To back this up some Turkish troops were moved to the Bulgarian border--which ultimately freed Greek soldiers, fighting in the vicinity, for campaigns elsewhere in Greece. The U.K., which had sent reinforcements to Crete and other Greek islands on 30 October, decided at a cabinet meeting on 3 November to increase its military and economic aid to Greece so as to enable that country to resist the Italian offensive.  The attack itself did not go well for Italy. Severe winter conditions and the fierce determination of the Greek forces ground the Italian offensive to a standstill. By the middle of November the Greeks were able to reorganize for an offensive, which, by 21 November, had forced the Italians back. The first crisis for Greece and Yugoslavia ended that day. The U.K.'s first crisis ended the following day, with the news of Greek successes on the battlefield.  The Greek offensive, which resulted, inter alia, in the capture of the strategic town of Koritsa, triggered a crisis for Italy and Germany. Hitler viewed Italian losses as detrimental to his strategy in the area, for Western victories would allow the British access to the Balkans and the Romanian oil fields. Italy responded on 5 December by sending its ambassador in Berlin to Hitler to request aid in Greece. Although the request was later withdrawn, Hitler had been convinced of the need to salvage the situation there. Accordingly, on 13 December, Germany began to plan for an invasion of Greece in February. It was eventually delayed until April. Germany's Soviet campaign was thus also delayed.  By the beginning of 1941 the military situation had stabilized somewhat. Hitler spent the winter in political maneuvering, easing the tension between Bulgaria and Turkey and countering strong British pressure on Turkey to support Greece. Hitler was instrumental in bringing about the signing of a Bulgaria-Turkey Friendship Pact on 17 February 1941, which terminated Turkey's crisis vis-à-vis Bulgaria. On 29 February Bulgaria adhered to the Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) and therewith allowed German troops to assemble on its territory to await the invasion of Greece.  In Yugoslavia the same German pressure was being applied, and there also was popular unrest and some civil violence as rival groups maneuvered for dominance in that multinational state. The Regent, Prince Paul, though willing in principle to join the Axis powers, did not wish it to become public knowledge. Nevertheless, he obligated Yugoslavia to provide forces, if necessary, and allowed the passage of German troops. On 4 March 1941 Prince Paul visited Hitler where he experienced strong pressure to adhere to the Tripartite Pact. This triggered a second crisis for Yugoslavia, as Germany threatened to occupy Thessaloniki, Greece and hand it over to Bulgaria or Italy. On 24 March 1941 Yugoslavia responded by agreeing to join the Pact, which was done the following day. On the night of the 26th a coup d'état took place in Yugoslavia. The new rulers were quick to state that they would adhere to previous policy, but the signs were unclear. Hitler, in fury, decided to invade Yugoslavia as well as Greece and did so on 6 April 1941, triggering a second crisis for Greece and the U.K. Efforts to coordinate military plans between the U.K. and Greece had met with difficulties. Greece feared that too much British aid would bring Germany into the battle. The U.K. felt that what was acceptable to Greece was insufficient. Poor coordination and misunderstanding led to poor performance.  On 7 April the British pledged military support to Yugoslavia, and on the 8th the U.S. cabled Belgrade that it would provide material aid. Two days later, with a preliminary U.K. withdrawal in Greece, Hungary invaded Yugoslavia. The Greek response to the second crisis was a major withdrawal on 12 April. On 17 April Yugoslavia signed an armistice with Germany, which terminated its second crisis. And on the 23rd Greece surrendered, ending its crisis and that of Italy as well. The next day the Greek government requested that the British withdraw, and Bulgaria invaded Greece. The major U.K. response was a decision on 27 April to withdraw its forces to Crete.  Fighting continued as German forces attacked Crete, which had never been properly fortified. Nonetheless, it took over a month to force a final U.K. withdrawal from Crete, on 1 June, terminating the crisis for the U.K. and for Germany--and this IWC as a whole. In the final analysis the Balkan campaign delayed "Operation Barbarossa" by at least four weeks, more likely several months (see Case #85).  The U.S. sent a delegation to the Balkans in the spring and invoked the Neutrality Act in the fall of 1940. Australian and New Zealand troops fought alongside the British.
Military campaigns in the Middle East triggered crises for Iraq, the U.K., Germany, and Vichy France from 29 April to 14 July 1941. At the beginning of 1941 the Middle East comprised an area of great concern to both sides in the European war. With a German-Italian threat to the Suez Canal, the British began to consider the Basra-Baghdad-Palestine route. On 3 April 1941 pro-Axis Rashid Ali staged a coup and reassumed power in Iraq. U.K. losses in the Balkans and Libya had been reflected in the growth of anti-British sentiment in Iraq, heightened by the fact that Baghdad had become the center of pro-Axis intrigue, leading to British fears of German control over Iraq. The British decided that the situation could be restored only by force. Despite Rashid Ali's assurances that he would honor the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, Britain was determined to restore the legitimate government to power in order to safeguard the Allies against Axis intervention in Iraq. On 17 April 1941 a British-Indian military contingent landed in Basra, in accordance with treaty provisions. A second British contingent landed on 29 April 1941, triggering a crisis for Iraq. That day Iraq responded by ordering its forces to Habbaniya, the principal British air base there. With Iraqi artillery surrounding the air base and other forces encircling the compound of the British embassy in Baghdad, on 29 April, a crisis was triggered for the U.K. The following day the Iraqi commander demanded the closure of the base. The British replied that any interference with flights would be treated as an act of war. The ambassador was given full authority to take any steps necessary, including air attacks, to assure the withdrawal of the Iraqis. While Iraq endeavored to take Habbaniya, the British responded with an attack on 1 May. Rashid Ali's early attempts to secure Axis military assistance had been unsuccessful, as Germany was occupied in Greece and in preparing for its attack on the USSR (see Case #85--Barbarossa). Despite German pressure, Turkey refused to allow a transit of arms and troops through its territory. The only open channel left was Vichy-controlled Syria.  On 6 May Iraqi forces retreated from the hills overlooking the Habbaniya base. Troops from Palestine relieved the hard-pressed British garrison. On 12 May Germany came to Iraq's assistance by sending its Syrian-based bombers to attack British airfields in the Mosul region of Iraq. By 30 May the British had succeeded in crushing the rebellion in Iraq. Rashid Ali and his associates fled to Iran, and Iraq sued for an armistice, terminating its crisis. The following day, Germany announced an agreement on military collaboration between the German and Vichy France governments--despite persistent French pressure for German withdrawal from Syrian territory. The crisis ended for Germany when the Luftwaffe detachment from Syria was recalled on 6 June 1941.  On the 8th the British government announced that it would not tolerate Vichy collaboration with the Germans. Free French troops, with support from Imperial forces, entered Syria and Lebanon that day from Palestine, Transjordan, and Iraq, and triggered a crisis for Vichy France. It responded on 17 June with an attack on Quneitra and Marjayun, in the Golan Heights and south Lebanon, respectively. As the Allies began closing in on Damascus on the 20th, Vichy France asked the U.S. to inquire on what terms an armistice might be arranged. On 8 July General Dentz, the Vichy High Commissioner in Syria, received authority to negotiate. An agreement was finally reached on 14 July 1941, terminating the crisis for the U.K. and Vichy France.  (The latter fell in November 1942, when Germany occupied the rest of France.)
The Soviet Union's existence crisis arising from the German invasion culminated in a massive attack on Moscow. It lasted from 22 June to 5 December 1941. The Italo-German campaign in the Balkans ended at the end of May 1941 with a greatly strengthened Axis position. As a result of the conquest of Greece and Crete, the Aegean Sea became unsafe for British ships (see Case #83--Balkan Invasions). On 13 April Soviet and Japanese diplomats signed a Non-Aggression Pact at Moscow. In late May representatives from Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria met with the German high command to coordinate plans to invade Russia. Hitler floated a rumor of Soviet intentions to attack Germany as a pretext for his own premeditated designs against the USSR. On 22 June 1941 the Germans, in a surprise attack, invaded the Soviet Union along a front of 2,000 miles, triggering a crisis for the USSR. Romanian and Finnish troops participated actively with those of Nazi Germany, while Hungary and Bulgaria provided free passage for German troops on their way east. The Soviets responded the same day with fierce resistance but were soon forced into a slow retreat. Prime Minister Churchill promised that the U.K. would extend all possible aid to the Soviets. A Mutual Assistance Pact was concluded between them on 13 July. During the month of July Riga, Latvia's capital, and Smolensk were captured by the Germans. On 19 August the Germans claimed all Ukrainian territory west of the Dnieper River, except Odessa, and on 4 September the siege of Leningrad began. During September Axis forces continued their advance, and by the end of the month the Germans had entered the Crimea on the southern end of the front and had commenced the battle for Moscow. This triggered a short but intense IWC for the USSR, which ended on 29 October, when the Germans were hurled back at the gates of the Soviet capital. Before then, in mid-October, the Soviet government had transferred its headquarters further east, to Kuybyshev.  On 30 October the United States expedited Soviet purchases of promised U.S. supplies by extending the USSR a credit of one billion dollars. This was later supplemented by a Master Lend-Lease Agreement in 1942. In early December the Soviets began a major counterthrust before the gates of Moscow. On 5 December the German high command decided to halt operations on the eastern front for the winter because German troops were exhausted, short of ammunition, suffering from the cold, and beset by logistical problems. The German halt outside of Moscow on 5 December 1941 ended the first stage of Germany's Russian campaign and, with it, the Soviet intrawar crisis over the fate of its capital, as well as the Barbarossa crisis as a whole. Hitler had not fulfilled his objective--defeat of the Soviet Union within three months. Japan adhered to its Pact with the USSR and remained strictly neutral, but two days later launched the Pacific war with an attack on Pearl Harbor (see Case #88).
Ecuador and Peru experienced another crisis over the territory of Marañón from 5 July 1941 to 29 January 1942. The long-standing dispute between Peru and Ecuador remained unresolved after the crisis in 1935. Another border clash, which threatened to escalate to war, occurred in June 1938. Ecuador appealed to several Latin American presidents in October for mediation. In December 1938, at the Eighth Conference of American States, several unofficial attempts were made to achieve a settlement: none was successful. During 1939-40 there were numerous border incidents. Relations between Ecuador and Peru deteriorated, and, toward the end of 1940, there were rumors of Peruvian troop movements in two directions toward Ecuadorian positions in the east and west. Ecuador increased the number of military posts and built roads for greater maneuverability. By December 1940 the danger of war was fully recognized by Ecuador. On 5 July 1941, according to Ecuador's foreign minister, Peruvian agricultural workers, accompanied by civil guards, entered Ecuador and opened fire on an Ecuadorian patrol, triggering a crisis for Ecuador. Fighting spread to several frontier posts and included Peruvian artillery and air attacks. Argentina, Brazil, and the United States proposed a joint effort by all American states to establish peace, but Chile refused to support it. Their plan for each side to withdraw its troops 15 kilometers from the recognized boundary was accepted by the adversaries, whose representatives arrived in Washington on 11 July for separate talks with Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles--to no effect.  On 23 July, as hostilities were renewed along a 50-kilometer front, Argentina, with U.S. support, renewed its appeal to cease hostilities. Two days later Peru's foreign minister indicated a willingness to accept a cease-fire. Ecuador began to mobilize on the 24th but agreed to a cease-fire on the 26th. Peru demanded that Ecuador annul the mobilization decree as a condition for accepting a cease-fire. After much deliberation Ecuador complied on 31 July. On 2 August the mediating powers (U.S., Argentina, Brazil) proposed a 15-kilometer withdrawal of all troops behind the status quo boundaries of 1936 and the placing of international observers. Ecuador accepted, but Peru did not reply. A cease-fire was implemented in the western zone; but in the Oriente, where there were no observers, Ecuador reported continued Peruvian advances. On 2 October military commanders of Ecuador and Peru agreed to the "Talara Truce" in which a neutral zone was established between the two lines in the provinces of Guayas, El Oro, and Loja. The situation in the Oriente was not affected. And on 4 October the mediators rejected a boundary line that Lima proposed on 13 September, which corresponded to the most advanced Peruvian posts.  The third Conference of Foreign Ministers of the American States began on 15 January 1942 in Rio de Janeiro, where informal negotiations were carried out by the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru. Under strong pressure from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S., they signed a boundary protocol on 29 January 1942 ending the fighting between them: the agreement allocated 70,000 square miles of the disputed territory to Peru, granted Ecuador navigation rights on the Amazon River, and called for demarcation of the border. The second Marañón crisis was over--but the border conflict continued.  The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.
Iran's crisis over the Anglo-Soviet invasion of its territory began on 25 August 1941 and ended on 29 January 1942. Iran's neutrality at the onset of World War II was opposed by the U.K. and the Soviet Union because of that country's rich oil reserves and their need for strategic bases and communication routes. They particularly objected to the large number of Germans in Iran and demanded their expulsion by August 1941. Iran refused to comply, maintaining its right to control its own internal affairs. The Anglo-Soviet invasion on 25 August 1941 triggered a crisis for Iran, which promptly ordered its army to resist the attack. When resistance collapsed within 48 hours, Reza Shah abdicated in favor of his son Muhammad Reza. A decision was reached on 28 August at an extraordinary session of Iran's cabinet to cease fire and to continue diplomatic negotiations already in progress. Soviet troops occupied the north of the country, while the British occupied the south, joined, in 1942, by U.S. troops. Negotiations with Britain and the Soviet Union continued throughout the year. While the British assumed a more flexible position, the Soviets proceeded to increase their demands upon Iran. During the course of the negotiations Iran sought direct U.S. intervention. While the U.S. refused to participate in the talks at that time, it was instrumental in bringing about a tripartite Treaty of Alliance signed on 29 January 1942. Under its terms, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR undertook to respect Iran's sovereignty and to withdraw from that country within six months after the cessation of hostilities with the Axis powers. This ended Iran's crisis.  The League of Nations had ceased to exist de facto at the time of this crisis.
The Japanese attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor crystallized a crisis for Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Thailand, Germany, and Italy. The duration of the crisis was from 26 November 1941 until 7 June 1942. Japan's quest for empire was symbolized by the proclamation of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It began with the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 (see Case #39--Mukden Incident, in China/Japan PC). During the 1930s the Imperial Army spread southward into China (see Cases #40--Shanghai, in 1932; #43--Jehol Campaign, in 1933; #56--Marco Polo Bridge, in 1937-38; all in China/Japan PC). Later its attention shifted to the Western colonial empires in Southeast Asia (British Malaya, Dutch Indonesia, French Indochina). These countries could supply Japan's need for raw materials so as to reduce its dependence on other countries, notably the U.S., for such strategic commodities as petroleum, rubber, and iron.  In 1941 both the U.S. and the U.K. stood in the way of complete Japanese control of the Far East and Southeast Asia. The U.S. had vested interests in the region since the early part of the century, and its army and navy occupied important bases around Manila Bay in the Philippines. The U.S. considered the Philippines a vital link in the defense line for the protection of the west coast and continental United States. The British had long controlled Malaya and Borneo, with Singapore serving as one of the most important U.K. bases for imperial defense.  The fall of France in 1940 (see Case #78--Fall of Western Europe) had removed one of Japan's obstacles; and by 1941 the Konoye government had worked out an arrangement with Vichy France for the use of French Indochina as a military corridor and base. The Dutch government and royal family fled to London with the fall of the Netherlands on 12 May 1940. However, its government-in-exile, together with the Dutch East Indies government (headed by the governor-general), continued to run the affairs of Indonesia, which was rich in oil and rubber.  During 1940 the United States exerted economic pressure on Japan. On 25 July the President prohibited the export of U.S. petroleum, petroleum products, and scrap metal without license. A few days later an embargo was imposed on the export of aviation fuel to all countries outside the Western Hemisphere except for use by U.S. planes. The embargo was expanded to scrap iron and steel after the signing of the Germany-Italy-Japan Tripartite Pact on 26 September 1940. After Japan landed troops in French Indochina on 24 July 1941, talks between Japan and the United States were broken off and all Japanese assets in the United States were frozen, effectively cutting Japan off from its most important markets and sources of raw materials.  In August Prime Minister Konoye sought a meeting with President Roosevelt but was rebuffed. Later that month, at a joint army-navy meeting, the heads of the Japanese armed forces agreed in principle that, if diplomacy did not bring results by mid-October 1941, the use of force against the U.S. would be unavoidable; and they subsequently stated that the decision for war or peace must be made by 15 October. Between 25 September and 15 October Konoye was unsuccessful in gaining political control over the supreme command of the armed forces. The cabinet resigned on 16 October, and Konoye was replaced, on the 18th, by General Tojo, who retained the position of War Minister.  To the United States' surprise, Tojo decided to continue the diplomatic path and sent a second envoy, Kurusu, to Washington to help the resident ambassador, Nomura, in his efforts to reach an agreement. Meanwhile, secret plans for the military campaign against the United States continued. During the first two weeks of November the Japanese embassy in Washington received a steady stream of messages that would eventually make up two Japanese proposals, A and B. These messages were deciphered by U.S. naval intelligence, thus informing the U.S. of a new Japanese deadline of 25 November for U.S. acceptance of its final proposal. (The deadline, the U.S. discovered, was postponed to 29 November.) Japan's proposals were rejected by Secretary of State Cordell Hull. On 26 November 1941 Hull presented the two Japanese envoys with a Ten Point Plan, viewed by Japan as an ultimatum and triggering a crisis for Tokyo. At the same time that Nomura and Kurusu were talking with Hull, Admiral Nagumo's task force had been at sea for 24 hours en route to Pearl Harbor. However, it was still in Tojo's power to stop them. On 1 December Japan's major response was a decision for war, but negotiations with the United States continued until 7 December.  The attack on Pearl Harbor, on 7 December 1941, triggered a crisis for the United States as well as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the U.K. The Americans suffered 2,400 deaths and over 1,000 wounded. The U.S. responded on 8 December with a declaration of war. The British responded to the attack on a friendly state, as well as to the attack on Malaya the same day, by declaring war on Japan. Canada did likewise on the 8th. The Netherlands' response, on 8 December, was to mobilize the army in the Netherlands East Indies and to declare a state of emergency.  The trigger to Thailand's crisis was a Japanese attack on its territory on 8 December. After only five hours of fighting, the Thai government surrendered and announced that it would allow Japanese forces to pass through its territory. Japan, it was contended, would respect Thailand's territorial integrity. On 8 December, too, when the United States and its allies declared war on Japan, a crisis was triggered for Italy and Germany. The following day Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis with similar declarations of war. On 10 December Thailand announced that it would not fight together with the Allied forces, thereby ending its crisis. And on 11 December Italy and Germany declared war on the United States. On the 21st a 10-year alliance was signed at Bangkok between Japan and Thailand: the Thai government agreed to aid Japan and declared war on the U.S. and the U.K. on 25 January 1942.  On 25 December 1941 British and Canadian forces in Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese. From 27 January to 1 March the Battle of the Java Sea took place: Allied naval units were largely destroyed, and the way was opened for the Japanese conquest of the East Indies. The end of the crisis for the Netherlands was its formal surrender on 5 March 1942. Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 when the Japanese, having penetrated Malaya, landed from the north. Sixty thousand prisoners were taken. The fall of Singapore, signaling apparent victory for Japan, terminated its crisis and the crisis for its Axis allies, Germany and Italy. The British surrender terminated the U.K. crisis, in defeat.  In March the British evacuated Rangoon, allowing Japan to occupy Burma; the Burma Road was subsequently closed. The Battle of the Coral Sea began on 7 May. Allied naval and air power frustrated a possible Japanese invasion of Australia by destroying 100,000 tons of Japanese shipping between New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. On 8 May, with the reduction of danger, the crisis ended for Australia and New Zealand. And on 4 June a Japanese naval force attacked Midway Island and was dispersed, with heavy losses, by U.S. air and naval units. The crisis for Canada and the United States ended on 7 June 1942.  The United States approached the Pan American Union on 10 December 1941, but no activity followed.
The USSR and Germany were enmeshed in a turning-point intrawar crisis (IWC) over Stalingrad from 28 June 1942 to 2 February 1943. The city of Stalingrad was one of the three strategic prizes of the German military campaign that began with "Operation Barbarossa" on 22 June 1941 (see Case #85), along with Moscow and Leningrad. The former Volgograd, renamed in honor of the ruler of the Soviet Union, was cut off from its hinterland, both in the north and the south, in July 1942. On 28 June 1942 German forces launched another major offensive in the east, triggering an IWC for the Soviet Union. At stake was the entire southern part of the eastern front, with the vast oil resources of the Caucasus at risk. On 28 July Stalin, by his Special Order 227, recognized that the city of Stalingrad, too, was a major objective of the German campaign. That military offensive appeared on the point of succeeding, but the Wehrmacht had overstretched its lines.  Seizing the opportunity created by the vulnerability of German forces, the Red Army launched a massive counteroffensive northwest and southeast of Stalingrad on 19 November, aimed at encircling the city and crushing the German Sixth Army. This triggered what was to become the gravest IWC for Germany during World War II--until the D-Day offensive in the West in 1944 (see Case #94).  The following day Hitler issued a personal order to the commander of the Sixth Army to stand fast no matter the cost. During the course of the Battle of Stalingrad this "no retreat" decision was repeated several times--after Field Marshal Manstein's request on 25 November to withdraw and General Zeitzler's similar appeal during December. The German operation to break out of its encirclement, "Winter Gale," began on 12 December but suffered defeat after defeat. Soviet forces recaptured Velikye-Luki on 1 January and entered Mozdok on the 3rd to relieve Leningrad from a 17-month siege. On 8 January 1943 the Soviets presented Hitler with an ultimatum to surrender at Stalingrad: it was refused.  On the 10th, the last phase of the Battle of Stalingrad began with an enormous Soviet artillery bombardment. Another Soviet demand for the surrender of German forces was made on the 24th, again refused by Hitler. On 31 January Soviet forces captured Field Marshal von Paulus, the commander of German forces at Stalingrad. Twenty-two German divisions were cut off and reduced to 80,000 men. They were forced to capitulate on 2 February 1943, ending Germany's Stalingrad crisis in disastrous defeat: the Germans and their Axis allies lost more than half a million soldiers, killed or captured. The Soviet IWC ended the same day in resounding triumph. The tide of battle in the "Great Patriotic War" was changed irrevocably, as Soviet armies began the long march through German-occupied eastern Europe, culminating in the occupation of Berlin in May 1945.
The North Africa campaign, beginning with the Battle of El Alamein, was an intrawar crisis for Germany and Italy from 23 October 1942 to 13 May 1943. In the summer of 1942 a number of military victories were achieved by the Axis powers in North Africa. The British had been considerably weakened by their dispatch of 60,000 troops to Greece and had been forced to abandon recent conquests in Libya. On 21 June German General Rommel, commanding eight Italian divisions along with the Afrika Corps, captured Tobruk, the key to British defenses in North Africa. By the end of the month Rommel had moved toward the British-held stronghold at El Alamein in Egypt. When fuel shortages became extreme, the Italians were forced to halt their advance. On 23 October 1942 the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Montgomery, attacked from its position at El Alamein and broke through the Axis lines, triggering a crisis for Germany and Italy. The battle, which turned the tide of the war in North Africa, lasted 16 days.  A major British attack on 1-2 November succeeded in breaking through the southern sector of the front and overrunning the Italian divisions in the area. Rommel contacted Hitler's headquarters and informed him of his intention to withdraw while opportunity still prevailed. On 3 November Hitler ordered Rommel to stand fast and use all men and weapons available to defend the Axis position; the Italian response was similar. Rommel adhered reluctantly to the order. By the time permission for withdrawal was given the following day it was too late to save anything but the motorized divisions of the Panzer Army.  On 8 November, an Anglo-American force, commanded by General Eisenhower, disembarked in French Morocco and Algiers in an amphibious operation hitherto unequaled in history. Within three days Vichy French resistance had collapsed. The British headed toward Tunisia. Tobruk was reoccupied on 12 November and Benghazi on the 20th--by British forces advancing from Egypt into Libya.  From 17 to 27 January Churchill, de Gaulle, and Roosevelt met in Casablanca. Eisenhower took command of the unified Allied North African operations. The British Eighth Army broke through the Mareth Line into southern Tunisia and met the advancing U.S. Second Army Corps on 8 April. The termination of the crisis for Germany and Italy was 13 May 1943 when all German and Italian troops in North Africa surrendered.
The Allied invasion of Italy triggered an intrawar crisis for Italy and Germany from 9 July to 11 September 1943. The Anglo-American campaign in North Africa resulted in a crushing defeat for Germany and Italy in May 1943 (see Case #90). United States, British, and Canadian forces launched an attack on Sicily on 9 July 1943, triggering a crisis for Italy: its mainland was threatened; and there was an imminent danger of the collapse of Mussolini's Fascist regime. Italy's leader perceived capitulation as a threat to Italy's role and status as a great power and felt that it would lead to prolonged occupation by the Allies.  Mussolini met with Hitler on 19 July in the hope of obtaining Hitler's consent to Italy's early withdrawal from the war; no concessions were granted. The Italian response, on 24 July, was the dismissal of Mussolini by the king, at a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, and the appointment of a new government under Marshal Pietro Badoglio. The council, which had not met since 12 September 1939, criticized Mussolini for leading the country into disaster. The majority of the party leaders were convinced of the advisability of a conclusion of a separate peace and a return to constitutional monarchy.  The news of Mussolini's dismissal, on 25 July, triggered a crisis for Germany. Armistice proposals by Italy, expected within a week to 10 days, would jeopardize German strategic control of northern Italy and expose the Reich's southern flank. The following day Hitler ordered German forces into northern Italy. On 18 August Italian resistance in Sicily collapsed following thousands of casualties on both sides. Allied troops landed on the boot of southern Italy on 2 September. The next day an armistice agreement was signed between Italy and the Western powers, ending hostilities between the Anglo-American forces and those of the Badoglio regime. German and Italian forces evacuated Sicily on 8 September, terminating Italy's crisis with the Allies. On the l0th Italian forces surrendered to the Germans after they were defeated in the battle around Rome. The crisis ended for Germany on 11 September when all Italian territory, including Rome, was declared by the German army to be a theater of war under German military control.  (Mussolini, who had been held prisoner near Rome, was rescued by German troops, and proclaimed the establishment of a Republican Fascist Party in northern Italy, in alliance with the German army of occupation.)
Hungary's intrawar crisis with Germany lasted from 13 to 19 March 1944. After Italy's capitulation to the Allies in September 1943 (see Case #91), Germany began to consider the possibility of a similar fate for Hungary and Romania, and plans were made for German occupation of both countries. While Romania was perceived to be a lesser problem, it was known that Hungary had begun to send out feelers for an armistice agreement with the Allies. German plans for the occupation of Hungary were operationalized on 12 March, as Soviet forces moved rapidly toward the Hungarian frontier. The concentration of German troops around Vienna and on the Hungarian frontier triggered a crisis for Hungary on 13 March 1944. Two days later, Hitler demanded that Hungary's Regent, Admiral Horthy, meet with him. While Horthy deliberated his decision, fearing his detention and arrest while Germany occupied Hungary, the Allies decided finally to seek an armistice with Hungary and therefore dropped a U.S. mission into that country on 17 March to discuss terms of surrender. By 18 March Horthy had decided that he was compelled to see Hitler at any cost, and set out to do so.  Horthy was detained for one day, under the pretext of an air raid, and allowed to reach the Hungarian frontier as German troops began their invasion. On 19 March Hungary was occupied by Germany with no real resistance. The U.S. mission was turned over to the German forces, and Hungary's capitulation ended its crisis.
Soviet offensives into Eastern Europe in 1944-45 created an intrawar crisis for Romania, Germany, and Hungary from 26 March 1944 to 13 February 1945. Romanian oil fields had been protected by Germany since 1939. And on 23 September 1940 Romania became a member of the Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan), fighting alongside Germany against the Soviet Union. As the tide turned at the Battle of Stalingrad (see Case #89), Soviet troops began major offensives into Eastern Europe. In December 1943 the U.S. and the USSR, followed by the U.K., warned Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary that Germany's defeat would mean a defeat for those countries as well. Romania's King Michael began to try to find ways to arrange an agreement with the Allies. By the end of March Soviet troops were marching toward Romania's borders.  Hungarian peace feelers throughout 1943 provoked German suspicions, resulting in its occupation by Germany on 19 March 1944, at the time that Hungarian Regent Horthy was meeting with Hitler. The economic situation in Hungary was severe from 1943, along with increased repression, as a result of the German occupation. A crisis for Romania was triggered on 26 March with the arrival of Soviet forces at its border, threatening defeat and occupation. A USSR announcement on 2 April declared that the Soviet Union did not wish to take over Romanian territory; nor did it aspire to create a new social order there. Soviet troops would enter the country only as needed to continue the resistance to enemy forces.  On the 4th the Allies began mass bombings of Romania, especially oil production installations. One week later Soviet armistice terms were rejected by Romania. By 5 May oil production was down to half of its previous level.  Romania's major response, on 23 August, was King Michael's acceptance of armistice terms proferred covertly by the Soviet Union. An amnesty was declared for political prisoners, and a Government of National Union was set up: Romania would henceforth fight alongside the Allies. The Romanian response triggered a crisis for Germany, with the loss of an ally, and the threat of the Soviet thrust extending to Germany itself. The German response, the same day, was an order to seize the Romanian oil fields and the nearby harbor of Constanta, and to set up a pro-German government in Romania. On the 25th Germany bombed Bucharest while negotiations between the Soviets and the Romanians continued. On 12 September an armistice was signed in Moscow, ending the crisis for Romania.  Within a week Soviet forces approached the borders of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. And on 22 September they expelled the Germans from Romania, ending Germany's crisis over Romania in defeat.  A crisis for Hungary was triggered on 22 September with an invasion by Soviet and Romanian forces. Hungary attempted to contact the Allies that day, and again on 10 October, when a provisional armistice was arranged in Moscow conditional on Hungary's joining the war against Germany. Hungary responded on 15 October with Horthy's proclamation of an armistice. Some Hungarian troops, however, joined the German forces. Hungary's response triggered another crisis for Germany, which responded on the 16th by placing Horthy under protective custody; and, as the Hungarians surrendered, German forces took over Budapest. Horthy finally signed the appointment of Szalasi, head of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross movement, as Prime Minister.  By December 1944 the Red Army had begun a siege of Budapest, completely encircling the city by the 26th. The battle lasted two more months, and on 13 February 1945 Budapest fell, terminating the crisis for both Germany and Hungary in defeat, with the latter effectively out of the war.  Bulgaria held a series of negotiations with the Soviet Union and eventually withdrew from the Axis and entered the war against Germany.
An intrawar crisis for Germany was triggered by the Allied landing in Western Europe on 6 June 1944. It lasted until Germany's surrender on 7 May 1945. By 1944 the tide of war had definitely turned in the Allies' favor. The end of Axis resistance in North Africa had been achieved by 13 May 1943 (see Case #90--El Alamein). The Soviets had defeated the Germans at Stalingrad and at Kursk-Orel and were advancing rapidly through Eastern Europe (see Cases #89 and #93). German divisions in southern Italy had been forced to retreat (see Case #91). And the war in the Pacific was proceeding successfully for the U.S. (see Case #95). For many months careful and elaborate plans for the invasion of France had been made by the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, commanded by General Eisenhower. The chief base for the concentration of troops and war materials was the U.K.; and the plan of the campaign had been rehearsed and prepared to the finest detail. An IWC was triggered for Germany on 6 June 1944 when British, American and Canadian forces invaded Nazi-occupied Western Europe. The German response was immediate: wherever they encountered Allied troops they fought back, hoping to prevent a firm Allied foothold on the Normandy coast. Within one week, however, a strip of beach 60 miles long had been occupied and artificial harbors were constructed--to offset the lack of port facilities for disembarkation. With the capture of Cherbourg on 27 June the Allies gained a major port. Throughout the summer they advanced into France and Belgium, and, on 2 September 1944, the U.S. First Army crossed the German frontier. The advance was halted when an Allied attempt to outflank the West Wall through the flat Dutch territory in the north failed, and survivors of an Allied airborne division, which had been dropped in Holland at Arnhem, had to be withdrawn. On 16 December the Germans broke through U.S. defense lines in the Belgian and Luxembourg sector. The Battle of the Bulge inflicted heavy losses, and the Allied forces were driven back to the Meuse. The gap was closed by the end of December when the Allies rallied to attack on both sides of the "Bulge."  From the beginning of 1945 the Allied drive into Germany from the west coordinated with the rapid and powerful Soviet offensive from the east (see Case #100). President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Marshal Stalin met at Yalta in the Crimea on 7 February to plan the final defeat and occupation of Germany. The U.S. First and Third Armies crossed into Germany in February and March, and the British and Canadians opened an offensive southeast of Nijmegen, Holland. By 12 April the U.S. Ninth Army had reached the Elbe River. On that day President Roosevelt died. Soviet forces fought their way into Berlin on the 25th. And on the 26th the armies of the U.S. and USSR met on the Elbe at Torgau. On 29 April German resistance in northern Italy broke. And on 1 May the Battle of Berlin began. A German radio announcement from Hamburg declared that Hitler had died that day. On 7 May a group of German army leaders sent envoys to Reims where they signed terms of surrender, ending the crisis for Germany and the war in Europe.
The defeat at Saipan precipitated an IWC for Japan between 9 and 18 July 1944. The war in the Pacific had been turning against Japan since the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Toward the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1944 Japanese sea lanes came under continuous attack from the American and British navies. Although the Japanese leadership understood the gravity of the situation, the Japanese press continued to inform the public of the war's progress--in Japan's favor. In February 1944 the largest carrier-launched air armada in history attacked Japan's strategic Caroline Islands base at Truk, sinking 19-26 ships and destroying about 200 planes. Prime Minister Tojo carried out a major reorganization and consolidation of his cabinet on 19 February. He assumed the post of Chief of the Army General Staff and appointed Navy Minister Shimada as Chief of the Navy General Staff. For the first time in Japanese history administrative and command posts were held by the same persons.  Severe restrictions were placed on Japanese society. There was mobilization and reorganization of labor and business. Air raid defense networks were built, and entertainment centers were closed. As the pressure of the Allied forces grew, so did the opposition to Tojo within the Japanese elite. In June American forces delivered a series of devastating attacks upon Saipan, Tinian, Guam, and Rota in the Marianas. The strategic cordon of defense that Japan had created around the home islands vanished rapidly. The American invasion of Saipan, "Operation Forager," began with a bombardment of Japanese positions on 13 June 1944. The island's strategic importance was due to the fact that long-range American bombers, if installed on airstrips there, could threaten the Japanese people in their cities and towns. The defeat at Saipan on 9 July 1944 triggered another intrawar crisis for Japan, which perceived a threat of grave damage to its population centers. On the 13th Prime Minister Tojo sought advice from the Lord Privy Seal, the Marquis Kido, who had been Tojo's supporter for the position of Prime Minister. Kido presented the prime minister with three conditions aimed at changing the nature and style of his government. He demanded the separation of the war minister and army chief of staff posts, the replacement of the navy minister, and the formation of a United Front cabinet which would include members of the senior statesmen-group (Jushin), consisting of former prime ministers.  During the next four days Tojo attempted to reorganize his cabinet. Most ex-prime ministers refused to join and demanded Tojo's resignation. On 18 July Tojo resigned terminating this crisis for Japan.
A crisis for Iran over Soviet demands for oil concessions took place from 26 September to 9 December 1944. Contrary to the tripartite treaty of 1942, the USSR showed signs of continuing its occupation in order to keep northern Iran and its oil resources within the sphere of Soviet influence. At that time there were only two authorized oil concessionaires in Iran: the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in the southwest; and the Kavir-i-Khurian Company near Seronan, owned jointly by the Soviet Union and an Iranian group. The publication in August 1944 of a general Anglo-American agreement for oil concessions in the southeast aroused criticism by the communist-dominated Tudeh Party in a Majlis debate and disturbed the Soviets to the extent that they decided to revive their claims to oil concessions in northern Iran. A crisis for Iran was triggered on 26 September 1944 when the Soviet Assistant People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Kavtaradre, during a visit to Teheran, demanded oil concessions in five northern Iranian provinces. The Soviet demand was viewed by nationalist elements in Iran's government as being detrimental to Iran's national interests, as well as an infringement upon Iran's sovereignty. Iran's response was a decision to reject all (British, U.S., and Soviet) demands for oil concessions. Whereas Britain and the United States accepted the Iranian decision, the USSR rejected it and questioned the integrity of Iran's Prime Minister Sa'id. This was followed by a violent press campaign by the Tudeh Party attacking Sa'id's policies and demanding his resignation. The campaign led to mass demonstrations in Teheran and other cities against Sa'id. In Teheran, Soviet army trucks carried considerable numbers of Tudeh Party members to a demonstration in front of the Majlis, while Soviet army detachments with tanks protected the demonstrators against any counteraction by Iranian troops. The presence of Soviet troops paralyzed any activity on the part of the Iranians. Sa'id resigned on 8 November and a new government was formed by Mortera Quli Bayat. This new government was also attacked by the Tudeh Party in demonstrations and through the press. On 2 December the Majlis passed a law forbidding any minister to grant or negotiate oil concessions with foreign governments without parliamentary approval. The crisis ended when Kavtaradre and his delegation left Iran for Moscow on 9 December 1944.  Iran, which had looked toward the U.S. as a friendly third power, was disappointed that Washington did not openly oppose Soviet claims.  The League of Nations did not function in 1944.
The U.S. invasion of Leyte in the Philippines created another IWC for Japan from 20 October to 26 December 1944. The Japanese anticipated an early U.S. attempt to retake the Philippines; and in the summer of 1944 they began developing defense plans that included air and navy support. By September 1944 Japan had suffered serious reverses on both military and diplomatic fronts. On 20 October 1944 the advance units of the largest amphibious operation of the Pacific war (four U.S. divisions, ultimately involving a quarter of a million troops) landed on the island of Leyte. This began the campaign for the reconquest of the Philippines, triggering a crisis for Japan: Tokyo perceived a strategic threat to the home islands if the Philippines fell to the Americans. In the last major naval battle of World War II, the Japanese navy suffered a loss of 40 ships sunk, 46 ships damaged, and 405 planes destroyed. On land the scope of the campaign is evident in the casualties on Leyte: more than 15,000 Americans and more than 50,000 Japanese. The Philippines had been earmarked by Japan as the first in a series of decisive battles that was slated to end in Japan's overwhelming triumph. When the army agreed to concentrate its forces in a bold effort to rout the Americans, Prime Minister Koiso and the Japanese people were led to believe that a Japanese victory in Leyte would turn the tide of the war. Japan's response, on 24 October, was to withdraw its fleet from Philippine waters once they had failed to halt the Leyte invasion.  After the defeat Japan no longer had a fleet or air force that could mount an offensive. Japan was losing planes and pilots faster than they could be replaced. On 24 November the first large-scale B-29 raid on Japan began. This destroyed major Japanese aircraft factories. On 26 December the U.S. announced the successful completion of the Leyte campaign, granting control of the Pacific to the Allies, and ending Japan's IWC in total defeat.
A crisis for the U.K. over Greece lasted from 3 December 1944 to 15 January 1945. After the withdrawal of the German occupation forces from Greece in October 1944, there was an intense struggle for power among Greece's political factions. The British, who were determined to impose a settlement that would ensure stability and their strong presence in the country, were in direct opposition to Greece's Communists. The Caserta Agreement, signed on 20 September 1944, called for all guerrilla forces in the country to be placed under Greek government command, headed by British General Scobie. The crisis trigger for the U.K. was an exchange of fire between Greek Communist demonstrators and the police on 3 December 1944. This touched off a violent civil war that was perceived by Britain as a threat to its influence in the international system. More specifically, a communist takeover in Greece would virtually end all British influence in the region. Prime Minister Churchill responded the next day by ordering General Scobie to intervene with his forces and to open fire if necessary. Churchill flew to Athens on 24 December in an effort to bring the various factions together and settle the crisis. In the course of serious clashes, British and Greek troops succeeded in driving the Greek Communists out of Athens.  The U.K.'s crisis ended on 15 January 1945 with the implementation of a truce agreement. The United States was not active in this crisis, though Churchill and Roosevelt corresponded regularly. State Department criticism of British intervention was viewed unfavorably by Churchill. On the other hand, USSR inactivity was viewed favorably because it meant that Stalin was living up to the terms of the "spheres of influence" agreement struck at an earlier meeting in Moscow. The civil war in Greece erupted into another crisis for Britain in 1946 (see Case #112--Greek Civil War II, in 1946-47, in Multiregional PCs: East/West).  The League of Nations was moribund by 1944-45.
Following the American victory at Leyte, the U.S. invasion of Luzon created another IWC for Japan from 9 January to 3 March 1945. After the defeat at Leyte, Japan's political and military leaders concentrated their hopes for victory on Luzon. As the situation deteriorated in the Philippines, the emperor called a meeting of the Jushin (senior statesmen) on 6 January 1945 to seek their advice on the future course. While the Japanese military had already lost the war, some of the Jushin advised, Japan's spirit could not be destroyed. For want of a better solution, they now proposed a concentration of forces against the U.S. in the hope that a victorious battle would permit Japan to end the war on more favorable terms. On 9 January two corps of the U.S. Sixth Army invaded Luzon, triggering a new crisis for Japan. They had gained an element of surprise by selecting an undesirable part of the coastline for landing. A combination of artillery, air bombardment, and the dogged advance of the U.S. infantry gradually led to progress. Although the Japanese forces were cut off from retreat in Manila, they continued to refuse to surrender. Other U.S. forces sought to secure Manila Bay. Finally, on 3 March, the American occupation of Manila was completed, terminating this crisis for Japan.
An intrawar crisis for Germany in the East lasted from the beginning of the final Soviet offensive on 11 January until Germany's surrender on 7 May 1945. This crisis overlapped with the German IWC over the continuing Allied advance in Western Europe in 1944-45 (see Case #94--D-Day). Both ended with Germany's capitulation. The campaign was planned by the Soviets as a separate and well-defined offensive. The aim was to strike at the heart of the Third Reich. The Russian homeland had been liberated from Nazi conquest by July 1944; and by 29 August Soviet forces had reached the border of East Prussia. At this point they halted and deliberately did not penetrate German territory. Instead, they concentrated on the Baltic Peninsula and the Balkans. These areas were liberated in October and December of 1944. In January 1945 the Soviets turned their full attention to the planning of a two-pronged attack, against East Prussia in the north and Silesia in the center. An intrawar crisis for Germany was triggered on 11 January 1945 when the first part of the Soviet offensive began with a thrust from Poland into Silesia. For the first time Germany proper was threatened. The German response was immediate: they used every means available in order to halt the Soviet advance. On 13 January the second Soviet thrust advanced from Lithuania into East Prussia. By 1 February East Prussia had been conquered, and the Soviets advanced into Silesia capturing a long and broad front inside the eastern border of Germany along the Oder River from Zehden in the north to Ratibor in the south. By the end of March they held the entire area of eastern Germany. On 25 April 1945 the Soviets entered Berlin.  Meanwhile the Allies were advancing in western Germany, and the two armies met on the 25th. Thereafter, both armies converged on those parts of Germany that had not yet been conquered until the Third Reich finally collapsed and surrendered on 7 May 1945 to the Allied and Soviet Commands.
The Battle of Iwo Jima generated an intrawar crisis for Japan from 19 February to 16 March 1945. Iwo Jima, located among a group of volcanic islands midway between the Marianas and Japan, was of high strategic salience to the armies of both adversaries. Japan used it as a staging base for damaging raids on U.S. B-29s in the Marianas; and the U.S. found it imperative to capture the island, destroy the air base, and establish a position 750 miles from Yokahama. Iwo Jima received the longest and most intensive U.S. preinvasion bombardment of any objective in the Pacific war. Regular air raids had begun in August 1944; and soon thereafter they were a daily occurrence. Nevertheless, Japanese defenses were not destroyed. After the Fall of Saipan (see Case #95), the Japanese resolved to convert Iwo Jima into an impregnable fortress. As the bombs fell, they dug deeper underground. An IWC for Japan was triggered on 19 February 1945 when the U.S. launched a massive invasion of Iwo Jima. Firing from concealed points, the Japanese resisted the U.S. advance yard by yard in a stubborn and protracted battle that cost the U.S. 19,938 casualties, including 4,198 dead. On 8 March the Japanese began one of their most concerted counterattacks. It caught the U.S. marines off guard. They, in turn, rallied for a great flanking movement that pressed the Japanese back toward the sea. Japanese losses were very high.  The last phase of the battle began on 11 March with a more rapid U.S. advance. On 16 March one of the last segments of opposition was pushed into a small region on the northern end of the island where the Japanese fought defiantly until the end. Other pockets were eliminated, with difficulty. The crisis for Japan ended in defeat on the 16th.  The following day the Americans raised the U.S. flag on the island of Iwo Jima.
A crisis between the Soviet Union and Romania lasted from 24 February to 6 March 1945. The Soviet August 1944 offensive against Germany prompted a palace revolt in Bucharest on 23 August 1944, and Romania became part of the Allied war effort against Germany (see Case #93--Soviet Occupation of East Europe, in Multiregional PCs: World War II). Predominant Soviet influence in Romania was recognized by the Allies in September 1944. Following the palace coup there was a succession of governments. Radescu was appointed Prime Minister in December 1944. The domestic political situation during his tenure was very fluid, and the country became increasingly paralyzed between Right and Left. Disturbances occurred in factories, with communist attempts to take over workshop committees. In February 1945 unrest steadily mounted, with violent criticisms in the Soviet media. The Romanian press was suppressed. A Soviet crisis was triggered on 24 February 1945 when rioting erupted in Bucharest. That evening Premier Radescu broadcast a call to resist all foreign attempts at intervention in Romania's affairs. The USSR response was the dispatch of Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to Bucharest on 27 February. Moscow demanded that Radescu be replaced immediately on the grounds that he was incapable of maintaining order. When King Michael refused to consider this, Vyshinsky issued an ultimatum to appoint the "democratic choice" as Premier, Petru Groza, the Soviet candidate for the position. He also informed the king that his refusal would be interpreted as a hostile act against the Soviet Union. Simultaneous with Vyshinsky's ultimatum, the Soviet Command in Bucharest moved Romanian troops from the capital to the front, eliminating the king's chances of resistance while one million Soviet troops remained within striking distance of the capital. This ultimatum, on 28 February, triggered a crisis for Romania. Soviet demands were complied with on 1 March. The termination date for both crisis actors was 6 March 1945, when Groza was installed as Prime Minister after the king had overcome domestic opposition.  The League of Nations was not functioning in 1945.
Japan's IWC over the island of Okinawa took place from 1 April to 21 June 1945. By the spring of 1945 both time and space for Japan had run out. U.S. victories in the Philippines and Iwo Jima had chiseled away the outer walls of Japan's outposts of defense; and the route to final victory was controlled by Allied air and naval power. On 21 March a U.S. aircraft carrier, penetrating Japanese inland waters, attacked principal units of the Japanese Home Fleet, damaging 15 warships and destroying 475 planes. Japanese suicide attacks had become a calculated tactic as the U.S. proceeded to plan for the occupation of Okinawa, 325 miles from Japanese cities. On 1 April 1945 U.S. marines and army troops invaded Okinawa and triggered another intrawar crisis for Japan. A Japanese attempt to check this amphibious operation resulted in the sinking by U.S. aircraft of the Japanese battleship Yamato, two cruisers, and three destroyers. On 5 April the Koiso cabinet collapsed in Tokyo. That day, as well, the Soviets announced that they would not renew their Neutrality Pact with Japan. One of the most extensive suicide assaults of modern warfare was launched by Japan on 6 April. A five-hour battle ensued in which 135 kamikaze pilots sank six vessels and damaged 18 others. Heavy fighting in April brought the adversaries to a stalemate. Toward the end of the month a Japanese counterattack was launched. The U.S. advances were slowed down both by strong resistance and heavy rains. On 9 June the new Prime Minister, Suzuki, announced that Japan would continue to defend itself to the end and that unconditional surrender was out of the question. Official resistance on Okinawa ended on 21 June 1945. The Okinawa campaign was the climax of Japan's final resistance; it left little room for doubt as to the outcome of the Pacific war.
The first international crisis over Trieste took place from 1 May to 11 June 1945. The U.K., the U.S., and Yugoslavia were the crisis actors. The city of Trieste (and the "Julian region" of which it was the centerpiece) was contested by rival powers throughout history because of its commercial and geopolitical importance: it was the principal outlet to the Adriatic for central Europe. Trieste had long performed this valuable function for the Hapsburg empire, until its demise in 1918.  In the prevalent mood of intense nationalism accompanying its unification, Italy claimed Trieste as terra irredenta (unredeemed land) as soon as Venice and Rome had been incorporated into the Italian state in 1866 and 1870. It has been unremitting in this claim ever since. So too was the new Yugoslavia from the time it was formed in 1918.  Italy's claim was at the heart of the issue of its participation in World War I. Thus in the (secret) Treaty of London (26 April 1915) France, the U.K., and Russia agreed to give Italy the Julian region, including Trieste, along with Trentino (South Tyrol to Austria) and the Dalmatian coast as territorial compensation for its entry into the war on the side of the Triple Entente. Italian forces occupied Trieste on 3 November 1918 amid the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire.  Dissatisfied by President Wilson's attempt at compromise at the Versailles Conference, Italy achieved its goal in November 1920: the Treaty of Rapallo gave Italy the Julian region. The cost, in terms of relations with the new Yugoslavia, which claimed Trieste with the same tenacity, was high-- permanent tension and periodic crises during the inter-world war period. Then, in 1941, the U.K.'s Foreign Minister, Anthony Eden, promised Yugoslavia "favorable consideration" of its claim for territorial revision regarding the Julian region after the war--in return for Yugoslavia's support during the war: it was perceived in Belgrade--and Rome--as an implied reversal of the 1915 Treaty of London concession to Italy's territorial claim. And it sowed the seeds of subsequent conflict. That conflict emerged in the closing weeks of World War II.  With the crumbling of German resistance in 1945 military cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western allies began to be eroded by political and ideological disputes related to the postwar settlement: the fundamental differences in their economic systems, political regimes, and ideological beliefs and their historically competing interests led to cracks in the Grand Alliance. It gave way to intense competition and potential conflict over spheres of influence in war-ravaged Europe.  Prime Minister Churchill urged the U.S. to seize as much territory in Europe as possible. Trieste was the first to reflect the emerging clash of interests between East and West. As German troops retreated from Italy, Anglo-American forces reached the northeast--to find that Tito had preceded them with his Yugoslav Partisans. On 1 May 1945 a crisis was perceived by the U.K. when Churchill received a cable from the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean reporting the presence of Tito's forces in Trieste. The following day the news reached the U.S. and triggered a crisis. That day, too, the Anglo-Americans occupied Trieste triggering a crisis for Yugoslavia.  Tension in the Trieste area mounted during the next week as the Yugoslavs began setting up a local administration and carrying out political purges while restricting the movements of Anglo-American forces. On 11 May President Truman cabled Churchill suggesting that Tito be informed, through their respective ambassadors in Belgrade, that the Yugoslav Government must immediately agree to the control of its forces by the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill agreed, and a directive was issued to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yugoslavia rejected the Allied demands on 17 May. The U.S. and U.K. response, on 21 May, was taken in conjunction with earlier inquiries by Truman to the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding possible military measures should Tito refuse to yield. Field Marshal Alexander's troops, reinforced by American units, crossed into the Yugoslav-occupied zone of Trieste. Later that day Yugoslavia announced its willingness to negotiate: the Anglo-American forces were far too strong for Yugoslavia to consider military resistance, especially as the USSR remained aloof from the crisis.  Talks were held at Devon at the end of May between General Morgan of the Allies and Yugoslav army representatives, and later in Belgrade among representatives of the three governments. The crisis ended without violence, when Yugoslavia withdrew its troops on 11 June 1945, two days after it yielded to U.K.-U.S. demands.  The city was demilitarized and divided into two zones, one controlled by an Allied (U.K.-U.S.) military government, the other by Yugoslavia. In a Memorandum of Understanding among Italy, the U.K., and the U.S., Rome was given a larger share in the administration of the Allied-controlled zone.  Italy was an involved actor, with basic interests in the outcome. The crisis served to intensify the conflict over Trieste, for Yugoslavia was an aggrieved party and later became involved in a series of tense situations that eventually escalated to a renewed crisis in 1953 (see Case #142).  The League of Nations had virtually ceased to exist since the beginning of World War II.
Syria and France were the actors in a crisis involving French control over Syria, from 17 May to 3 June 1945. Syria's independence was formally recognized by France and the U.K. in 1941. France, however, remained the Mandatory Power until the end of World War II and allowed Syria to maintain a militia, but not an army. The Comité Français de Liberation Nationale (CFLN), under the leadership of General Charles de Gaulle, had been recognized by the U.K. and the U.S. as the French government-in-exile. On 25 August 1944 de Gaulle entered Paris and the CFLN was then recognized as the Provisional Government of the French Republic, with Charles de Gaulle as President.  With the defeat of Nazi Germany in May 1945, the president and National Assembly of Syria appealed to France for a new treaty that would curtail French privileges in Syria and transfer control over security and foreign affairs from the French Mandatory Power to the government of Syria. France wished to delay this step until the formal establishment of the United Nations. Sporadic riots and strikes against the French in Syria began on 8 May. In order to retain control, and as a security measure, de Gaulle ordered French troops into Syria. A crisis for Syria was triggered on 17 May 1945 when three French battalions landed in Beirut and proceeded to Syria in order to secure positions in Damascus and other major cities. On 28 May the Syrian militia, accompanied by rioting citizens, attacked all French posts in the country. De Gaulle accused the British of supplying arms to the Syrians. The riots triggered a crisis for France, which responded the same day by firing on the militia and bombing major Syrian cities. In two days of fighting an estimated 400 soldiers and civilians lay dead in Damascus, along with countless injured.  After the outbreak of violence the U.K. intervened and demanded that France agree to a cease-fire, evacuate its positions in the Syrian cities, and return all French forces to their barracks. Churchill intimated to de Gaulle that, if the French did not comply, the consequences might be collisions between British and French forces. A disagreement between France and the U.K. over the authority of British General Paget, the Commander in Chief of all Allied forces in the Middle East, had precipitated the U.K. ultimatum. Churchill regarded the French forces as still officially under the supreme command of General Paget until the end of the Pacific war, while de Gaulle assumed that Paget had completed his function once the war in Europe was over.  De Gaulle considered rejecting the British ultimatum, even in light of the possibility of hostilities between French and British forces; but the French parliament and press vehemently opposed French resistance. On 3 June France complied with the ultimatum and evacuated its positions ending the crisis for both itself and Syria.  On 1 June the USSR sent a memorandum to de Gaulle expressing concern about developments in the Middle East. The U.S. was approached by de Gaulle on the 2nd to participate in a conference to settle the crisis in Syria, as well as all other Mandate questions in the Middle East, including Palestine and Iraq. Washington, however, refused to involve itself in an issue that it considered to be exclusively of British and French concern. Moreover, the idea of inviting the USSR to the conference prompted President Truman to reject the idea. British troops replaced the French until 1946 when the United Nations terminated the French Mandate and acknowledged the Syrian Republic's full sovereignty.
The Kars-Ardahan crisis, the first in the East/West Cold War, lasted from 7 June 1945 to 5 April 1946. Turkey alone was a crisis actor, while the U.S., the USSR, and the U.K. were highly involved. The territories of Kars and Ardahan are located in northeast Turkey bordering Armenia. Following its defeat in the Russo/Turkish War, the Ottoman Empire transferred Kars and Ardahan to Russia in 1878. They reverted to Republican Turkey in March 1921. At the end of World War II long-standing Soviet designs on the Turkish Straits were revived when the USSR requested a revision of its 1925 alliance with Turkey--due to changed conditions. A Soviet press campaign was launched against Turkey. On 7 June 1945, at a meeting in Moscow with the Turkish ambassador, Foreign Minister Molotov submitted a set of Soviet proposals to revise the 1936 Montreux Convention on the Straits. The demands, including the return of the Kars and Ardahan territories, triggered a crisis for Turkey. Its ambassador informed the Turkish government, which apprised the U.K. on 12 June. In Washington the U.K. ambassador proposed a joint U.S.-U.K. démarche, to be presented before the scheduled July Potsdam Conference; this was rejected by the U.S. at that time. Later in June and in early July information about the massing of Soviet forces on the Turkish frontier was relayed to Washington. The USSR, in exchanges with the U.S., presented its territorial demands for parts of Turkish Armenia, emphasizing the need for adequate security on the Black Sea coast, with free passage for Soviet warships and the right to close the Straits to all ships should it so desire. On 2 July Turkey responded by requesting aid from the U.K. and the U.S., emphasizing the dangerous situation in which the U.S. was being placed. This succeeded in getting Washington's agreement to bring the matter before Stalin at Potsdam.  When Churchill refused to consider Stalin's demands for bases in Turkey, Truman proposed a revision of the Montreux Convention under a three-power guarantee, to ensure free passage through the Straits for the ships of all states in peace and war. Discussion was postponed. As U.S. concern about Soviet ambitions increased, Washington decided on an unusual show of force. On 5 April 1946 the U.S. navy announced that the body of the deceased Turkish ambassador to the U.S. would be returned to Istanbul via the battleship Missouri, with full escort. This move, pointing to assured U.S. support, terminated the crisis for Turkey.  The situation remained stable throughout the summer until a renewal of Soviet demands triggered another, closely related crisis for Turkey in August 1946 (see Case #111--Turkish Straits).  Although the League of Nations formally continued to exist until April 1946, it was not involved in this crisis. The disputants discussed the idea of submitting this issue to the UN; but in the end the new global organization was not approached.
Japan's final intrawar crisis began with the dropping of the first U.S. atom bomb on 6 August 1945 and terminated with its formal surrender on 2 September 1945. Prime Minister Koiso, who had succeeded Tojo in July 1944, resigned on 8 April 1945. He was replaced by Admiral Suzuki, whose mission was to bring the war to an end, though the Japanese government and people were still committed publicly to continued resistance.  After the collapse of Germany in May (see Cases #94--D-Day and #100--Final Soviet Offensive), the Japanese were left without allies, and British and U.S. efforts concentrated on the Pacific theater. U.S. aircraft destroyed or immobilized the remnants of the Japanese navy and shattered Japan's industry. United States battleships shelled densely populated cities, and the air force dropped 40,000 tons of bombs on Japanese industrial centers in one month. Japanese morale began to disintegrate. On 20 June the emperor summoned the Supreme War Council and indicated his wish to seek peace with the Allies and to approach the Soviet Union with a request for mediation.  The Potsdam Conference began on 17 July 1945 with Churchill, Stalin, and Truman participating. The final text of their communiqué, dated 26 July, called for Japan's "unconditional surrender," while avoiding all mention of the future of the emperor, implying that the Allies would determine whether he would remain after the surrender. Japanese military forces would be disarmed, and Japan would be deprived of its imperial conquests. The Potsdam Declaration specified that Japan would be welcomed back into the international community and that the occupation would end after the Allies had accomplished their objectives and the Japanese had chosen a responsible government by democratic means. "The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction." Japan's prime minister, foreign minister, and navy minister were in favor of accepting the terms, but the war minister and the chief of staff were opposed. A grave intrawar crisis for Japan was triggered on 6 August when an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Three-fifths of the city was destroyed. Japan's crisis was compounded on the 8th when the Soviet Union declared war and launched a major invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria. A continuing threat to Japan's existence as a state was manifested on the 9th, with the dropping of another nuclear bomb on Nagasaki. The same day the inner cabinet in Tokyo appealed to the emperor for a final expression of his wish. The emperor opted for peace. On the l0th Japan made an offer of surrender on the basis of the Potsdam Declaration, but on condition that it did not comprise "any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler."  The U.S. government refused to accept any such condition and replied with the formula: "from the moment of surrender, the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ... " After lengthy consideration Japan, once again following the lead of the emperor, decided to surrender despite the rejection of a condition that had been considered essential. On 15 August the emperor told the Japanese nation that the war was at an end. The Suzuki cabinet resigned, and the formal terms of surrender were signed on 2 September aboard the U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Bay, ending the war and the final intrawar crisis for Japan.  The Japanese home islands were placed under the rule of a U.S. army of occupation. The emperor remained as head of state. And the Japanese political and police officials continued to function. The capitulation of Japanese forces in China took place on 9 September. And China regained sovereignty over Inner Mongolia and Manchuria, as well as the islands of Formosa and Hainan. Hong Kong was reoccupied by the British, who accepted the formal Japanese surrender at Singapore on 12 September 1945.  (A debate has raged for 50 years over the U.S. decision to employ atomic bombs in the closing days of World War II. Some, notably those who made the decision [President Truman and the U.S. defense establishment, and their defenders], argued that it was necessary in order to save half a million Americans or more who would have been killed in a frontal invasion of Japan's home islands. Others, led by revisionist historians of the origins of the Cold War, have argued that Japan would have surrendered before the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki--and that the most senior U.S. decision makers knew this at the time.)
There were four direct participants in the first major post-World War II international crisis--Iran, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR. The Azerbaijan crisis lasted from 23 August 1945 to 9 May 1946. Another crisis for Iran vis-à-vis the USSR erupted on 23 August 1945 when the Tudeh Party attempted to take over the city of Tabriz, the Azerbaijani capital and the headquarters of Soviet occupation forces. Supported and protected by Soviet troops, the Tudeh occupied several government buildings and issued a manifesto demanding administrative and cultural autonomy for Azerbaijan. The following day the Iranian government sent a gendarme force to reassert central authority over the insurgents. The gendarmes, however, were denied entry to the Soviet zone of occupation. Tension eased toward the end of September when the Tudeh Party withdrew from government buildings, the Iranian governor regained his authority, and communications with Teheran were restored.  Iran's crisis escalated on 16 November 1945 with a Soviet-supported rebellion by Iran's Democratic Party for the autonomy of Azerbaijan. The Iranian government responded by sending an armed force to Tabriz on the 17th; they were, however, stopped near Qasvin by a Soviet military force.  The 16 November rebellion also triggered a crisis for the U.K., which perceived a threat to its influence in the Middle East. Britain delivered a Note to the Soviet Union on the 26th asking it to withdraw its troops from Iran by 2 March 1946. A similar Note had been sent two days earlier by the U.S. setting 1 January 1946 as the date for Soviet withdrawal. During the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, on 19 December 1945, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Secretary of State Byrnes tried to settle the Iranian problem with Stalin. Bevin proposed that a joint commission of the Big Three be sent to Iran to investigate the Azerbaijan problem, but the proposal was rejected by the USSR.  Disenchanted by the outcome of the Moscow Conference and unable to do anything within northern Iran because of Soviet interference, the Iranian government, on 19 January 1946, requested a meeting of the newly created UN Security Council, alleging that Soviet interference in Iran's internal affairs would likely cause international friction. The U.K.'s major response was to introduce a resolution in the Security Council on 25 January calling for bilateral negotiations between Iran and the USSR. On the 30th the Council passed a modified resolution to that effect, which also requested the parties to inform the Council of the results. Moscow declared that direct negotiations were the best path to a settlement and rejected the Council's jurisdiction in the dispute. On 19 February Iranian Premier Qavam left for Moscow in an attempt to negotiate a solution.  During Qavam's negotiations in Moscow the deadline arrived for the evacuation of foreign troops from Iran (as stipulated in the January 1942 tripartite treaty). All U.S. troops had withdrawn by 1 January 1946; and Britain had declared that its troops would be out by the stipulated date of 2 March. By contrast, Radio Moscow announced on 1 March that, except for the northern provinces, Soviet forces would remain in other parts of Iran pending clarification of the situation. In fact, the USSR began to pour new forces into Iran: on 4 and 5 March Soviet troops and armored columns moved outward from Tabriz in three directions--toward the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers and toward Teheran.  The movement of Soviet troops in Iran, combined with an intensive Soviet diplomatic and propaganda offensive against Turkey, the main bastion against the USSR's advance into the Middle East, triggered a crisis for the United States on 4 March 1946: its global and regional influence was threatened. The U.S. responded on the 7th with a decision by Byrnes to send a sharply worded protest to Moscow and to instruct the U.S. delegation to the Security Council to take a firm position on the Iranian case. The Note, which was far stronger than any previous U.S. communication to the Soviet Union, was delivered in Moscow on 9 March and catalyzed a crisis for the USSR. It called on Moscow to explain Soviet troop movements and the continued presence of Soviet troops in Iran. The Soviet government, in a Tass news agency broadcast on 14 March, stated that Washington's report of troop movements was incorrect.  The State Department followed up its Note by declaring the same day that the U.S. would bring the dispute to the Security Council if the differences between the Soviet Union and Iran were not settled before the forthcoming Council meeting on 25 March, and if Iran itself did not raise the issue at the UN forum. In fact, on 18 March Iran did request the Security Council to place the Azerbaijan issue on its agenda. When the Soviets failed to keep the Iranian case off the Council's agenda, they attempted to postpone debate until 1 April. When this too was defeated, the Soviet delegate, Gromyko, left the Council chamber.  The strong position adopted by the U.S., the resistance of Iran, world public opinion, and the publicity of the Security Council meetings led the Soviet leadership to decide on 24 March to announce to the Council, two days later, that an agreement between the USSR and Iran had been reached and that Soviet troops would be withdrawn from Iran within 5-6 weeks if no unforeseen circumstances occurred. After that announcement the Iranian case was temporarily removed from the Security Council agenda. On 4 April 1946 Prime Minister Qavam concluded an agreement with the Soviets that declared that Iranian territory would be evacuated within six weeks of 24 March, that a joint Soviet-Iranian oil company would be established (to be ratified by the Majlis within seven months after 24 March), and that Moscow recognized Azerbaijan as an internal problem of Iran. Finally, on 9 May 1946, Soviet troops left Iran, terminating the Azerbaijan crisis for Iran, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR.
The first of three crises over Indonesia's struggle for independence began on 29 September 1945 and terminated on 25 March 1947. The crisis actors were the Netherlands and Indonesia. A crisis for the Netherlands was triggered on 29 September 1945 when the Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia announced that his troops would maintain law and order in the Netherlands East Indies until a lawful government was again functioning, and that Indonesian leader Ahmad Sukarno was to continue to direct civil administration in those areas not occupied by Allied forces. This was regarded by the Netherlands as de facto recognition of the provisional Indonesian government and, therefore, a grave threat to its influence, long sustained by the Dutch empire. The Hague responded on 1 October with an official statement that the Netherlands would neither recognize nor negotiate with Sukarno.  Indonesia's crisis was triggered on 2 October by the arrival of a Dutch administrator and the landing of additional Dutch forces, interpreted by the Indonesians as a Dutch effort to restore colonial rule. Severe fighting ensued between nationalist and Dutch and British forces. On 13 October 1945 Indonesia responded with a declaration of war against the Netherlands and the prohibition of the sale of food to the enemy. The British were accused of promoting the return of the Dutch administration.  In an attempt to diffuse the situation, Britain began removing troops, and on 19 January 1946 sent Special Ambassador Archibald Clark Kerr (Lord Inverchapel) to assist in resolving the dispute. With Kerr present, mediation began on 10 February 1946 between Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir and Dr. Van Mook of the Netherlands. Kerr did not formulate proposals, but acted to moderate differences between the sides. However, talks stalled and met an impasse at Hoge Veluwe on 14 April.  The UK replaced Kerr with Lord Killearn in August, and on 7 October 1946, Killearn chaired talks that led to the Linggadjati negotiations. These negotiations ended on 15 November but were not signed until March of 1947. In late 1946 British forces were withdrawn. However, the fighting continued between the Dutch and nationalist forces, along with prolonged negotiations, until the signing of the Linggadjati Agreement on 25 March 1947, which provided for a transitional regime until 1 January 1949 at which time the Dutch government would transfer authority to an independent Republic of Indonesia. The agreement, which terminated the first international crisis over Indonesia's independence, provided for a truce and stabilization of existing military positions, the establishment of a Truce Supervisory Committee composed of Dutch, British, and Indonesian representatives, and the creation of the United States of Indonesia linked to the Netherlands.  The UN Security Council was involved because of a joint USSR-Ukrainian complaint on the issue of Dutch military intervention. Draft resolutions calling for on-the-spot investigation and limitation--and withdrawal--of British forces were rejected. The U.S. and the USSR were not active in this early post-World War II crisis, except for the latter's verbal support for Indonesia's nationalists at the UN and in general.
The USSR experienced a crisis with Poland, from 30 June 1946 to 19 January 1947. The post-World War II situation in Poland was extremely tense as thousands of armed persons, belonging to various underground movements, aimed at sabotaging the Communist-controlled Lublin coalition government established in 1944. The presence of Soviet troops added to the complex environment. On 30 June 1946 the Provisional Government of Poland held a preelection referendum that pointed to the fact that the strongest political force in the country was Mikolajczyk's Peasant Party. This triggered a crisis for the USSR, which feared Poland's withdrawal from the Soviet bloc. The Polish Communist leaders were summoned immediately to Moscow for consultations. The major Soviet response came on 28 August when, at a meeting in Moscow with leaders of both the Polish United Workers Party (PUWP) and the Peasant Party, Stalin dictated the results of the forthcoming elections in Poland, demanding that Mikolajczyk ally his party with the Polish Communists.  On 19 January 1947 elections were held and were predictably won by the alliance of the PUWP and Peasant Party, despite charges of gross irregularities. As Poland's potential defection from the Soviet bloc had been prevented, the Soviet crisis was over.  The U.K. and the U.S. were involved politically with notes and statements vis-à-vis the elections and border issues. The UN was not involved. There was no violence.
A second post-World War II crisis over the Straits, arising from renewed Soviet demands for a revision of the Montreux Convention, occurred for Turkey and the United States between 7 August and 26 October 1946. The crisis trigger for Turkey and the United States was a Note from the USSR on 7 August 1946, requesting a revised international regime for the Straits. Simultaneously, the Soviets began naval maneuvers in the Black Sea and a concentration of forces in the Caucasus. Turkey viewed this as additional pressure from the Soviets for bases on its territory. On 11 August Moscow broadcast the content of a series of documents allegedly found in the archives of the German foreign office that recorded violent anti-Soviet statements by Turkey's former Premier and President Inönü. Ankara denied the authenticity of these documents two days later. The U.S. major response occurred on 20 August 1946: after meetings between President Truman and his top advisors, Washington opted for a show of force by sending army and naval forces into the area. With U.S. backing, Turkey was able to give a firm response on 22 August resisting the Soviet demands, while expressing a willingness to participate with all the original signatories in a conference to revise the Montreux Convention. Another Soviet Note followed on 24 September, milder in tone. On 9 October the United States sent a Note to the Soviet Union reaffirming its support for Turkey. The U.K. did the same.  Increased U.S. and British naval activity in the region preceded Turkey's total rejection of Soviet demands, which was contained in a Note to Moscow on 18 October. On the 26th the USSR relented: word was passed to London that, in the Soviets' opinion, a conference on the Straits at that time was premature, thereby terminating the crisis for both Turkey and the U.S. Moreover, once Soviet troops had begun to withdraw from Iran (see Case #108--Azerbaijan, in Multiregional PCs: Iran/USSR), there was a growing feeling in Turkey that the USSR would not use force to achieve its goal relating to the Straits.  The UN played no role. And violence was not used by any crisis actor.
Greece experienced an international crisis during its lengthy civil war; the crisis began on 13 November 1946 and ended on 28 February 1947. A Communist attempt to seize power in Greece in December 1944 was crushed by British forces. Many of the guerrillas escaped to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Bulgaria, all of which provided sanctuary and military support (see Case #98--Greek Civil War I, in Europe: Non-PCs). The civil war continued in the north of Greece with few lulls in the fighting. On 13 November 1946 a major attack was launched by Greek guerrillas at Skra. The seriousness of the situation triggered a crisis for Greece, which feared the possible effect on its political system. Aid to the Greek Communist rebels by the Communist regime in Yugoslavia made that country Greece's principal adversary.  A full-scale military operation against the rebels was launched by the Greek army on 18 November. On 3 December Greece also responded with an appeal to the United Nations Security Council. UN activity took the form of a fact-finding mission in January 1947 authorized by the Security Council. (An earlier Security Council discussion [Jan. 1946] on British forces in Greece ended without any UN action.) The mission found that infiltration across Greece's frontiers was indeed taking place. The crisis may be said to have ended on 28 February 1947, the day the U.S. government invited Greek officials to draft a letter asking for aid. Two weeks later President Truman requested Congress to provide economic and military assistance to the Athens regime (see Case #114).  The outcome of this specific crisis was a compromise because the conflict continued for more than two years after the termination of Greece's crisis with neighboring states aiding Greek Communist guerrillas. The Greek civil war ended on 10 July 1949 when Tito announced the closing of Yugoslavia's border to Greek guerrillas. One month later the Greek army launched an offensive and, within two weeks, the guerrillas were crushed. Prior to Tito's action the army had been unable to suppress the Greek communists, despite its military superiority.
A crisis between the Soviet Union and Hungary began on 10 February and terminated on 1 June 1947. The Soviet army liberated Hungary from German occupation at the end of World War II and was the dominant factor in the Allied Control Commission (ACC) which administered the country after 1945. With Soviet support, the Hungarian Communist Party began to organize itself as a political force. In 1947 the government of Hungary was a coalition of the Smallholder, Social-Democratic, National Peasant, and Communist parties. Although the Smallholders had obtained a majority, the party was obliged by the Soviet-led ACC to form a coalition and grant the Communists the key post of Ministry of the Interior, thus enabling them to control the police. In December 1946 a conspiracy to overthrow the regime was uncovered, with the Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party, Bela Kovács, being implicated. An investigation by Hungarian police began. The trigger to the Soviet crisis was the change created by the signing of the Peace Treaty on 10 February 1947: it called for the withdrawal of occupation forces from Hungary within six months. The Soviets perceived this to be a threat to their control of Hungary and responded on 26 February with the arrest of Kovács on charges of undermining the security of the Soviet occupation forces. This act triggered a crisis for Hungary, which viewed Kovács's arrest as a challenge to the elite and the regime. In March there was another purge of the Smallholders Party extending to members of parliament and ministers in the government. When Prime Minister Nagy was away from Hungary, on vacation in Switzerland, the Soviet authorities presented the Hungarian government with a record of the Kovács interrogation wherein Nagy was named as a fellow conspirator. When Nagy refused to return to the country for fear of arrest, he was asked to resign. This was accompanied by threats to the safety of his son, still in Hungary. Nagy decided to do so on 30 May. The termination for both crisis actors was his formal resignation on 1 June 1947. Hungarian political resistance had been broken (see Case #155--Hungarian Uprising, in 1956, in Europe: Non-PCs).  The U.S. and the U.K. asked for a three-power inquiry into Kovács's arrest. Notes with the USSR were exchanged. There was no UN involvement.
An international crisis culminating in the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine lasted from 21 February to 22 May 1947. There were three crisis actors: Greece, Turkey, and the United States. Soviet demands for the transfer of Turkish territories in 1945 and 1946 deepened U.S. suspicion about USSR intentions in the eastern Mediterranean (see Cases #106 and #111). In Greece, civil war was raging, with support and bases for Greek Communists being supplied by Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria (see Case #112). Thus societal unrest and mass violence were rampant in Greece. Labor strikes erupted in the cities. And on 30 January 1946 martial law was declared. The U.K., struggling to restore economic stability at home following the massive dislocations of World War II, decided it could no longer bear the burden of military and economic aid to Greece and economic assistance to Turkey. The U.K. announcement on 21 February 1947 of its intention to discontinue aid to Greece and Turkey by 31 March triggered a crisis for the U.S., Greece, and Turkey. For the U.S., the issue was fear of Soviet hegemony in the eastern Mediterranean region, while Greece and Turkey perceived a threat to their respective political regimes. Turkey felt obliged to keep its army fully mobilized in order to discourage and forestall Soviet aggression. Its major response, on 21 February, was to request aid from the U.S. Similarly, upon the advice of President Truman, Greece responded to the U.K. announcement by sending a formal Note to Washington on 27 February requesting U.S. aid. Truman asked Congress on 12 March to grant military and economic assistance to Greece and Turkey in order to offset communist threats. The crisis for all three states ended when an aid bill was signed on 22 May 1947. This marked the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine, with a U.S. offer of aid to countries threatened by the Communist bloc during the first stage of the Cold War.  There was no discussion about Turkey in the United Nations; but the Security Council established a commission to investigate Greek border violations. The report, issued in May 1947, called for an end to external assistance to Greek Communist guerrillas. A resolution to that effect, and with it further UN activity, was vetoed by the USSR.
A crisis for the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia over the Marshall Plan occurred between 3 and 11 July 1947. Severe winters in 1945 and 1946 and a drought in 1947 had caused great economic hardship in Czechoslovakia. The food supply was severely reduced, and all goods originally destined for domestic consumption had to be exported. Both unemployment and citizen discontent were rising rapidly. Consequently, when an invitation was issued by France and Great Britain to Czechoslovakia to attend a conference in Paris dealing with the Marshall Plan and U.S. conditions for aid, it was readily accepted and a delegation was sent. The proposal of large-scale economic aid to Europe, in an address by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall at Harvard University on 5 June 1947, elicited a favorable response from Central and Eastern European states, notably Czechoslovakia and Poland. Soviet leaders were uncertain about U.S. motives but, initially, were not hostile to the "Marshall Plan." In fact, they participated actively in the first Paris meeting on the plan from 26 June to 3 July.  It was during that meeting that Soviet perceptions changed. One reason was concern that Marshall Plan aid to Germany would lead to an increase in German industrial capacity, evoking memories of the havoc wreaked by an economically powerful Germany during the war. Another was a dispute over the procedure for submitting aid requests to the U.S. and its implications: the U.K. and France preferred a coordinated list for all of Europe produced by a multinational committee; the Soviets wanted to aggregate all individual requests and to submit them to Washington. Important as these issues were, their primary impact was to rekindle Soviet fears that the U.S., along with the U.K. and France, intended to use economic aid as an instrument to undermine Soviet hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, areas where its control was tenuous barely two years after the end of World War II. It was this perception that triggered the USSR's Marshall Plan crisis, as evident in Molotov's volte-face. The Soviet foreign minister's opening statement at the conference on 26 June was moderate. His closing speech on 3 July before his dramatic exit from the conference articulated this dramatic change: he accused the Western powers of planning to divide Europe into hostile camps; and he declared that Moscow would no longer cooperate with the Marshall Plan.  For several days, however, the Soviet attitude remained ambivalent. Thus the Czechoslovak cabinet's decision on 4 July to accept the Anglo-French invitation to participate in the next Paris meeting, scheduled for the 12th, was approved by Molotov on the 5th in a back-channel message to Prague. Czechoslovakia formally announced its acceptance of the invitation on the 7th. The next day Molotov demanded that Prague retract its acceptance.  By then Soviet skepticism, reinforced by negative assessments of U.S. motives (from the USSR's Ambassador to the United States, Novikov) and of the economic consequences (from its most influential economic planner, Varga) had turned to outright hostility. This was expressed by Stalin to a Czechoslovak government delegation, headed by Communist Party leader and Prime Minister Gottwald, along with the non-communist Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Masaryk and Dritna. On 9 July Stalin delivered an ultimatum calling upon Prague to rescind its acceptance of the invitation to participate in the Marshall Plan talks in Paris: he told the delegation that Czech. participation would be "an unfriendly act." This triggered a crisis for Czechoslovakia, which was virtually surrounded by Soviet troops. It responded the following day by compliance to Soviet wishes. The Czech. ministers in Moscow telephoned their cabinet colleagues in Prague and requested them to rescind the earlier decision to participate in the Paris meetings. The Czech. cabinet met at 4:00 a.m. and did so. The 11th of July was the termination date for both actors in the 1947 Marshall Plan crisis. There was no violence.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.  (A more far-reaching Soviet response to the threat posed by the Marshall Plan occurred after the crisis ended: at a conference of nine communist parties in Poland on 22-27 September 1947 the Communist Information Bureau (COMINFORM) was founded--to propagate the Soviet line internationally, through European communist parties. It was regarded in the West as a successor to the Communist (or Third) International (COMINTERN), founded by Lenin in 1919 and disbanded in 1943 by Stalin as a gesture to his Western allies. At that conference its founder, Stalin aide Andrei Zhdanov, in a speech on "the International Situation," first propounded the Soviet doctrine that became paramount throughout the Cold War, namely, the division of Europe by the West into "two camps," which he traced primarily to the Marshall Plan.)
The second crisis over the Netherlands' opposition to Indonesia's declaration of independence occurred between 21 July 1947 and 17 January 1948. The Linggadjati Agreement of 25 March 1947, which called for the transfer of power by the Netherlands to Indonesia on 1 January 1949, was regarded by many Dutch colonials as inadequate in its provisions for the protection of Dutch interests. Indonesians, on the other hand, felt that Prime Minister Sjahrir had gone too far in conceding to Dutch demands; he resigned on 3 July 1947 as internal pressure mounted. Indonesia's second crisis was triggered on 21 July 1947 when the Netherlands, dissatisfied with the deteriorating relations between the two countries, authorized the launching of military action. Indonesia's response, on 22 July, was an appeal to India for aid and foreign intervention. India, and later Australia, brought the issue to the Security Council. Its discussion on 31 July, with the implied danger of international intervention, was the crisis trigger for the Netherlands. That day, the Dutch representative to the Security Council denied UN jurisdiction over what he termed a police action in an internal Dutch matter. He set forth the Netherlands' conditions for reopening talks.  The UN formed a Good Offices Committee (GOC), which served as an instrument of mediation in the crisis beginning in August of 1947. On 8 December, the first meeting of the GOC with the belligerents was held on the USS Renville. The GOC proposed terms of agreement on 25 December, but neither party found the proposal satisfactory. On 2 January 1948, the Dutch formulated a counterproposal that gave the individual Indonesian territories greater discretion over whether and how sovereignty was to be transferred from the Netherlands to the United States of Indonesia, and the GOC added six additional principles. Under the new plan, either party could request the continuation of the Good Offices Committee’s services, and a referendum would be held in six to twelve months to let the individual territories decide who would be in control. A constitutional convention would then be held in which any state could decide to ratify the constitution or create a special relationship with either the Netherlands or the United States of Indonesia.  The crisis ended on 17 January 1948 when the parties agreed to the Dutch and GOC principles while gathered on the USS Renville. U.S. activity helped to bring about the Renville Agreement, calling for a truce and adopting the UN Good Offices Committee's recommendation for a plebiscite.
This Caribbean crisis had only one actor, the Dominican Republic, and lasted from 26 July until 28 September 1947. President Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic since 1930, had seized control of all the instruments of power (army, courts, press, economy) and had crushed all opposition. The result was a large number of political exiles from the Dominican Republic seeking shelter in neighboring states such as Cuba and Guatemala. They in turn were joined by exiles, mercenaries, adventurers, and criminals from other states in the region. This group was known as the "Caribbean League."  These states, with Cuba the most supportive, supplied weapons, training, bases, and money, as well as ideological support, to the League's activities.  The crisis, therefore, was the result of a military threat to the Trujillo regime by the Caribbean League, with Cuba taking the lead. The exiles began gathering at Cayo Conlites (Cuba) as early as January 1946, with the Cuban government providing training and support. By 26 July 1947 the Trujillo regime perceived the exiles to be a serious military threat. Dominican precautions in the form of blackouts were instituted on that day. The Dominican Republic's major response occurred on 18 August when Trujillo voiced the possibility of war breaking out and suggested setting up an international commission to investigate the matter. The Dominican armed forces were put on alert. On 28 September the Cubans disbanded the revolutionary forces at the same time as the U.S. began to be negatively involved--prohibiting the purchase of U.S. weapons. The immediate threat subsided, but the conflict was to continue for several more years, with later involvement of the OAS; and a crisis erupted in 1949 (see Case #130--Luperon).  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
The crisis between India and Pakistan over Junagadh took place from 17 August 1947 to 24 February 1948. The news of Junagadh's accession to Pakistan on 17 August 1947 triggered a crisis for India. New Delhi responded on 25 October by approving a plan to occupy Mangrol and Babariawad with civil personnel accompanied by a small military force. This triggered a crisis for Pakistan on 1 November 1947. After the nawab left Junagadh, its government formally requested India to assist in the administration. Accordingly, instructions were issued on 9 November to occupy Junagadh, marking the termination of India's crisis.  Pakistan's response on 11 November took the form of a reply by Liaquat Ali Khan to a cable from Nehru requesting a discussion on Junagadh. Pakistan's prime minister contended that, since Junagadh had already acceded to Pakistan, there was no room for discussion and that India's action was a clear violation of Pakistani territory. However, Pakistan was in no position to defend Junagadh because they were not contiguous and Junagadh was 300 miles from the sea. Pakistan's crisis ended on 24 February 1948 when a plebiscite was held in Junagadh, reinforcing India's control over the state.  The U.K. was deeply involved in this crisis. Lord Mountbatten, India's last viceroy and governor-general, held talks in Lahore with Liaquat Ali Khan and received Pakistan's agreement to hold a plebiscite in Junagadh. The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved.
The first crisis between India and Pakistan over Kashmir lasted from 24 October 1947 to 1 January 1949. In 1847 the British sold the Vale of Kashmir to the Dogra ruler of Jammu who, in turn, acknowledged British paramountcy. In 1947 it was run along orthodox Hindu lines. If the disposition of Jammu and Kashmir had been made according to the principles applied to British India, the state--with the possible exception of a Hindu majority area in Jammu, adjacent to the Indian Punjab--would have gone to Pakistan. At that time Kashmir had a Hindu ruler, with an overwhelming Muslim population, approximately 75 percent of more than four million. However, the power of decision rested with the maharaja. Accession to a democratic India had no appeal for him; but the future looked even less promising in a Muslim Pakistan.  The last viceroy of British India visited Kashmir in July 1947 in an effort to convince the maharaja to accede to either India or Pakistan. However, he was suspicious of the British and resisted Mountbatten's pressure to make a definite decision. Hoping to achieve independence, the maharaja arrested most of the state's politicians and tried to arrange "standstill agreements"--status quo arrangements--with both India and Pakistan.  The importance of this territory for Pakistan lay in the fact that the upper regions of four of the rivers upon which Pakistan depended for irrigation--the Indus River and its tributaries--were inside Kashmir or on the border. The location of Kashmir, contiguous to India and Pakistan, Chinese-controlled Tibet, and the Afghanistan-controlled narrow Wakhan corridor leading to the Soviet Union, endowed it with strategic value. For India, in addition to the strategic dimension, Kashmir, the only Muslim majority state in independent India, was crucial to its claim and goal of being a secular, multireligious, pluralist democracy.  The communal rioting in Punjab spread to Jammu, where Hindu and Sikh refugees attacked Muslims. In September a Muslim revolt against the government of Kashmir erupted in the western part of the state. A provisional Azad (Free) Kashmir government was established by the rebels. At this point, with much of the northern and northwestern parts of the subcontinent in near chaos, Muslim tribesmen from the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan invaded Kashmir. Pakistan aided these tribesmen by allowing them to use its territory as a base and enabling them to pass through to Kashmir. The trigger to India's crisis was an invasion of the Kashmir valley by Pakistan-armed and Pakistan-backed Muslim tribesmen from the North West Frontier Province on 24 October 1947. The (Hindu) maharaja of Kashmir immediately appealed to India for help in suppressing the threat to his rule. India responded on the 26th, only after receiving Kashmir's formal accession, by ordering an airlift of troops, equipment, and supplies into the area. This triggered Pakistan's crisis on 27 October.  On 6 February 1948 rebel forces launched an attack on the key junction of Naushara. At that point Pakistani officers realized that the Azad Kashmir forces could not hold the Indian army. They decided to maintain the Pakistani Seventh Division in position behind the front. Pakistan's major response came on 17 March 1948, long after it had become involved in a related crisis over Junagadh: Pakistan launched an unsuccessful attack on Poonch that resulted in an Indian spring offensive. The crisis over Kashmir ended for both India and Pakistan with a UN-mediated cease-fire on 1 January 1949.  India referred the issue to the UN, charging Pakistan with complicity in the tribal invasion: it asked the Security Council to call upon Pakistan to halt its assistance to the Muslim tribesmen fighting in Kashmir. Pakistan charged New Delhi with genocide. Resolutions were adopted on 15 and 17 January 1948 calling upon the parties to refrain from aggression. A UN Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) was established to investigate and mediate the dispute. UNCIP consisted of members from the US, Belgium, Colombia, Argentina and Czechoslovakia, and it arrived on 7 July 1948. After meeting with both sides without much success UNCIP submitted a three-part resolution proposing a cease-fire, Indian and Pakistani withdrawals, with India retaining forces in Kashmir to maintain order, and a plebiscite. Pakistan refused. A cease-fire resolution of the Security Council was finally accepted by both parties in December 1948 and took effect on 1 January 1949.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (Since then two-thirds of Jammu and Kashmir has been occupied by India and one-third by Pakistan, with a UN Observer Group to monitor the cease-fire. Almost half a century later, the conflict over Kashmir remains unresolved).
The first of many international crises in the protracted Arab/Israel conflict had six direct participants: Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Israel. It lasted from 29 November 1947 until 20 July 1949. Viewed in interstate terms the conflict generated a crisis only with the birth pangs of the Jewish state in 1947-48. The situation in Palestine deteriorated rapidly as it became clear to all parties that the U.K., the Mandatory Power, was planning to relinquish its control over the area. As riots and instability increased, the decision regarding the future political solution for Palestine was placed on the UN agenda. The UN General Assembly Resolution of 29 November 1947, calling for the partition of Palestine into two independent states, one Arab, the other predominantly Jewish, triggered a crisis for Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Their initial response was a four-day summit meeting of Arab states on 8 December. On the 17th the Arab League reaffirmed its determination to maintain Palestine as an Arab state and announced plans to recruit an army of volunteers from League members.  The other Arab states objected to Jordan's plan to annex all of Palestine when the British Mandate ended. No further action was taken until May 1948.  Arab attacks on Jewish settlements in Palestine preceded the British evacuation; but regular Arab armies did not enter the area until the end of the Mandate on 14 May 1948.  The proclamation of the State of Israel on 14-15 May 1948, though anticipated, sharply escalated the crisis for the five Arab states. Plans for a combined army of Arab League forces, to be organized under an Iraqi commander, fell through; and directives were sent to each country to dispatch regular forces to Palestine. All the Arab states perceived a serious threat--the loss of territory that for centuries had been an integral part of the "Arab world." They responded by invading Israel on 15 May--Syria and Lebanon in the north, Jordan and Iraq in the east, and Egypt in the south. The Arab invasion triggered an existence crisis for the new state. Israel responded the same day by dispatching its newly formed regular army to fight on all fronts. A struggle for influence among Arab states and their fear that Jordan's King Abdullah would enlarge his domain by annexing all of Palestine and part of Syria accentuated the Arab decision to fight but created the seeds of disunity and disharmony in the first Arab/Israel war.  The crisis ended at different times for different participants. Fighting in the north ended on 30 October 1948 for Lebanon and Syria in defeat; but it was their armistice agreements with Israel on 23 March and 20 July 1949, respectively, that marked the termination of their crisis. With Iraq, unlike the four other Arab states, there was no formal agreement to end the war; but fighting effectively ceased after 18 July 1948. Fighting ended for Egypt with its defeat in Sinai in early January 1949 (see Case #128); and an armistice agreement was signed on 24 February 1949. The war ended for Israel after it captured Eilat on the Red Sea, and the Israeli government ratified the armistice agreement with Egypt on 10 March 1949. Israel and Jordan signed their armistice agreement on 3 April 1949. The last of the four armistice agreements was signed with Syria on 20 July 1949.  The UN was intensely involved in this crisis, arranging four truce agreements and brokering armistice agreements through the mediation of Count Folke Bernadotte and, after his assassination on 17 September 1948, Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche. Bernadotte intended to find a settlement based on the military status quo and not the UN Partition lines (i.e., to give Israel all of Galilee and Jordan the Negev). He mediated a series of truces that ultimately proved unsuccessful. When Bunche assumed the mediation duties, he wanted to replace the truces with more permanent armistices, and he used bilateral negotiations between Israel and each Arab state, beginning with Egypt, as the means to do so. In addition to Bunche’s mediation efforts, the UN General Assembly agreed to the creation of the Palestine Conciliation Commission (PCC) on 11 December 1948. The PCC had a more ambitious goal of using mediation to achieve permanent peace treaties among the belligerents but failed. Bunche’s mediation of the bilateral armistices between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria proved most instrumental in achieving crisis management.  The two superpowers and the former Mandatory Power were actively involved: the USSR as the primary source of weapons for the State of Israel acting indirectly through Czechoslovakia; the U.S. and the U.K. playing an important political role within and outside the UN.
The Czech. regime crisis for the USSR and Czechoslovakia occurred from 13 to 25 February 1948. The 1946 elections in Czechoslovakia resulted in a coalition government in which the Communists were the largest single party. Klement Gottwald, the Communist leader, became Prime Minister, and Jan Masaryk, son of the first President, Thomas Masaryk, and a liberal belonging to no party, was appointed Foreign Minister. A campaign of intimidation against non-Communist ministers of the Czechoslovak cabinet began in the autumn of 1947. Elections were scheduled for May 1948. A preelection poll commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior pointed to a Communist Party defeat, although there were indications of genuine Czech. sentiment toward the USSR as liberator and protector against Germany. There was, as well, some popular sympathy with Soviet economic goals.  The desperate state of the national economy, increasing police malpractice, threats from the trade unions, and other political disturbances were present in Czechoslovakia in January and February 1948. In January the Czech. coalition government accused the Czech. secret police of direct cooperation with the Soviet NKVD. On 13 February all non-communist regional commanders of the police in Prague were suddenly retired or transferred. The cabinet ordered the Communist minister of the interior to reinstate the non-communist police. As a result of the nonimplementation of this order, 12 members of the cabinet resigned in protest. The Czech. cabinet resignations triggered a crisis for the USSR on 13 February 1948. The Soviets, fearing that early elections would adversely affect communist supremacy in Czechoslovakia, responded on the 19th by dispatching Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin to Prague, ostensibly to supervise an incoming shipment of Soviet wheat. He immediately called upon Czech. President Benes suggesting that the USSR was interested in seeing Prime Minister Gottwald succeed in solving the cabinet crisis. This constituted the trigger for the Czech. crisis. The Czech. response, and the termination of the crisis for both actors, occurred on 25 February when Benes, fearing Soviet military intervention, yielded to Zorin's and Gottwald's pressure and accepted the resignations of non-communist cabinet ministers, despite his own reluctance and demonstrations outside the president's palace.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.  (The bloodless coup enabled the Communists to retain control of Czechoslovakia. It was alleged that Soviet troops participated in the coup, directly or indirectly. On 10 March 1948 Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk was found dead--a suicide or a victim of assassination--on the ground below his apartment in the foreign ministry. Czechoslovakia maintained that the coup was an internal matter and declined a Security Council invitation on 6 April to participate in UN deliberations. A draft resolution by Argentina and Chile on 29 April calling for an inquiry into the regime changes was vetoed by the Soviet Union in the Security Council. The U.S. criticized Soviet behavior.)
Finland was in a state of crisis with the USSR from 22 February until 6 April 1948. On 9 February 1948 there was a meeting of representatives of the Nordic states. The Soviet Union felt that Nordic cooperation, backed by the West and, specifically, by the United States, posed a threat to Soviet hegemony in northern Europe. On 22 February the Soviet Union sent a Note to the Finnish government requesting a meeting of high-level officials for the purpose of concluding a Treaty of Mutual Friendship, Cooperation, and Non-Aggression. Such a treaty would effectively prevent Finland from adopting a pro-Western stance. Finland responded on 8 March 1948 by sending a delegation to Moscow.  The crisis ended on 6 April 1948 with the signing of a treaty. There was no violence and no overt threats by the Soviet Union. The negotiations seemed to proceed smoothly, and all parties appeared satisfied with the outcome. However, a message from Stalin was construed as containing an implied threat of Soviet military action if Finland did not comply with Moscow's proposal. The crisis was a turning point in Finnish/Soviet relations: it led to a basic change in Finland's foreign policy orientation and created the phenomenon of "Finlandization," namely, curtailing the freedom of action in international relations of a formally sovereign state in the emerging global cold war. The U.S. and the UN were not involved.
The crisis actors in the first of three international crises over Berlin were the France, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR. It began on 24 June 1948 and ended on 12 May 1949. Escalation of tension between the Western powers and the Soviet Union centered around the issue of occupied Germany and, especially, Berlin. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 divided Germany into four zones and Berlin into four sectors, but decreed that the country was to be treated as one economic unit under the Allied Control Council (ACC). The Potsdam rules began to unravel on 6 march 1948 when, during a pause in their Tripartite London Conference, the Western powers issued a communiqué indicating their intention to merge their zones in West Germany. The USSR responded by walking out of an Allied Control Council meeting on 20 march. Then, on 1 April the Russians temporarily restricted Western access to Berlin by the imposition of a "baby blockade." On June 7, the Western powers issued a declaration formalizing their 6 March communiqué, with the stated goal of integrating West Germany into the democratic community of Western Europe. This increased the Soviet perception of threat to communist influence in Europe but not, yet, of the greater likelihood of war. The U.K., the U.S., and France met once more in June. On 7 June 1948 the Western powers published the recommendations of the March 1948 London Conference, to which the Soviet Union had not been invited, to integrate their zones in Germany. This triggered a crisis for Moscow, which perceived a basic threat to its influence in Europe. The USSR responded on 24 June by blockading all Western transportation into and out of Berlin. The Soviets also cut off all electric current, coal, food, and other supplies to West Berlin.  This triggered a crisis for the U.S., the U.K., and France; the future of Germany and, with it, their influence in Europe was at stake. The response by the Western powers, on 26 June 1948, was to step up the airlift to Berlin, which had begun two months earlier, and to continue with plans for the rehabilitation of Germany as part of Western Europe. Talks to break the diplomatic deadlock began in August. By 2l March 1949 the blockade had been almost completely lifted. A full agreement was reached on 12 May, the termination date for all four crisis actors; it left Germany split into two embryonic states -- the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (DDR).  Throughout the crisis, the UN was highly involved in the conflict resolution process but only had limited effect. Following a complaint by France, the U.K., and the U.S. in September 1948, a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for the lifting of the blockade and the resumption of talks was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On 5 October 1948, the Security Council voted to begin discussing the crisis, and a neutral commission, consisting of China, Syria, Canada, Belgium, Colombia and Argentina, was set up to study the currency problem and mediate. However, it failed to achieve an agreement among the Four Powers. Appeals by the UN Secretary-General and the president of the General Assembly also had no effect. Talks were held in the winter of 1949 between the Soviet and U.S. representatives to the UN. The status of Berlin catalyzed a second crisis in November 1958 (see Case #168--Berlin Deadline).
India experienced a crisis over Hyderabad from 21 August to 18 September 1948. Hyderabad was the second largest princely state in the subcontinent, after Jammu and Kashmir. It is located in the geographic center of India and, in 1948, 80 percent of its population was Hindu while most of the political elite were Muslim. The nizam of Hyderabad did not favor accession to distant Pakistan. Nor did predominantly Hindu India attract him. He therefore opted for independence a few days after the British left. The Indian government stated that Hyderabad was far too important to India's territorial integrity and economic needs to be permitted to choose independence.  Throughout late 1947 and early 1948 tension and communal violence mounted. India, insisting that the nizam liberalize his government and curb the violence, organized an economic blockade. The nizam then loaned Pakistan some of his Government of India securities which it began to cash, despite promises not to do so while the Standstill Agreement between Hyderabad and India continued to operate. These developments, coupled with border raids and frequent attacks on trains passing through the state territory, had undermined the Standstill Agreement. Hyderabad raised the question of arbitration on the alleged breaches of the Agreement; but the infringements had become relatively unimportant in the context of the increasing deterioration of law and order within the state. India's crisis over the state of Hyderabad, which had proclaimed its independence, was triggered on 21 August 1948 by Hyderabad's request for UN discussion of India's economic blockade and incidents of violence in the area. India's reply to a grave threat to its territorial integrity came on 9 September after efforts to deploy Indian troops in the state failed. A decision was taken to send troops into Hyderabad to restore law and order: this was implemented on the 15th. The crisis terminated on 18 September 1948 when an Indian military governor was appointed and a military administration was installed in Hyderabad.  On 23 September the nizam sent a cable to the Security Council withdrawing the Hyderabad case from its agenda. Pakistan continued to press for discussion, but it was ultimately dropped. Hyderabad's complaint to the Security Council was included in the Council's provisional agenda. India argued that, because Hyderabad was not an independent state, it had no right to seek international legal intervention in what was a purely domestic affair.  There was no substantive consideration of the question at the UN. Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
The international crisis resulting from the civil war in China involved Nationalist China and the United States as crisis actors from 23 September 1948 to 8 December 1949. On 23 September 1948 the strongly fortified city of Tsinan, Shantung's capital, fell to the Chinese Communists, triggering a crisis for the United States: the city was lost after the defection of an entire division of Nationalist soldiers. For the United States the Nationalist setback posed in increasingly acute form the threat of loss of U.S. influence in China and the question of granting large-scale military aid, including the eventual use of U.S. armed forces, to a government that had lost the confidence of its own troops and its own people. By the autumn of 1948 the whole of northeast China had fallen into Communist hands.  U.S. decision makers undertook an extensive policy review in October, and on the 26th the U.S. responded to the crisis with a decision not to commit military aid to Nationalist China, despite the near-certain consequences of Communist victory in the civil war. This decision ended the crisis for the United States.  Early in January 1949 Nationalist military strength was broken. Throughout that year the Communists gradually achieved control over the mainland. In the spring Nationalist forces began retreating to Taiwan.  The proclamation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949 expanded Nationalist China's internal crisis to international proportions. The response and termination occurred on the same date, 8 December 1949, when the Nationalists formally established the Republic of China (ROC) on the island of Taiwan, thereby tacitly acknowledging the PRC as ruler of mainland China. The United States backed Nationalist claims to be the sole representative of the people of China at the United Nations until 1971.  On 8 December 1949 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all states "to refrain from (a) seeking to acquire spheres of influence or to create foreign controlled regimes within the territory of China; (b) seeking to obtain special rights or privileges within the territory of China." This ended the crisis for China.  The Soviet involvement was political; substantial Soviet forces had been withdrawn from China by October 1948.  Three subsequent crises erupted over the Taiwan Strait and the larger issue of the unresolved China civil war, in 1954, 1958, and 1962 (see Cases #146, #166, and #192).
A crisis for Costa Rica took place from 11 December 1948 until 21 February 1949. Civil war broke out in Costa Rica in March 1948. President Picado, who supported former President Calderón, opposed the election in February of Otilio Ulate as President. Ulate fled the country, and Picado was subsequently overthrown. He left Costa Rica for Nicaragua on 20 April. The country was then governed by a 10-man military junta headed by José Figueres. A crisis for Costa Rica was triggered on 11 December 1948 by an invasion of about 1,000 men, primarily Nicaraguan National Guardsmen, and a number of exiled supporters of Calderón. Costa Rica's response, the same day, was an order for immediate mobilization, the imposition of martial law, and the movement of troops to the frontier with Nicaragua. In addition, Costa Rica appealed to the UN Security Council and the OAS and protested to the Nicaraguan government, which denied the charge. Fighting continued until mid-December, when Costa Rican troops recovered the La Cruz area, which had been occupied by the invaders, and forced them back to the Nicaraguan border.  On 14 December the OAS appointed and dispatched an inquiry commission to the area of conflict to investigate the facts. The committee consisted of representatives from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the U.S., and it served a mediating role by visiting the dispured region, proposing a resolution and issuing a report on the situation. The report, released on 24 December, stated that the invasion had been led by Costa Rican political exiles and criticized Nicaragua for not having prevented it. A military commission was appointed to supervise activity on the Costa Rican/Nicaraguan border. The crisis ended on 21 February 1949, when the two countries signed a treaty of friendship.  The UN discussed Costa Rica's complaint but left the matter to the OAS. The U.S. was marginally involved in this crisis, as part of the inquiry commission. The USSR was not involved.
The last of three interrelated crises between Indonesia and the Netherlands over the former's independence occurred between 19 December 1948 and 27 December 1949. The Linggadjati and Renville Agreements of 25 March 1947 and 17 January 1948 had recognized the de facto authority of the Republic of Indonesia over Java, Sumatra, and Madura. The Dutch, nevertheless, created autonomous regions and states on those islands, thus violating the agreements. Tension began to mount again in 1948, and negotiations reached a deadlock when the Dutch tried to force a one-sided agreement. It became clear to the Indonesians that the Netherlands would once more attempt to solve the problem unilaterally by force. A crisis for Indonesia was triggered on 19 December 1948 when Dutch forces occupied Djakarta and other cities in Java and Sumatra, while capturing eminent Republican political leaders. The trigger for the Netherlands was a critical report to the Security Council by the Good Offices Committee on 23 December 1948, threatening the Dutch empire in Southeast Asia. Indonesia responded on 25 December by setting up an emergency government in Sumatra and appealing to Prime Minister Nehru of India, who transmitted to the Security Council the resolution adopted by the second New Delhi Conference on Indonesia, with strong recommendations for action. The Netherlands responded on the 27th by rejecting the Security Council's call for an immediate cease-fire and the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia after free elections. On the 30th it refused to accept the cease-fire and release political prisoners.  The UN formed the United Nations Commission for Indonesia (UNCI), which included representatives from Australia, Belgium and the United States, to assist in the resolution process. At a meeting on 14 April 1949, the U.S. representative, H. Merle Cochran, proposed 17 points to be considered at a round table discussion between the UNCI and the belligerent actors, held from 23 August to 2 November 1949. Additional international pressure--from the second New Delhi Conference, an Arab League resolution calling for a Dutch cease-fire, and intense U.S. pressure--finally convinced the Netherlands to comply. The crisis ended for both actors on 27 December 1949, when Queen Juliana signed a formal act transferring sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies to the Republic of Indonesia.  The Soviet Union supported Indonesia politically throughout its conflict with the Netherlands, 1945-49. The U.S., on the other hand, changed from supporting the Netherlands to pressing them to sign the Renville Agreement, to securing Dutch compliance with UN resolutions by threatening to suspend U.S. aid.
An intra-war crisis for Egypt, the U.K., and Israel occurred during the first Arab/Israel War and lasted from 25 December 1948 to 10 January 1949. The first of many Arab/Israel wars had begun on 15 May 1948 (see Case #120), with the end of the British Mandate, Israel's proclamation of independence, and the invasion by five Arab states. Egypt's refusal to negotiate an armistice agreement led Israel to increase its efforts to conquer southern territory. On 25 December 1948 Israeli forces launched an attack on the Egyptian army in the south, crossing into the Egyptian-held Sinai peninsula and triggering crises for Egypt and Britain. After an unsuccessful attempt to rally Arab League states to its aid, Egypt responded to this territorial threat on 31 December by appealing to the U.K. to press for a Security Council resolution demanding Israeli withdrawal. Britain, relying on its unrenewed 1936 treaty with Egypt, triggered a crisis for Israel by sending an ultimatum, via the U.S. embassy, on the 31st, demanding the evacuation of Egyptian territory no later than 8 January 1949. Israel responded to this threat of military intervention by changing the direction of its forces while still remaining in Sinai. The crisis was escalated further when Israel shot down five British planes over Israeli territory that had been sent to observe the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Britain reacted strongly by sending military reinforcements to its base in Aqaba, Jordan, on 7 January. That day Israel ordered its troops out of the area, in response to a Security Council call for a cease-fire. This withdrawal was completed by 10 January 1949, the termination date for all three crisis actors.  The U.S. was highly involved politically: it pressed Israel to comply with the U.K. demand. The USSR was aloof from this crisis.
Afghanistan and Pakistan experienced a two-stage crisis over a long-standing border dispute from mid-March 1949 to 5 October 1950. Afghanistan's demand for an independent Pathan state was followed by a propaganda campaign between the two countries in March 1949. The crisis trigger for Afghanistan occurred in mid-March when the Pakistani government arrested infiltrators into its North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and initiated efforts toward more effective control of that region, while rejecting any Afghanistan claims to the territory. On 27 March it was reported that Afghanistan had moved two divisions and part of its air force to the Pakistani frontier. On 2 April Afghanistan recalled its diplomatic representatives to Pakistan. Tension between the two countries increased following an incident on 12 June when a Pakistani plane bombed the village of Moghulgai, 2,100 yards from the frontier. After an investigation by a joint Afghanistan-Pakistan commission, Pakistan took responsibility for an unintentional flight and offered to pay compensation, ending Afghanistan's crisis on 31 July 1949.  On 12 August a large group of Afridi Pathans met on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line and established a Pushtunistan Assembly. When Pushtunistan's independence was proclaimed, it was immediately recognized by Afghanistan.  The tension level remained low for several months. The beginning of 1950 signaled the start of new propaganda campaigns between the two countries. The pro-Pushtunistan movement in Afghanistan strengthened during the spring and summer. Tribal unrest was prevalent, and demands for the separation of Pathanistan increased.  The trigger for Pakistan occurred on 30 September 1950, more than a year after the termination of Afghanistan's crisis, when Afghan troops invaded Pakistan. Pakistan responded with troops and aircraft and succeeded in driving the Afghan forces across the border on 5 October 1950, which marked the termination date of Pakistan's crisis.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved.
This minicrisis involved one actor only, the Dominican Republic. It started on 19 June 1949 and terminated two days later. Tension in the Caribbean region was high, and there had been several attempts by the Caribbean League to overthrow Trujillo, the Dominican Republic's authoritarian ruler (see Case #117--Cuba/Dominican Republic). On 19 June 1949 a planeload of 15 mercenaries from Guatemala landed at Luperon in the Dominican Republic. The plane was destroyed by the Dominican navy, and the expedition was crushed immediately. Although this did not represent a large-scale military threat, Trujillo took the incident seriously and on 21 June sent a protest note to Cuba, along with threatening words to Guatemala--the Dominican Republic's major response to a perceived threat to its political regime. That day the Cuban government announced its determination to stop the enlistment of men to fight as mercenaries, and the crisis terminated, although tension in the area remained high until December 1951, the culmination of all OAS activity to settle the disputes in the region.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
A prolonged crisis for Yugoslavia began on 19 August 1949 and faded in November 1951. Relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia began deteriorating soon after World War II. In January 1948 the Soviet Union communicated its displeasure with what it perceived as Yugoslavia's increasingly independent domestic and foreign policy. In the next few months there were further Russian charges and Yugoslav denials of disloyalty to international communism. In the summer of 1948 Yugoslavia was expelled from the Soviet-dominated Communist Information Bureau (COMINFORM). On 19 August 1949 the Yugoslav government received an ultimatum from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that was perceived as a possible prelude to a military invasion; there was, in fact, a show of force by the Soviet division in Yugoslavia, but Moscow acted so as to avoid involvement in military hostilities against Tito's regime. Yugoslavia responded the same day by placing its forces on alert and conducting military maneuvers along the border. The crisis gradually faded.  In November 1951 Yugoslavia lodged a formal complaint with the UN against the "hostile actions" by the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies. The General Assembly passed a resolution noting Yugoslavia's readiness to seek a peaceful solution. U.S. involvement consisted of economic aid to Yugoslavia. Sanctions by the COMINFORM were imposed on Yugoslavia and, later, by the Soviet bloc's economic organization, COMECON. This crisis led to a basic shift in Yugoslavia's foreign policy orientation and marked a precedent for a Soviet doctrine of the right of intervention, what became known as the "Brezhnev Doctrine" almost two decades later (see Case #227--Prague Spring).
The first international crisis related to the Korean War began on 25 June and ended on 30 September 1950. There were four crisis actors: South Korea, formally the Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States, the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the Republic of China (ROC or Taiwan). There was constant tension, and minor incidents were reported in 1949. That year, too, General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers (SCAP) and de facto ruler in Japan, and Secretary of State Acheson had defined Korea as beyond the U.S. defense perimeter in East Asia. The Chinese Communist regime was preoccupied with internal reconstruction after the China civil war (see Case #125--China Civil War, in 1948-49, in Multiregional PCs: Taiwan Strait), and plans were made for a probable invasion of Taiwan in 1950. From September 1949 until June 1950 the South Korean leader, Syngman Rhee, frequently announced a "march-to-the-north" policy, to unify Korea by force. During June 1950 Kim Il-Sung, the leader of North Korea, initiated an all-out campaign for the reunification of Korea. On 25 June 1950 forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) (North Korea) invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) (South Korea) by crossing the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between the two Koreas. This triggered a crisis for South Korea and the United States. Rhee responded the same day with an appeal to the U.S. for military aid. On 27 June President Truman authorized U.S. forces to fight alongside troops of the ROK. He also reacted to the critical situation developing between the two Chinas by ordering the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait and establishing a naval blockade. This was the trigger for the PRC, whose plans for the invasion of Taiwan were complicated by a possible combined U.S.-Taiwan invasion of the mainland.  The PRC response, on 28 June, was contained in a speech by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai accusing the U.S. of aggression. Taiwan, still fearful of a Chinese Communist invasion, as PRC forces were massed along the coast, perceived Zhou's speech as a threat with possible grave consequences and responded the following day with general mobilization.  A U.S.-sponsored resolution at the Security Council was passed on 25 June by a vote of 9 to 0, with Yugoslavia abstaining and the Soviet Union absent--its delegates had walked out of the Council. The resolution condemned the North Korean attack and demanded the immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of North Korean forces to the 38th Parallel. A second Security Council resolution, on 27 June (7 to 1, with Yugoslavia opposed, India and Egypt abstaining, and the Soviet Union still absent), called on UN members to provide assistance to South Korea. And on 7 July, after U.S. and ROK forces had come under heavy attack and had been driven southward, the Security Council passed a third resolution in the USSR's absence--7 to 0, with India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia abstaining: it urged all members to contribute forces to a UN Unified Command. U.S. General MacArthur was appointed to lead the combined forces.  The PRC crisis faded in July as events in the area merged with the ongoing Korean War. There was no specific United Nations action concerning the PRC/Taiwan crisis.  The Soviet attitude and role are now known. After almost a year of hesitation, according to official USSR documents, Stalin gave Kim Il-Sung a "green light" to launch a full-scale attack on South Korea: first, in a message to the Korean leader on 30 January 1950, via the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang--"tell him that I am ready to help him in this matter [a large matter in regard to South Korea such as he wants to undertake]"; and second, during a meeting with Kim in Moscow in April 1950. Thereafter Soviet military advisors were sent to North Korea to help plan the campaign, along with a large amount of weapons and supplies. The Soviet Union also provided air cover over North Korean cities. Kim Il-Sung also secured the support of Mao Tse-tung at a meeting in Beijing in May.  By 29 September 1950 UN forces had restored control of South Korea to the Rhee government, and the crisis ended for South Korea and the United States. The following day the crisis ended for Taiwan with the reduction of intensity of the conflict.
A second, closely related international crisis during the Korean War lasted from 30 September 1950 to 10 July 1951. The crisis actors were North Korea, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and South Korea. In August 1950 the PRC warned the United Nations that it would retaliate if U.S. or ROK forces crossed the 38th Parallel. On 29 September the UN forces handed control of South Korea back to the civilian government headed by Syngman Rhee. On 30 September the Third Division of the ROK army crossed the 38th Parallel and advanced rapidly, triggering a crisis for North Korea. This threat was accentuated on 1 October by MacArthur's ultimatum to the DPRK demanding unconditional surrender. The same day Kim Il-Sung, the ruler of North Korea, appealed to Beijing for immediate military intervention to save his regime.  These three events triggered a crisis for the PRC, as evident in a secret decision by the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo on 2 October to dispatch "Chinese Volunteers" to assist North Korea. The decision was taken under pressure from Stalin--but only after the PRC's leaders perceived a serious threat to the security of China and to the very existence of the DPRK. The crossing of the 38th Parallel by U.S. forces on 7 October escalated the stress level in Beijing--and triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. Mao issued the formal order to enter the Korean War on the 8th; but the PRC's military intervention, its major response to this crisis, did not occur until 19 October, after lengthy--and disappointing--consultations with Stalin. In response to Mao's telegram on the 2nd, conveying the decision to send "Chinese Volunteers" and warning of possible U.S. military retaliation against the PRC, Stalin initially pledged to dispatch fighters and bombers to North Korea. However, on the 9th, at a meeting with Zhou Enlai in Moscow, just two days after the direct entry of U.S. forces into North Korea, Stalin reneged: the USSR's major response, that day, was to promise military equipment for 20 PRC divisions engaged in the Korean War and to place its forces both in the Soviet Far East and in Manchuria on alert, pending further penetration by U.S. forces in the DPRK, which might bring U.S. troops closer to the Soviet border.  News of the crossing of the Yalu River by thousands of "Chinese Volunteers," initiated in secrecy, reached Washington in late October. Fighting between those forces and UN forces at the Battle of Unsan, triggering a crisis for the United States on 25 October 1950. By late November the Chinese had begun successful major attacks against UN forces. The U.S. response, on 30 November, was a statement by President Truman announcing that the United States was prepared to use whatever weapons it had in its arsenal to defeat the Chinese troops.  PRC and North Korean forces recrossed the 38th Parallel on 26 December 1950. That, along with heavy fighting in Seoul, triggered a crisis for South Korea. On 3 January 1951 UN and South Korean forces abandoned the capital, which was captured the following day. The reversal of the tide of battle terminated the crisis for the Soviet Union. Differences between President Truman and General MacArthur over the expansion of the war led to MacArthur's dismissal in the early spring of 1951. The UN forces recaptured Seoul on 14 March 1951. There was a PRC counterattack in late April, but by June the fighting stabilized around the 38th Parallel. A cease-fire and armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951, ending the crisis for North and South Korea, the PRC, and the U.S.  The USSR's use of its great power veto had effectively blocked UN Security Council action during this crisis and, therefore, the General Assembly became increasingly involved. On 7 October 1950 the Assembly created the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK). When the Security Council was unable to do so, a new resolution, the Uniting for Peace Resolution, was passed on 3 November, granting the General Assembly authority to take action on threats to peace and security when the Security Council was unable to fulfill this responsibility, a crucial element in the UN Charter. In December the Assembly created the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA) and a three-person group on a cease-fire. And on 1 February 1951 a resolution was passed by the General Assembly declaring the PRC to be an aggressor and demanding the withdrawal of its forces from Korea.
Syria and Israel were enmeshed in a crisis over the Hula Valley in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between them from 12 February to 15 May 1951. This was the first Arab/Israel interstate crisis since the end of the 1948-49 war. Its origins lay in a continuing dispute over control of the sources of the Jordan River and rights in the "No-Man's Land" on the Israel/Syrian border. A crisis for Syria was triggered on 12 February 1951, the day Israel's Palestine Land Development Company (PLDC) began work on the Hula drainage project in the DMZ north of Lake Tiberias (the Kinneret, Sea of Galilee). Its goals were to drain the lake and surrounding marshes, eliminate malaria in the area, reclaim 6,250 hectares (about 15,000 acres) of land for agriculture, and use the accumulated water to irrigate other parts of Israel.  Syria contended that Israel's project violated their 1949 Armistice Agreement, under which the DMZ was a no-man's land. It also perceived a threat from an adverse change in the balance of power with its enemy if the Hula Valley became an economically productive area under de facto Israeli control. On the 14th Damascus appealed to the UN Security Council to compel Israel to halt the project. Israel refused to do so, citing the concession granted to the PLDC by the British Mandatory Power in 1934 and claiming that the land fell under its jurisdiction according to Mandate maps. Syria countered with a claim to the town of al-Hamma and all territory in the DMZ east of the southern part of Lake Tiberias. On 15 March Arabs in civilian dress opened fire on a bulldozer of the Israeli company working in the Hula area. This triggered a crisis for Israel, which charged that they were Syrian soldiers, while Syria disclaimed responsibility for the acts of "Arab landowners." The next day Israel informed the UN Mixed Armistice Commission (MAC) that it would suspend operations in the Hula Valley for a week. Discussions in the MAC were deadlocked, with intermittent firing incidents.  Tension escalated dramatically on 4 April, when Syrian soldiers killed seven Israeli policemen near al-Hamma, in the southern part of the DMZ. Israel retaliated the next day with an air attack on the Syrian outpost and the police station of al-Hamma. Both sides appealed to the Security Council, blaming each other for a violation of their Armistice Agreement. Two Syrian planes were shot down on the 11th.  While Security Council deliberations were taking place, a further sharp escalation occurred early in May. On the 2nd Syrian forces overran the Israeli post at Tel al-Mutillah, just beyond the DMZ. After several counterattacks from 3 to 6 May and heavy casualties--40 Israelis and more Syrians--Israeli troops regained control of Tel al-Mutillah.  The Security Council passed a resolution on 8 May calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of military forces from the DMZ. Hostilities ended on the 11th, following an agreement mediated by the MAC that day. It was formalized on the 15th, terminating the Hula Drainage crisis.  The UN and its MAC played a crucial role in abating the crisis, as noted, through mediation and the Security Council resolution. MAC mediation began on 21 February and was met with initial difficulty because Israel refused to accept the legitimacy of MAC involvement. However, the 15 May agreement was ultimately a result of successful MAC mediation efforts. The Council did not assign responsibility for the incidents on the ground, including the killing of the Israeli policemen, but criticized Israel's use of air power in the DMZ. Both the U.S. and the USSR were politically involved but had only a marginal effect on crisis abatement.  (On the larger issue of the Hula Drainage dispute, another Security Council resolution, on 18 May, adopted a pro-Syria stance: it ordered the PLDC to cease operations in the DMZ until the chairman of the Israel/Syria MAC arranged an agreement to resume the project. Israel agreed on 30 May to stop work, except on Jewish-owned land in the area, a compromise approved by the MAC chairman, but not by Syria.)
Another crisis for India and Pakistan began on 7 July 1951 and ended the following month. Protests against a number of alleged Pakistani violations of the Kashmir Cease-fire Agreement of 1 January 1949 (see Case #119) were made to the UN Security Council by India in the latter half of June 1951. In a letter on 25 June it was stated that the Indian government saw the incidents as being "very grave," especially when "coupled with the fanatical war propaganda that is daily growing in volume in Pakistan which justify the suspicion that they are part of a planned program calculated to lead, if unchecked, to an outbreak of hostilities between the two countries." The Pakistani minister of Kashmir affairs maintained that there was nothing new or extraordinary in the incidents mentioned by India. India's crisis was triggered on 7 July 1951 when Pakistan moved a brigade to within 15 miles of the Kashmir district of Poonch. These military movements, along with the perception of talk of jihad (holy war) and the growing evidence of political instability in Pakistan, led Prime Minister Nehru to respond on 10 July with an order to move Indian troops to the Punjab border and to Jammu and Kashmir. Leaves for Indian army officers were canceled. Nehru's response constituted the trigger to Pakistan's crisis.  Acting upon advice by Pakistan's Chief of Staff, General Ayub Khan, that Pakistan was unprepared for war, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan decided to attempt to manage the crisis through diplomatic channels. His major response, on 15 July, was to inform a press conference that the heavy concentration of Indian troops was within easy striking distance of Pakistan's borders. He requested that Nehru remove the threat and added that Pakistan "would not allow itself to be intimidated or influenced by any threat of force." In addition, on 27 July, four battalions of the Pakistan National Guard were sent to reinforce the Pakistani army on the border. Prolonged correspondence between Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan took place from 15 July throughout August.  The crisis wound down sometime in August when the withdrawal of forces by both armies began. Violence was not employed by either country.  U.S. activity was limited to an expression of concern, and there was no Soviet activity. Prior to the onset of crisis, Dr. Frank Graham, the UN Representative for India and Pakistan, began conversations in New Delhi and then in Srinager and Azad, Kashmir. This began a line of communication via telegrams between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. During the mediation, charges and counter charges over the others’ intentions were exchanged. Graham stayed and mediated beyond the end of crisis. His mediation efforts had no effect on crisis abatement.
This crisis lasted from 30 July 1951 to 30 January 1952 and involved two crisis actors, Egypt and the United Kingdom. At the end of World War II Egypt had demanded the abrogation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian treaty on the Suez Canal and its unification with Sudan. When Britain promised self-determination to Sudan, Egypt's relations with the U.K. worsened, and talks between the two countries to renew the treaty allowing a British presence in the Canal Zone ran into difficulties. A shift toward radicalization in Egypt's political life occurred. On 30 July 1951 a crisis was triggered for Egypt by the U.K.'s reaffirmation of its rights to the Canal under the 1936 treaty and a call for U.S. support. Cairo viewed this as an implied threat of force and an explicit threat to Egypt's sovereignty over the Canal Zone. Egypt's response, on 8 October 1951, which triggered a crisis for the U.K., was a draft proposal to the Egyptian parliament calling for the abrogation of the treaty and demanding British evacuation of the Suez Canal Zone. The U.K. responded on 16 October by declaring a state of emergency for its forces in Egypt and a decision to reinforce troops in the Canal Zone, as well as to prohibit the export of arms to Egypt. Attempts to force the evacuation of British troops by a popular resistance movement caused prolonged and serious clashes. Guerrilla warfare in Egypt against the British continued for some time until the country was in near-total disorder. Egypt's crisis ended on 27 January 1952 when King Farouk appointed a new government. The crisis for the U.K. ended on 30 January when the Egyptian prime minister called upon the British ambassador and agreed to resume talks.  The United States strongly supported the British position. The USSR was not involved. Egypt appealed to the UN in November 1951, and an inquiry committee was set up. (On 18 February 1952, subsequent to the crisis, a report was published that denied Egyptian allegations of Britain's use of forced labor to build its bases in Egypt.) The Political Committee of the Arab League passed a resolution on 3 September 1951 expressing full support for Egypt.
The crisis for Sweden began on 16 June 1952. The exact termination date is unknown but was probably sometime in July 1952. Sweden, separated from the USSR by Finland and the Baltic Sea, maintained its neutrality during the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939 (see Case #76--Finnish War, in Finland/Russia PC) and during World War II.  Swedish-Soviet relations after 1945 were cautious, but correct. In February 1952 a spy ring working in the service of the USSR was uncovered in Sweden. On 16 June 1952 two Soviet fighters shot down a Swedish Catalina flying boat that was taking part in a search for a Swedish training plane that had disappeared with its crew of eight men three days earlier. In response, Sweden placed its army on alert on the 18th. An exchange of Notes between the two countries followed. On 19 June several members of the Soviet embassy in Stockholm left Sweden to return to Moscow. The following day the Swedish foreign minister interrupted a visit to Italy to return home. There was no precise termination date: it was determined as sometime in July after the fourth and last Note relating directly to the crisis was sent by Sweden. There was no reply from the USSR, implying a tacit understanding to let the matter drop.  The incident was condemned by the United States in a statement by Secretary of State Dean Acheson.  There was no UN involvement.
A crisis for Burma over Chinese Nationalist troops on its territory occurred between 8 February 1953 and 15 October 1954. In 1949 Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese Nationalist) forces, who had retreated to southern China during the China Civil War (see Case #125, in Taiwan Strait PC), crossed into Burma as the Chinese Communists consolidated their position in the south. KMT forces, commanded by General Li Mi, occupied part of the Burmese state of Kengtung, which adjoined China and Thailand, and became an intolerable nuisance to Burma because of their alliance with, and supply of arms to, the local insurgents. They also served as a possible provocation for a Chinese Communist incursion into Burmese territory and drew 12,000 Chinese forces into an uncomfortable proximity to the border. By 1952 air drops and supplies from foreign air bases became frequent and blatant. On 8 February 1953 a crisis was triggered for Burma when local insurgents combined with 300 KMT troops to attack Loikaw, the capital of the state of Kayah. Additional attacks occurred on the 11th and 27th at other Burmese locations. Documents showed that the intention of the KMT was to overthrow the Union of Burma government. Burma contended that the KMT forces were being supplied by Nationalist-held Taiwan, with tacit U.S. agreement. Prime Minister U Nu responded to the threat to his regime with a statement on 2 March that his government intended to take the KMT question to the United Nations. On 17 March Burma notified the United States that their assistance agreements would be terminated by June. This step was taken so that the government would not be accused of complacency on the KMT issue due to its obligations to Washington.  Burma submitted a complaint to the Secretary-General of the UN on the 25th, and on the 31st requested that it be placed on the General Assembly agenda for debate. A resolution was introduced on 17 April condemning the Nationalist Chinese government and indicating necessary steps to disarm and withdraw the KMT troops from Burma. On the 21st the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the presence of foreign troops in Burma and insisting upon their withdrawal. The U.S. proposed a conference with Burma, Nationalist China, and Thailand to discuss the withdrawal of the KMT forces.  A four-nation Joint Military Commission under UN auspices was formed and met on 22 May 1953. Negotiations, as well as serious clashes between Burma and KMT troops, continued throughout the summer. Burma withdrew from the talks on 17 September. Despite the attempts at mediation throughout the crisis – conducted under the auspices of the UN and including formulation on the part of the US – Burma found the results unsatisfactory and ultimately resolved the issue on its own. Eventually 7,000 KMT troops were airlifted to Nationalist China between November 1953 and May 1954. On 30 May General Li Mi announced the formal dissolution of his Yunnan anti-communist army and, on 30 July, the Joint Military Commission announced in Burma that its program had been completed. About 6,000 guerrillas remained in Burma.  Burma submitted a new request to the UN Secretary-General on 20 August, and on the 29th of September a report on the situation was submitted to the UN stating that Burma viewed the continued presence of Chinese Nationalist troops in its territory as a threat. On 15 October 1954 Burma's representative acknowledged that the partial removal of KMT troops "represented the limit of what could be accomplished by international action." The crisis terminated that day with a Burmese statement that the removal of foreign troops from its territory would be its responsibility alone.  The USSR was not involved.  (KMT troops, with U.S. and Taiwan aid, continued their operations in Burma until 1961 when they were finally driven into Thailand and Laos by the Burmese army.)
The crisis began on 24 March 1953 and faded, with no specific termination date. The two actors were France and Laos. The invasion of Laos occurred during the first Indochina long war, which had begun after the restoration of French control following World War II. Within Laos there were communist-oriented guerrilla groups, the Pathet Lao, which cooperated with the Vietminh guerrillas of Vietnam. The northern frontier of Laos was occupied by Vietminh forces in December 1952; and, for the next three months, they massed along the border. By mid-March 1953 their strength had grown to four divisions. The crisis trigger for France can be dated 24 March when the massing of Vietminh troops in Laos reached its peak. The trigger for Laos was the launching of a Vietminh offensive on 5 April. The French responded on 13 April by evacuating the first major town along the Laos border. The same day Laos ordered a general mobilization and appealed to the UN to halt the invasion. On the 27th Prince Souphanouvong declared the formation of a "Free Laotian Government." Vietminh forces surrounded the airfield and the fortified camp on the Plaine des Jarres and advanced toward the two Laotian capitals of Vientiane (administrative) and Luang Prabang (royal). French-Laotian troops, supplied by an extensive airlift from Saigon, clashed with the Vietminh at Sam-heva. The widely dispersed Vietminh garrisons began withdrawing to North Vietnam by mid-May, leaving behind Laotian guerrilla forces. The French proceeded to recapture the abandoned position. On 2 June two columns of French-Laotian forces advancing north and south reestablished contact between the provinces of Vientiane and Xiengkhouang. Fighting erupted and subsided and finally led to the Navarre military plan and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu the following year (see Case #145), with no precise termination date for this crisis.  There was no UN or USSR involvement. The only regional organization activity was a communiqué on 25 April by NATO citing the invasion of Laos as an example of continuing communist aggression.
The third crisis during the Korean War began on 16 April and ended on 27 July 1953. The crisis actors were the U.S., China, North Korea, and South Korea. In January 1953 Eisenhower succeeded Truman in the White House. Primary U.S. concerns in Korea were the release of the prisoners of war and an end to the stalemate. On 2 February President Eisenhower mentioned the possibility of removing the Seventh Fleet from the Taiwan Strait: it had been serving as an effective barrier to Chinese Nationalist (Taiwan) plans to invade the mainland. In addition, Stalin's death on 5 March left a power vacuum in the USSR, the PRC's closest ally during this period. Armistice and prisoner of war (POW) negotiations at Panmunjom continued with little progress, as a reported 46,000 PRC and North Korean prisoners in South Korea stated that they did not wish to return to their homelands. While the communist powers demanded their return, the UN sought ways not to force them to do so. On 16 April 1953 the PRC-North Korean forces began a new offensive against UN troops at Pork Chop Hill and Old Baldy. In the setting of the political discussions at Panmunjom and the general lull in the fighting, this new attack catalyzed an intrawar crisis for the United States. Washington responded on 22 May when Secretary of State Dulles threatened the PRC, via India's Prime Minister Nehru, with the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons to break the deadlock in Korea. This triggered a fresh crisis for the PRC and North Korea. Their combined response, on 8 June, was an agreement at Panmunjom for the voluntary repatriation of POWs, which broke the political deadlock. The softening of the communist position, on 8 June, triggered a crisis for South Korea which, fearing a U.S. withdrawal, viewed any agreement on the POW issue as a compromise of its reunification plans for the Korean peninsula. The South Korean response, on 18 June, was the unauthorized release of about 25,000 prisoners of war who had declared their preference not to return to the PRC or North Korea. This act, while angering the U.S., did not succeed in halting the negotiating process. An Armistice Agreement was signed on 27 July 1953 terminating the crisis for all four actors.  The agreement established a demarcation line in Korea, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a Military Armistice Committee (MAC) to resolve violations of the agreement, and a commission to supervise troop withdrawals.  The USSR was not involved in this crisis.  (There were many violations of the Armistice Agreement over the years, including an estimated 700 minor armed incidents in the DMZ. The most recent occurred in early April 1996, when 300 heavily armed DPRK troops entered the DMZ at Panmunjom--the agreement permitted the entry of only 35 lightly armed soldiers from each side. North Korea's motive was unclear but seemed to be aimed at pressure on Washington to negotiate a formal bilateral peace agreement between the U.S. and the DPRK, excluding the ROK [South Korea], to replace the 43-year-old Armistice Agreement. The abortive crisis, which occurred days before elections to South Korea's National Assembly, faded after three days.)
A crisis for the Soviet Union over East German riots began on 17 June and terminated on 11 July 1953. The East German uprising in 1953 can be traced to a hard-line decision of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) on 12 July 1952, calling for "the Construction of Socialism" in East Germany (the DDR): higher taxes; priority to heavy industry; collectivization of agriculture; hostility to the churches; and remilitarization. Dissent grew steadily.  Following Stalin's death in March 1953, greater attention was devoted to consumer goods by the USSR, and the DDR's Walter Ulbricht was advised to follow suit. Nevertheless, on 28 May 1953 an increased production quota system was introduced in East Germany. This prompted a strike by construction workers on 16 June, a spontaneous demonstration directed against the ruling party on strictly economic grounds. Toward the end of the day, although the government had agreed to roll back the new quotas, a general strike was called for the following day. On 17 June 1953 workers went on strike and marched in East Berlin and 400 other towns in the DDR. Economic grievances took on political overtones, while throngs of people rioted. This triggered an external crisis for the USSR (as well as a major domestic crisis for East Germany). A state of emergency was declared in the DDR, and martial law was introduced. Moscow's response, the same day, was to send tanks and Soviet troops stationed in bases inside the DDR to East Berlin where they were supported by East German paramilitary police. These forces succeeded in quelling the rebellion, after 125 died and thousands were arrested.  The Soviets perceived these riots as a dangerous precedent--as it was to be for the Hungarian Uprising in 1956-57 (see Case #155) and a threat to their East European bloc. On 11 July martial law was lifted in the DDR, ending Moscow's crisis. It also put the official seal on a gradual process that led to the reduction of the Soviet presence. The Western powers limited themselves to psychological warfare, especially via the Radio in the American Sector (RIFS), and diplomatic notes on the need to cease hostilities, as well as urging German reunification.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
There were two crisis actors in the second international crisis over Trieste--Yugoslavia and Italy. It began on 8 October and ended on 5 December 1953. On 8 October 1953 Britain and the United States announced their intention to terminate the Allied Military Government in Trieste, to withdraw their troops, and to relinquish the administration to the Italian government. This triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia, which responded two days later by lodging a formal protest with London and Washington and informing the UN. The frontier was closed, Yugoslav military reserves were called up, and warships were moved into the area. Those acts on the 10th triggered Italy's crisis. Italy's major response, on 17 October, was to place three divisions at the Yugoslav frontier on emergency posting.  The decision by the U.K. and U.S. to evacuate Trieste was postponed while diplomatic efforts continued to convene a conference. On 5 December 1953 an agreement was announced in Rome and Belgrade for the simultaneous withdrawal of Italian and Yugoslav forces from the border. This ended the crisis for both actors.  During the crisis, delegations from the US and UK attempted to mediate between the Yugoslav and Italian antagonists. They used various styles of mediation, which included meeting with each side separately and then trying to reach a mutually acceptable compromise based on those meetings. Ultimately, the mediation strongly contributed to bringing about a resolution to the conflict.  (The political outcome of the dispute took the form of a Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 5 October 1954 by the U.S., the U.K., Italy, and Yugoslavia, which granted the northern zone to Italy and the southern zone to Yugoslavia.)
There was one crisis actor--Jordan. The crisis was triggered on 14 October 1953. It had no exact termination date. After the Arab/Israel War of 1948-49 (see Case #120), Arab refugees who had fled Palestine were placed in camps in Jordan where anti-Israel sentiments flourished. Infiltrations from Jordan into Israel began in 1951. In October 1953 the situation was exacerbated when Jordanian infiltrators murdered an Israeli woman and her two children. On 14 October 1953 a Jordan crisis was triggered when the Israel Defense Forces retaliated against the village of Qibya in Jordan, killing 69 civilians and destroying 45 houses. Jordan responded on the 16th by conferring with the U.S. and Britain, lodging a complaint with the Security Council, and calling for a meeting of the Arab League. This resulted in condemnation of Israel by both forums. Israel public opinion prompted its leaders to decide to refrain from attacks on civilian targets in the future. Infiltrations stopped for a while but were resumed after a few months.  The U.S. was involved politically, with little effect on the substance or timing of the outcome. The USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
Guatemala, the United States, and Honduras were engaged in a crisis with a pronounced Cold War dimension from 12 December 1953 until 29 June 1954. Agrarian reform and foreign investment control were instituted in Guatemala in 1951, with growing influence of the Communist Party. The U.S. perceived this development as a threat to its influence in Latin America. The Guatemala crisis was triggered on 12 December 1953 when Guatemala's government received information concerning a U.S. decision to support an antigovernment "liberation" movement. The following month Guatemala responded with a decision to obtain arms from the Soviet bloc in order to arm a workers' militia. This information, confirmed to the U.S. on 10 February 1954, triggered a crisis for the U.S. Soviet arms began reaching Guatemala on 15 May and were viewed by the U.S. as a grave development. On 18 May Honduras, in the midst of a general strike causing substantial damage to its economy, perceived Guatemalan infiltration, along with rumors about arms reaching Honduran strikers via Guatemala, as a threat. Honduras responded on 25 May by recalling its ambassador to Guatemala.  After unsuccessful efforts by the U.S. to resolve the situation through conferences, negotiations, and promises to review Latin American economic problems, its major response occurred on 18 June when the U.S. proclaimed a complete embargo on arms shipments to Guatemala and backed an invasion led by Castillo Armas against the Arbenz government, then in power in Guatemala. Guatemala appealed to the Security Council and the Inter-American Peace Committee the next day for assistance, accusing Honduras (and Nicaragua) of aggression. On the 20th, the Soviets vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for no UN intervention until an investigation had been completed by the Organization of American States (OAS). When the Guatemalan army refused to engage the Armas forces, Arbenz resigned, on 27 June. After an interim Diaz-led military junta stayed in control for two days, a new junta, led by Colonel Morzón, was set up on 29 June 1954 and suppressed the "Arbencista" political elite. This marked the termination date for all three crisis actors.  (The U.S.'s CIA-initiated Guatemala crisis and the overthrow of the Arbenz regime led to the longest internal war in Latin America's history. It began in 1961 and led to the death of more than 100,000--some estimates are as high as 200,000. After 35 years of civil strife, the armed forces and left-wing guerrillas signed a peace accord on 19 September 1996. This was the fifth major pact brokered by the U.N. since January 1994: the others dealt with human rights, poverty, land tenure, and war crimes. The military accord provided for a substantial reduction in the size, budget, and power of the armed forces, including the creation of a new, civilian-directed police force to take over the army's long-standing control over internal security.)  (In December 1996 the Guatemalan Government and the left-wing guerrilla coalition terminated their struggle with three pacts: a "definitive cease-fire"; an agreement on constitutional reforms and electoral procedures; and the process for reintegrating the guerrillas into Guatemalan society. The overarching peace accord was signed in Guatemala City on 29 December 1996.)
The crisis over Dien Bien Phu for France, the U.S., and the U.K. lasted from 13 March to 21 July 1954. France's strategy in the first Indochina War (1946-54) changed in early 1953 when a new commander, Henri Navarre, arrived in its Southeast Asia colony. Laos had been invaded by the communist-led Vietminh (see Case #139--Invasion of Laos I); and the French sought proof of their ability to remain in Indochina before the scheduled May 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina. The new strategy consisted of regrouping and reinforcing local forces and areas held by the French and opening areas held by the Vietminh. This plan was not successful.  Dien Bien Phu lay in a flat valley surrounded by Vietminh-occupied hills on the entrance road to Laos and at the crossroads of three other roads. Throughout the winter of 1953-54 the French fortified the area. The plan was to draw the Vietminh forces to Dien Bien Phu for a showdown battle. Both forces underestimated the strength of their adversary. On 13 March 1954 the Vietminh launched their first major offensive against Dien Bien Phu, triggering a crisis for France. By 17-18 March the surrounding French defensive positions had been taken. France's major response, on the 20th, was an appeal to its allies for increased aid and the threat of strong military action, to be used as a bargaining chip in an anticipated negotiated settlement. This appeal--the call for direct and immediate U.S. involvement in the war--triggered a crisis for the United States.  French General Ely met with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff on 21 and 24 March and with President Eisenhower on the 22nd. Matters involving the supply of U.S. bombers and ground strategy were discussed. The U.S.'s initial response on 29 March took the form of a speech by Secretary of State Dulles, stressing the vital importance of Indochina to U.S. security; and he proposed that the U.S. and its allies meet the communist threat with undefined "united action." The next day the second Vietminh offensive began.  Strategy discussions were held by the U.S. Joint Chiefs from 29 March to 3 April. A plan, "Operation Vulture," was proposed by Admiral Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for limited tactical nuclear air strikes against Vietminh positions around Dien Bien Phu by the Seventh Fleet then positioned in the Philippines. The U.S. president rejected this proposal. The need to strengthen France's will to fight was emphasized. There was also a plan to dispatch seven armored divisions--contingent upon the U.S. being allowed to train the South Vietnamese forces. This did not appeal to either France or the U.K.  The U.K.'s crisis was triggered on 11 April by Dulles's arrival in London, posing a threat of pressure for direct British participation in the Indochina War. The same day another Vietminh attack brought its forces within a quarter of a mile of the French stronghold, cutting off the use of its airstrip and preventing the evacuation of the wounded, as well as the arrival of supplies. In London Dulles reiterated that his plan for united action was not designed to prejudice the upcoming Geneva talks on Indochina, scheduled to begin on 8 May. On 13 April Dulles and Prime Minister Eden issued a statement referring to a regional collective defense arrangement, under the UN Charter, which would be considered at the Geneva Conference. A similar U.S.-France statement was issued the next day.  On 21 April General Navarre informed Paris that Dien Bien Phu could not hold out unless there were allied air attacks on Vietminh supply routes. Dulles, in Paris for a NATO meeting, met with Eden and heard Prime Minister-Foreign Minister Bidault's request for air strikes. The U.S. refused to act without U.K. cooperation, which Eden would not grant. U.S. aid was formally requested by France on 25 April. A plan was formulated by Dulles and the French ambassador to London to push for a U.K. decision.  An emergency British cabinet meeting ended with a decision that the U.K. would not join in any "precipitate military intervention" in Indochina before the Geneva Conference, along with a promise to consider a collective defense scheme in the area after the conference. On 26 April Eisenhower stated that, in view of the absence of a joint Allied response, the U.S. would not send ground forces, and no unilateral action would be taken. The U.K.'s crisis ended on 27 April with a speech by Prime Minister Churchill to the House of Commons announcing the nonintervention decision. Eisenhower made a similar statement on the 29th.  On 7 May Dien Bien Phu fell. The following day a formal cease-fire took effect; and the U.S. crisis ended. The crisis for France persisted until the signing of a bilateral armistice agreement with the Vietminh: a final declaration, on 21 July 1954, provided for the partition of Vietnam into north and south, along with a call for elections and unification two years later. This resolution came after much negotiation at the Geneva Conference -- the Indochina section of the conference began on 8 May. Molotov, Russia’s representative to the conference, put forth a five-point peace plan, suggested that Vietnam be split at the 17th parallel, and recommended that national elections be held in two years. In addition to the Russian proposals, the Chinese delegation proposed to include Canada, Poland and India as part of an international supervisory committee over Indochina. All of these proposals were accepted.  A regional collective defense arrangement, first considered at the beginning of April 1954, became the basis for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). The UN was not involved in this intrawar crisis.
There were three crisis actors in the first international crisis over the Taiwan Strait: the People's Republic of China (PRC), Nationalist China (Republic of China [ROC] or Taiwan), and the United States. The crisis began in early August 1954 and ended on 23 April 1955. The conflict over the Taiwan Strait began in 1949 after the Communist victory in China's civil war and the split between the PRC and the Nationalists on Taiwan (see Case #125). Neither side was content with this arrangement: each aimed at reunification, with the PRC advocating a Communist regime while Chiang Kai-shek wished to see the Mao Tse-tung-led government removed from the mainland. A crisis for the PRC was triggered in early August 1954 by fear of the impending creation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). It was formally established on 8 September. Zhou Enlai denounced SEATO in a speech on 11 August in which he emphasized the justice of any Communist attempt to reunify China. On 3 September 1954 the PRC bombarded the Nationalist-held offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu. This triggered a crisis for the United States and Taiwan. Nationalist China's response, on 7 September, took the form of air strikes against the Chinese mainland. On the 12th the U.S. responded by deciding to send the Seventh Fleet to the area and appealing to the UN. On 2 December 1954 a defense treaty was signed between the U.S. and Taiwan, by which time the PRC had ceased the bombardment, ending Taiwan's first crisis.  The signing of a U.S.-Taiwan Defense Pact on 2 December 1954 escalated the crisis for the PRC. Its response, on 10 January 1955, was heavy bombardment of the Tachen Islands. This, in turn, triggered a second crisis for Taiwan. The latter responded some time in January 1955 by returning fire and staging battles on the three islands of Tachen, Quemoy, and Matsu. Taiwan subsequently evacuated the Tachen Islands. The U.S. responded to the escalation of the crisis with a request by President Eisenhower to Congress on 24 January to grant him a free hand in controlling the situation in the Taiwan area. The termination of Taiwan's second crisis occurred on 25 March 1955, after completion of the fortification of Quemoy and Matsu, with U.S. help. The crisis for the U.S. and the PRC ended on 23 April 1955 when Zhou Enlai offered to negotiate in the face of an increasing U.S. commitment and the reduced prospects for a successful PRC invasion. Taiwan did not participate in the talks.  During the course of the first Taiwan Strait crisis there was a shift from the plane of Communist-Nationalist confrontation to primary interaction between the PRC and the U.S. United States strategy was directed at building an alliance network of anti-communist states. The Secretary-General of the UN conducted talks, as did the Security Council, but no resolution was passed; and the UN had no effect on the abatement of the crisis. Although the formation of SEATO was the trigger to the crisis, that regional organization was entirely inactive during the crisis. The USSR was marginally involved during this crisis.  In 1958 the same three states experienced another crisis over the issue of Quemoy and Matsu (see Case #166).
Another crisis for these two Central American neighbors lasted from 8 to 20 January 1955. While Nicaragua had a well-trained army of about 7,500 men, Costa Rican defense was entrusted to the National Police Force. On 8 January 1955 Costa Rican President José Figueres received information that Venezuela had sent a fleet of 10 military transports, fully manned, to Nicaragua. Costa Rica appealed to the OAS, mobilized volunteer reserve troops, and placed its police on standby alert. Three days later about 500 Costa Rican rebels crossed the frontier from Nicaragua and captured a town 30 miles north of the capital city, San José. Costa Rica proclaimed a state of emergency and broke diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.  The OAS Council met in emergency session on 11 January and voted to send a fact-finding mission to Costa Rica. On the 14th the mission reported that there were serious indications that the rebels were being supplied with arms from Nicaragua and that foreign aircraft had flown over Costa Rica, strafing and bombing cities. The Council then called upon Nicaragua to stop the flow of arms to the rebels and voted to send observers to the area. The Council decided further, on 16 January, to grant Costa Rica's request for aircraft. Four F-51 Mustang fighter-planes were delivered from the United States. This triggered a crisis for Nicaragua.  President Somoza responded on the 19th by reinforcing Nicaragua's borders and stepping up military flights. Costa Rican forces drove the rebels from the captured territory and forced them back across the Nicaraguan border.  The OAS approved an on-the-spot investigating committee – providing fact finding and observation flights – with which both crisis actors agreed to cooperate. The crisis ended on 20 January 1955 when the Costa Rican rebels withdrew and both states agreed to an OAS plan for demilitarized zones along the border. After the termination of the crisis, the OAS committee helped draft two bilateral treaties that Nicaragua and Costa Rica signed. Whereas Figueres considered the outcome a victory for Costa Rica and credited the OAS and the United States, Nicaragua's Somoza was disappointed that the attempt to overthrow Figueres had failed.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
Egypt's crisis over the Baghdad Pact began on 24 February and ended in mid-October 1955. In February 1954 a Syrian army coup, with Iraqi involvement, ousted a pro-Egyptian regime in Damascus headed by Adib Shishakli. However, Iraqi hopes for a pro-Western Syria were not realized. An agreement between Turkey and Pakistan and bilateral military aid agreements between the U.S., Turkey, and Iraq were signed in April 1954. The United States and Pakistan signed a similar agreement the following month. Iraq announced its intention to join a pro-Western alliance and endeavored to prevent possible isolation in the Arab world by attempting to persuade other Arab states to join as well. On 16 January 1955 Egypt called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League, claiming that no member should become party to an agreement with the Western powers and that such a pact would likely undermine Arab sovereignty and independence. Cairo was unsuccessful in its efforts to have Iraq expelled from the Arab League. On 24 February 1955 Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and the U.K. created a regional anti-Soviet defense arrangement known as the Baghdad Pact, triggering a crisis for Egypt: Nasir viewed the Pact as a challenge to his leadership in the Arab world and a direct threat from the U.S. and the U.K. to overthrow his regime. At the end of February Egypt and Syria announced their intention to exclude Iraq from a new Arab alliance with Sa'udi Arabia and Yemen. Egypt's response, on 15 March, was a denunciation of the Pact and an accusation that the West was introducing great power rivalry and the Cold War into the Middle East, thus dividing the Arab world and threatening Egypt with encirclement. Egypt began to forge counteralliances with Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria; and the division of the Arab states into rival camps hardened.  The crisis ended in mid-October 1955 when Egypt and Syria concluded a Mutual Defense Pact. The United States participated in the negotiations and provided economic assistance but never formally joined the Pact. The Soviet Union provided arms and weapons to Egypt and Syria.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.  (In July 1958 a coup in Iraq overthrew the monarchy and established a military dictatorship [see Case #165--Iraq-Lebanon Upheaval]. Iraq subsequently left the Baghdad Pact.)
The crisis between Egypt and Israel began on 28 February 1955 and ended on 23 June 1956. During the early 1950s Israel suffered from repeated terrorist attacks by infiltration into Israeli territory, particularly from Gaza, which was then controlled by Egypt. Five reprisal raids into Egyptian territory were carried out by Israel from 1950 to 1955. Israel's retaliatory raid into Gaza on 28 February 1955, in which 39 Arabs were killed and 32 injured, triggered a crisis for Egypt. On 20 March Egypt appealed to the UN Security Council and the Arab League. Its major response, on 20 April, was a request by Nasir to Zhou Enlai to contact Moscow about supplying arms to Egypt. The crisis ended for Egypt on 28 September 1955 when, with Soviet approval, an arms agreement was signed with Czechoslovakia.  This marked the trigger for Israel's crisis. By 11 December 1955, when an agreement between France and Israel for the purchase of French Mystères was signed, Israel had answered cumulative terrorist attacks by four more raids into Egyptian territory. On 5 April 1956 a large raid into Gaza resulted in 59 deaths and 93 wounded. However, Israel's major response was a letter to the prime minister of France on 12 April 1956 requesting massive amounts of arms. Another agreement was signed for six more French Mystères on 23 April. The termination date for Israel's crisis was 23 June 1956 when a third arms deal was signed with France that would provide substantial French arms to Israel, and enable Israeli decision makers to correct the imbalance in military capability that had occurred as a result of the Czech. arms agreement with Egypt and Syria.  The Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel for the Gaza Raid. The Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, arrived in Jerusalem on 10 April 1956 to mediate in the crisis via shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem, Cairo and Amman. On 19 April, Hammarskjold secured a cease-fire between Israel and Egypt, but the cease-fire only lasted 10 days. Unable to implement another cease-fire, the Secretary-General left the region and was ultimately ineffective in bringing about crisis abatement. The Arab League held discussions but did not pass any resolution.  The U.S. was politically involved in this crisis. The Soviet Union provided military aid to Egypt.
High tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan in the border area was further revived from 27 March to November 1955. This crisis was another stage in the ongoing conflict over Afghanistan's demand for the creation of an independent Pushtu (Pathan) state in territory that, at that time, was under Pakistani control. The crisis began on 27 March when information reached Afghanistan of the Pakistani government's proposal to incorporate the areas of Pushtu-speaking people in the North West Frontier into a unified province of West Pakistan, the "One Unit Scheme." Afghanistan responded with a broadcast by Prime Minister Daoud voicing his government's protest and a formal note protesting the proposed merger. This reached Karachi on 29 March and triggered a crisis for Pakistan. The next day Pakistan's embassy in Kabul was attacked. Pakistan responded on 1 April with a declaration by Prime Minister Mohammed Ali that Pakistan would not tolerate any intervention in its domestic affairs and would not rest until amends were made for the attack on its embassy. Further Pakistani steps were taken on 1 May: the breaking off of diplomatic relations; the closing of the borders; and the termination of economic relations, including the closing down of all Afghan trade agencies in Pakistan. The latter had a severe effect on Afghanistan, which was dependent on Pakistani ports for trade. Afghanistan announced a mobilization and declared a state of emergency. Pakistan dispatched troops to the border. By 9 September the two adversaries reached an agreement whereby Afghanistan promised to make amends for the insult to Pakistan's flag. On 14 October a united West Pakistan was inaugurated, including areas of the North West Frontier Province that bordered Afghanistan. The One Unit Scheme terminated Pakistan's crisis. The diplomatic issue regarding Pakistan's embassy in Afghanistan was solved by a formal reopening in Kabul in November 1955, terminating the crisis for Afghanistan.  The 9 September agreement resulted, in part, from multiple mediation efforts. The first attempt at mediation involved Prince Musaid Din Abdur Rahman from Saudi Arabia, Col. Anwar Sadat from Egypt and La-Sayed Abdul Kadir Al-Gaylani and Ibrahim Al-Rauri, the Iraqi ministers in Karachia and Kabul respectively. The mediation began with the arrival of Rahman in Kabul on 14 May 1955 but was deemed a failure by 6 June. However, a new round of mediated negotiations began in early July that ultimately was influential in facilitating crisis abatement. This second attempt at mediation included delegations from Iran, Iraq and Turkey.  (After diplomatic and economic relations were restored the core issue of independence for the Pushtuns was once more brought to the fore. Although the conflict over Pushtunistan continued, the high level of tension was reduced by reciprocal visits of Pakistan's prime minister and Afghanistan's president in August 1956 when both declared their intentions to improve relations.)  The USSR was marginally involved in this crisis. The U.S. and the UN were not involved.
The first Goa crisis for Portugal began on 10 August and lasted until 6 September 1955. After the British withdrawal from India in 1947 Portugal continued to reject all Indian requests for the reunification of its enclaves on the west coast of India into the Republic of India. This led to the closing of the Indian legation in Lisbon in June 1953.  Intensification of nationalist agitation within India, as well as within Portugal's enclaves, began in mid-1954 and resulted in mass arrests, curfews, and expulsions. In July of that year Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Damao were seized by "Free Goan volunteers." The Indian government refused passage to Portuguese forces to reinstate control over these areas. The mass entry of "volunteers" into Goa in May and June became the symbol of a campaign for the peaceful liberation of Goa. On 10 August 1955 it was announced that, despite Nehru's disapproval, Indian "volunteers" would march into Goa in a peaceful mass invasion on 15 August, India's Independence Day. This announcement triggered a crisis for Portugal, which responded by moving army units to the Indian/Goan border and sending its chief of staff to Goa. Prime Minister Cunha called upon the Indian government to ban the march.  On 15 August about 3,000 Indian demonstrators marched across the Goan border. Portuguese police and soldiers opened fire killing 20 and wounding many more. Lisbon protested to New Delhi on the 17th, accusing it of violating Portugal's sovereignty. India broke diplomatic relations with Portugal on the 19th.  On 4 September the All-India Congress Committee, the legislative body of India's governing Congress Party, declared that in the present situation it would be inappropriate for Indian nationals to enter Goa. This crisis ended on 6 September when Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in parliament that India had no intention of taking any warlike measures over Goa. A second crisis over Goa erupted in 1961 (see Case #190).  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
There were six crisis actors in this two-stage Middle East crisis: France, the U.K., Egypt, the USSR, the U.S., and Israel. The crisis lasted from 26 July 1956 until 12 March 1957. The end of empire with respect to Egypt extended over more than three decades, with three notable events: termination of Britain's protectorate and the formal proclamation of Egypt's independence in February 1922; the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of August 1936, calling for the withdrawal of British forces from Egypt except for 10,000 troops in the Suez Canal Zone--in time of war the number might be increased--and a 20-year alliance; and as a final act the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of October 1954, which provided for the evacuation of all 70,000 British troops from their Suez base within 20 months, that is, by June 1956. On several occasions during the early part of 1956 Egypt had voiced its concern about the continued presence of British forces in the Canal Zone. Cairo had also declared its support for the Algerian Front Liberation National (FLN) in its struggle for independence from France. In the meantime the Egyptian monarchy had been overthrown by the Free Officers in 1952; and Colonel Jamal Abd-ul Nasir had emerged as the dominant political figure in Egypt in 1953. Among his ambitious reform goals was the construction of a massive dam at Aswan to harness the waters of the Upper Nile for irrigation and hydroelectric purposes. The U.S. and the U.K. initially pledged financial support for the Aswan Dam project but withdrew their offer in the spring of 1956 because of Nasir's increasing alignment with the USSR, as evident in the Czech.-Egyptian arms deal of September 1955 (see Case #149), which transformed the arms balance in the Arab/Israel domain.  Israel had been subjected to a steady increase of cross-border infiltrations from Egypt-controlled Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula since 1953. It was even more acutely concerned about the flow of arms to Egypt from Czechoslovakia in 1955-56. On 26 July 1956, "Liberation Day," the fourth anniversary of the military regime, Nasir responded to the Anglo-American volte-face on the Aswan Dam by proclaiming the nationalization of the Suez Canal. A 99-year lease to the Anglo-French Suez Canal Corporation was due to expire in 1968. This dramatic act, perceived in London and Paris as portending grave economic and military consequences, triggered a crisis for the two Western powers. On the 30th multilateral talks were initiated--by the U.K., the U.S., France, and Australia--in order to find a peaceful solution. When these talks, as well as an appeal by Britain and France to the United Nations and three international conferences in the summer of 1956, did not result in satisfaction for the aggrieved parties, France initiated bilateral talks with Israel in August aimed at a military riposte. Britain joined its two allies at a conference at Sèvres held between 22-25 October, where they decided to launch a joint military attack on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.  Crises for Egypt and the USSR were triggered by an Israeli invasion of Sinai, Israel's Sinai Campaign, on 29 October 1956. Two days later British and French forces landed in the Canal Zone. Egypt responded on 30 October with military resistance, a call for general mobilization, and an appeal to the Soviet Union for military and diplomatic assistance. On 5 November Moscow dispatched a harsh Note to the three invading powers and the United States, referring to the "dangerous consequences" of the aggressive war in Egypt, warning that London, Paris, and Tel Aviv lay under the threat of Soviet missiles and indicating the USSR's intention to use force if the situation were not rectified immediately. This escalated the crisis for Britain and France and triggered a crisis for Israel: all three states perceived a threat of grave damage to their urban centers and population at large. The Soviet Note also triggered a crisis for the United States, threatening its allies, its deterrent credibility, and its international influence.  Britain and France complied at once and agreed to a cease-fire, which came into effect the following day, 6 November. They also stated their intention to withdraw all their forces from the Canal Zone. This marked the termination of the Suez crisis for these two states.  The Soviet Note was received in Israel just after its prime minister had broadcast a "victory" speech to parliament, declaring the 1949 armistice lines "null and void." Israel conferred with France, but in the absence of a credible French military commitment against the Soviet threat, it acquiesced. This took the form of a declaration on 8 November that Israel would evacuate Sinai once arrangements for an emergency international peacekeeping force in Sinai had been concluded. This terminated the crisis for the two superpowers.  The process of Israel's withdrawal, with periodic eruptions of high tension, lasted four months. Its crisis--and with it Egypt's crisis and the Suez Nationalization-War crisis as a whole--ended on 12 March 1957 when Israel's withdrawal from Sinai was completed.  The U.S. responded on 6 November by declaring a semialert and indicated that it would not stand by idly if London and Paris were bombed. Tel Aviv was conspicuously omitted from this warning to Moscow. Although countering the Soviet threat, Washington also pressed its allies to withdraw their forces.  The UN, too, was intensely active, culminating in a decision by the General Assembly to send an Emergency Force to police Sinai and Gaza from which all foreign forces were to be withdrawn. NATO, as the regional security organization of the West, was also involved through a strong counterthreat by the NATO Supreme Commander on 13 November 1956.
A crisis for Jordan and Israel took place from 13 September until late October 1956. Infiltration into Israeli territory from neighboring Arab states occurred with increasing frequency during the six years prior to the Sinai Campaign. Acts of reprisal against the Arab state from whose territory infiltrators crossed into Israel were numerous and swift (see Cases #134, #143, and #149). Most recently, during July and August 1956, dozens of Israelis were killed or wounded as a result of several infiltrations of feda'iyyun (guerrilla) groups from Jordan. On 13 September 1956 Israeli forces blew up a police station in the Jordanian village of Garandal. King Hussein's response, the following day, was a decision to visit Iraq to consult Prime Minister Nuri al-Sa'id about the possible stationing of Iraqi troops in Jordan. After several other incidents from Jordan, including the firing on Israeli archaeologists meeting at a border settlement, Israel carried out another reprisal on the Jordanian village of Husan. A third reprisal raid took place on 10 October at Qalqilya in response to a Jordanian ambush of an Israeli bus.  On the 12th Iraq issued a statement that it was ready to send troops to Jordan immediately, if requested to do so. This triggered a crisis for Israel. Foreign Minister Golda Meir responded the next day by declaring that the stationing of Iraqi troops in Jordan would be a threat to Israel's integrity and that in such an event Israel would retaliate. In addition, Israel's ambassadors to the major powers were called home for consultation, and a request was made to convene the UN Security Council.  Israel's crisis ended on 15 October with a Jordanian declaration that Iraqi forces would not enter Jordan at that time but would do so if Israel attacked. The crisis for Jordan faded at the end of October. At that time British planes from Cyprus flew over Jordan in a symbolic gesture to reinforce the Jordan regime which had been undermined by the Qalqilya raid.  The UN Secretary-General met with the representatives of the powers and the two crisis actors and warned of Security Council intervention if peace did not prevail in the area. After the raid on Qalqilya, General Burns, the head of the UN Observer Forces, attempted to stop the fighting but was not successful. The U.S. was involved politically; the USSR was not active.
The USSR and Poland were enmeshed in a crisis from 15 to 22 October 1956. During the summer and autumn of 1956 the Soviet Union faced threats to its hegemonial position in Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary and Poland: economic stagnation was accompanied by increasing demands for greater political freedom internally, as well as more independence from Soviet dictation in foreign policy. On 28 June a demonstration of Polish workers in Poznan turned into a riot that was brutally suppressed by the Polish government, with hundreds killed or wounded. The Polish leadership eventually took decisions that gradually led to the rehabilitation of Wladsylaw Gomulka, a member of the Politburo purged in 1948 for Titoism. Politically, he was one of the few Communist leaders acceptable to the Polish masses. The trigger to the Soviet Union's crisis was Gomulka's return to power on 15 October 1956: he and three allies were invited to rejoin the Politburo of the Polish United Workers Party. The Soviets perceived this dramatic internal shift in power in Poland as a threat to their hegemony. Moscow's response, after the Polish Communist leadership rejected a Khrushchev "invitation" to go to Moscow for a discussion, was a decision on 17 October to send a delegation of Soviet leaders, Khrushchev, Molotov, etc., to attend the PUWP Plenum. When this decision became known in Poland on the 18th, a reciprocal crisis was triggered. Poland's response, the next day, took the form of a threat by Gomulka to broadcast the news that Soviet troops were marching on Warsaw, a fact confirmed by Khrushchev. Such a broadcast could have led to widespread demonstrations. Seven Soviet divisions were put on alert; and patrols along the East German border with Poland were increased. Khrushchev finally relented and ordered a halt to Soviet troop movements when he perceived that the PUWP was in control of the situation and would not allow anti-Soviet demonstrations. Moreover, the veiled threat of the USSR was determined sufficient to keep the Polish leadership within acceptable boundaries.  The crisis over Poland's liberalization ended on 22 October 1956 with the close of the meetings of the Polish Plenum. Khrushchev, now back in Moscow, telephoned his best wishes to Gomulka. The crisis outcome was a compromise. While Gomulka remained in power, the Soviets retained effective control over Poland.  The U.S. was marginally involved in this crisis. The UN was not involved.
Hungary and the USSR were enmeshed in a crisis that began on 23 October 1956 and faded in January 1957. Threats to USSR hegemony in Eastern Europe began to appear in the summer and fall of 1956. A crisis over Poland occurred in October (see Case #154--Poland Liberalization, in Poland/Russia PC). At that time Hungary was ruled by a Soviet-backed government headed by Communist leader Matyas Rakosi. There was growing unrest due to a severe economic situation, lack of democracy, and the aggravating presence of Soviet troops. On 23 October 1956 an estimated 200,000 Hungarian demonstrators, including workers, students, and soldiers, massed in Budapest and other major cities. They called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the return of Imre Nagy to power, progress toward democratization, and the development of Soviet-Hungarian relations on the basis of absolute equality. This was the trigger to the Soviet crisis, a perceived threat to unity in the Soviet bloc. Moscow responded on 1 November with a decision to remove the new government by military action.  A crisis was triggered for Hungary the same day: the Nagy government received reports of massive Soviet armor and tank formations crossing the Hungarian frontier. Hungary responded immediately by announcing its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. A message was also sent to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the issue of Hungarian neutrality be placed before the General Assembly. On 4 November the General Assembly passed a resolution calling for Soviet withdrawal from Hungary; but this had no effect on the Soviet Union's actions or the termination of the crisis.  On 4 November the Soviets removed the Nagy government by force and installed in power a more compliant puppet regime. Nagy was later shot. The Soviet crisis ended on 14 November with the end of Hungarian armed resistance. For Hungary, crisis termination occurred in January 1957, when organized resistance by Hungarian workers was crushed.  The U.S. issued a protest against Soviet interference in Hungary, but acquiesced in the reassertion of Moscow's hegemony in Budapest.
Another crisis over territory between Nicaragua and Honduras lasted from 26 February until 9 May 1957. A second crisis between these Central American neighbors occurred 20 years after their Postage Stamp Crisis (see Case #57). Nicaragua perceived a threat on 26 February 1957 when Honduras began to organize the administration of the disputed area, including some sections over which Nicaragua had been exercising de facto control. On 18 April, after Nicaragua had strengthened its military presence in this area, its troops crossed the Coco River and occupied Mocorón, on the Honduran bank of the river. This triggered a crisis for Honduras, which responded by putting its army on alert and issuing orders to clean up the area around Mocorón. On 1 May the Mocorón area was recaptured by Honduran ground and air forces. Nicaragua's President Somoza ordered general mobilization.  The Council of the OAS met on 2 May to consider a Honduran charge of Nicaraguan aggression and appointed a five-person investigating committee. By the 5th the OAS committee succeeded in getting both parties to sign a cease-fire agreement. However, fighting--and the crisis--continued until 9 May 1957 when both states accepted a truce-cum-troop withdrawal plan, along with the creation of a military Observer Group along the border. While the OAS committee’s mediation effort helped bring about the truce and significantly reduced tensions between the adversaries, it did little in the way of resolving the territorial dispute. The dispute was submitted to the International Court of Justice which, in November 1960, ruled in favor of Honduras.  U.S. activity was channeled through the OAS. The UN and the USSR were not involved.
A crisis over a threat to the regime of King Hussein occurred from 4 April to 3 May 1957. In October 1956 leftist nationalist parties won the parliamentary elections in Jordan, making Suleiman al-Nabulsi Prime Minister. Jordan joined a military alliance with Egypt, Syria, and Sa'udi Arabia. The treaty between the U.K. and Jordan was annulled in March 1957, and diplomatic relations were established with the USSR, which included the acceptance of an offer of Soviet aid. The British commander of Jordan's Arab Legion, Glubb Pasha, was dismissed and was replaced by General Ali Abu Nuwar, who favored closer ties with Nasirist Egypt. His country's increasingly rapid movements toward the Left alarmed King Hussein. The United States became concerned about a possible threat to the independence of Jordan and to the pro-Western regional alliance system established by the Baghdad Pact (see Case #148). The trigger to Jordan's crisis was an attempt on 4 April to overthrow the king. Hussein, perceiving a threat to his regime, accused Egypt and Syria of aiding anti-Hussein elements within Jordan. On 10 April King Hussein responded by dismissing the entire leftist cabinet. Riots and demonstrations followed but were controlled by suppressing all the political parties. Ali Abu Nuwar, the Chief of Staff, was dismissed, and the king succeeded in persuading army officers to support him. The United States, as well as Sa'udi Arabia, came to the king's assistance with military and economic aid. Units of the U.S.'s Sixth Fleet were sent to the eastern Mediterranean, and their departure, on 3 May 1957, indicated that the crisis for the Hashemite Kingdom seemed to have ended.  The Soviet Union covertly supported the anti-Hussein plot. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
Tunisia's three-stage crisis started on 31 May 1957 and ended on 17 June 1958. France, reluctant to give up its position as a colonial power, attempted to retain control over its North African colonies, especially Algeria. Following Tunisia's independence in 1956, France was granted the right to maintain military bases on Tunisian soil. However, Tunisian sympathy for Algeria's struggle for independence created hostile feelings toward the French military presence. Moreover, President Bourguiba saw this as a threat to his regime. France, frustrated by its inability to crush the Algerian Front Liberation National (FLN), accused Tunisia of providing sanctuary for retreating Algerian guerrillas, thus creating further tension between France and Tunisia which erupted in sporadic clashes. The trigger to Tunisia's crisis was a clash on 31 May 1957 between French troops and Tunisian soldiers and National Guards, in which seven Tunisians were killed. This took place on the Algerian-Tunisian frontier where about 2,000 Algerian refugees had crossed into Tunisia. Tunisia responded the next day by issuing a strong protest to France, along with a call for negotiations concerning the evacuation of French forces from Tunisia and an order forbidding the movement of French troops without the Tunisian government's authority.  Negotiations between France and Tunisia led to an announcement on 27 June that approximately 10,000 of the 25,000 French troops stationed there would be transferred to Algeria during the following six months, with the remainder confined to military bases. This marked the end of the first stage of this crisis.  The outcome was unsatisfactory to both sides, and the tension between them remained high.  The second stage began on 8 February 1958, when French medium-range bombers attacked the Tunisian town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef along the Tunisian-Algerian border, killing 69 Tunisians. Although this action was not authorized by Paris, the French government defended it as a legitimate retaliation for Tunisia's assistance to Algerian FLN rebels. Tunisia responded later that day, following an emergency cabinet meeting: its ambassador to France was recalled; all French troop movements in Tunisia were henceforth forbidden unless approved by Tunisian authorities; and the demand was renewed for the evacuation of all French forces from Tunisia, apart from the naval base at Bizerta. Tunisia also appealed to the UN Security Council. The United States, faced with the dilemma of choosing between supporting France as a NATO ally and promoting U.S. regional influence in North Africa by supporting Tunisia, discouraged Security Council discussions and resolutions, always subject to a Soviet veto.  The debate in the Security Council ended when the U.S. and Britain offered their good offices in an attempt to resolve the dispute. France and Tunisia accepted this offer on 17 February and agreed to begin negotiations. However, the French National Assembly refused to support the government's decision to resume direct talks with Tunisia, and in May, tension increased as clashes broke out once more.  The trigger to the third stage of Tunisia's crisis with France was a violent clash at Remada on 24 May. Once again it responded by complaining to the Security Council, on 29 May. The Security Council debate was suspended on 2 June following an appeal by President de Gaulle to President Bourguiba to settle the differences between the two countries. The crisis came to an end on 17 June following direct negotiations, when France agreed to withdraw all its forces from Tunisia except those at Bizerta.  The USSR was not involved in this crisis.
The three actors in this Middle East Cold War crisis were Turkey, the United States, and Syria. It began on 18 August and ended on 29 October 1957. Syria and the USSR signed a trade agreement in November 1955 and a cultural agreement in August 1956. The Syrian defense minister visited Moscow in July-early August 1957 with an extensive military shopping list, which had been accepted by the Soviets. Some armed clashes and border incidents took place between Syria and Turkey in the summer of 1957. On 18 August 1957 a number of changes in high-ranking positions were formalized in Syria, among them the appointment of pro-Soviet Colonel `Afif Bizri as Chief of Staff of Syria's armed forces. This triggered a crisis for Turkey and the U.S., which feared that Syria had now moved into the Soviet camp. Turkey responded on 21 August with a series of frantic meetings with its Arab neighbors--Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Sa'udi Arabia--and the deployment of troops along its border with Syria. On 7 September Washington reaffirmed the Eisenhower Doctrine, whereby the U.S. would come to the assistance of any Middle East state threatened by "international communism."  This U.S. declaration triggered a crisis for Syria. Damascus responded the next day by announcing that it did not intend to attack any Arab state. Following Khrushchev's severe warning to Turkey, Premier Menderes replied on 21 September that Turkey had no aggressive intentions against Syria.  Two Soviet warships that had been visiting Latakia since 21 September left the Syrian port on 2 October. On the 7th Khrushchev once again accused Turkey of planning to attack Syria; 30,000 Turkish troops were taking part in NATO exercises. The USSR and Syria repeated their allegation at the UN General Assembly on 16 October, specifically, that Turkey, with the support of U.S. advisors, was planning to attack Syria after Turkey's general elections on 27 October. Turkey's UN representative denied the charge.  On 29 October 1957 Khrushchev unexpectedly appeared at a reception held at the Turkish embassy in Moscow, thereby signaling the end of Turkey's crisis and, with it, crisis termination for the other two actors as well. (This surprise move was apparently due to domestic considerations: Marshal Zhukov had been dismissed as Defense Minister, ostensibly as a consequence of his blunder in Syria, but in reality as a result of his challenge to Khrushchev's power.)  The U.S. shipped arms to Jordan. And its Sixth Fleet held maneuvers off Syria. However, its activity in the crisis was mainly political-diplomatic messages and speeches reaffirming commitments to Turkey. NATO's Supreme Commander warned the USSR not to attack Turkey.  (During the last ten days of October, at Syria's request, the crisis was debated by the UN General Assembly. Syria withdrew its complaint on 1 November, a few days after Khrushchev's appearance at the Turkish embassy. By mid-November Turkish forces withdrew from Syria's border.)
Spain's crisis in North Africa began on 23 November 1957 and ended in April 1958. Ifni, a small Spanish enclave in southern Morocco on the Atlantic coast, was ceded to Spain in 1869 and occupied in 1934. In 1956, when Morocco became independent, Spain ceded to the new kingdom the part known as Spanish Morocco on the Mediterranean coast but retained Spanish West Africa and the tiny enclave of Ifni. For several months prior to this crisis, armed bands of the Army for the Liberation of Sahara (AOL) had crossed into Ifni to harass Spanish forces. The AOL was also active in aiding Algeria in its struggle for independence from France (1954-62). Spain requested Morocco to impose its authority on the armed bands and replace them with units of the regular Moroccan army. Since no response was received, Spain decided to reinforce its garrison in Ifni. On 23 November 1957 large-scale fighting broke out between Spanish troops stationed in Ifni and 1,200 Moroccan irregulars, following an attack by the AOL.  Spain's major response to a threat to its territory occurred the next day--heavy bombing of the invading forces. Moroccan government troops were sent to take up positions around Ifni. Several of the AOL camps were dismantled. Spain then threatened to carry the fighting into Agadir, a Moroccan town north of Ifni. Negotiations among several militant Saharan groups and King Mohammed V of Morocco, in the spring of 1958, enabled the king to solidify his authority and permitted Morocco to exercise a restraining influence over guerrilla operations. Spain ceded the Tekna protectorate and Tarfaya to Morocco in April, perhaps as a result of U.S. mediation, terminating the Ifni crisis.  The UN and the USSR were not active in this crisis.  (In January 1969 Spain ceded Ifni to Morocco.)
The Netherlands experienced a crisis over West Irian (West New Guinea) on 1 December 1957. The crisis faded until it erupted into a new crisis almost four years later. In order to prevent last-minute obstacles to the Dutch-Indonesian agreement of 1949 concerning the transfer of power from the Netherlands to the Republic of Indonesia (see Case #127), the issue of West Irian (West New Guinea) had been left open. In November 1957 talks were held between Australian and Dutch leaders on practical measures for improving their joint administration of West Irian. Indonesia, which had begun a campaign for its liberation, viewed this as an attempt to undermine a peaceful outcome to Indonesia's claim to West New Guinea. A crisis for the Netherlands was triggered on 1 December 1957 when Indonesia's minister of information authorized a general strike by all Indonesian workers employed by Dutch enterprises. This was followed by a ban on all Dutch publications and on KLM landings in Indonesia. A large number of Dutch businesses were seized by groups of Indonesian workers and youth. The Dutch response, on 3 December, was a statement by the prime minister pledging the safeguarding of Dutch national interests in Indonesia. On 5 December the Indonesian minister of justice announced that some 50,000 Dutch nationals would be expelled and that all Dutch consulates, with the exception of the one in Djakarta, would be closed. On the 6th the Netherlands government called for an urgent session of the North Atlantic Council, which met but did not issue an official statement. This was followed on 9 December by an Indonesian decree placing all Dutch-owned estates and plantations under the control of the Indonesian government. Another Netherlands attempt to gain international support was made on 23 December with a letter to the UN Secretary-General asking that the situation be brought before the General Assembly and the Security Council. In the meantime two Dutch navy destroyers were dispatched to reinforce troops already in the New Guinea area.  There is no clear termination date. The issue lingered on at below-crisis level until 1961 (see Case #187).  The U.S. was marginally involved in this crisis, the USSR not at all.
The two crisis actors were Iraq and Jordan. The crisis began on 1 February and ended on 14 February 1958. An announcement by King Hussein of Jordan in April 1957 of the discovery of a Syrian-Egyptian plot against him led to the dismissal of the entire Jordanian cabinet and a political swing to the Right (see Case #157--Jordan Regime). As a result Jordan's relations with Syria and Egypt worsened, and a violent anti-Jordan campaign of defamation ensued in those countries.  In Iraq, since Nuri Al-Sa'id's return to power in 1954, close collaboration with the West existed simultaneously with a repressive domestic regime. Discontent among the politically articulate elements of the population grew--Arab nationalists, liberals, communists, traditionalists, and army officers. And as the popularity of Egypt's Nasir increased, the Iraqi regime looked for ways to counter Egyptian influence on its citizens. A crisis was triggered for Iraq and Jordan when the merger of Egypt and Syria into the United Arab Republic (UAR) was proclaimed on 1 February 1958. This was perceived by the Hashemite rulers, King Hussein of Jordan and King Feisal of Iraq, as an act to incite the revolutionary pan-Arab movement and the Arab peoples to rise against existing Arab governments in order to join the UAR. The merger changed the Middle East subsystem: the Syrian Republic ceased to exist, and the new UAR was controlled by Nasir, giving it a population larger than all other Arab states combined. Hussein suggested a meeting with Feisal, which would include King Ibn Sa'ud of Sa'udi Arabia, to discuss the possibility of a similar union. On 11 February an Iraqi delegation arrived in Amman. Their response was a joint Proclamation on 14 February 1958 establishing the Arab Federation. This marked the end of the crisis for both Iraq and Jordan. Sa'udi Arabia sent a representative to the talks but did not sign the Proclamation. At first Nasir accepted the formation of the Federation, but two weeks later he attacked it as an arrangement between reactionaries who lacked the support of their subjects.  There was no violence during this Middle East crisis.  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
There was one crisis actor, Sudan. The crisis occurred between 9 and 25 February 1958. Egypt claimed two areas lying north of the 22nd Parallel that had been administered by Sudan since 1902.  A plebiscite on the formation of the United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria) was scheduled for 21 February. Forthcoming Sudanese elections were to be held six days later. On 1 February 1958 the Egyptian government sent a note to the Sudanese government charging Sudan with making arrangements for elections in areas north of the 1899 frontier. On 9 February 1958 a crisis was triggered for Sudan when it received reports that Egyptian army units were being sent to the disputed area. There were several strands to Sudan's response: a statement on 18 February in reply to an Egyptian Note received that day, declaring Sudan's determination to defend its sovereign territory; the dispatch of Sudanese troops to the area; a complaint to the UN Secretary-General; and a request for Arab League intervention on 20 February.  The Security Council met on 21 February but did not pass a resolution. However, Egypt, realizing that its case did not carry much weight, and after the Secretary-General of the Arab League consulted with Egypt, moved to settle the dispute expeditiously. On 25 February the Sudan government announced that the Egyptian flag had been taken down at Abu Ramada and that Egyptian forces had been removed. The crisis ended on 25 February without violence.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
An internally generated international crisis for Indonesia took place from 21 February until 20 May 1958. A series of bloodless army coups in regional districts of Indonesia served to undermine the power of the central government in Djakarta. Nationwide martial law was imposed in March 1957. The dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia over West Irian had not been resolved in UN discussions. An abortive attempt on President Sukarno's life took place on 30 November 1956. On 3 December labor groups began seizing Dutch enterprises in Indonesia: within a fortnight virtually all were under military control. That month 46,000 Dutch nationals were repatriated. Tension between the president and regional powers was high. By 10 February 1958 opposition in the outer islands had erupted. An ultimatum demanding central government changes was rejected by the Djakarta cabinet the following day. On the 15th a revolutionary state was proclaimed. U.S. sympathies lay with the anti-communist secessionists, and there is evidence that U.S. military aid had arrived in West Sumatra before the ultimatum, along with the presence of U.S. intelligence officers. Sukarno returned to Indonesia on 16 February and called for cabinet deliberations to consider the issue of civil war, compounded by an apparent threat of possible U.S. intervention. The first indication of an Indonesian government perception of a threat of foreign involvement was Sukarno's rejection of rebel demands on 21 February 1958: in his call for measures against the rebels, he cited his conviction that the rebels were acting as instruments of a foreign power, clearly implying the U.S., which wished to force Indonesia to join the Western bloc. Indonesia's major response was a military move against the rebels in central Sumatra on 22 February, with air force bombing and strafing. During the course of the fighting, from 7 to 12 March, government paratroops occupied Pakanbahru, where U.S. personnel were located at oil fields. This step was taken partly out of fear that the U.S. might send in marines. The Seventh Fleet, situated offshore, caused great anxiety in Djakarta, where anti-American sentiments were at a fever pitch. By mid-April two key rebel towns had fallen. After the fall of Padang, the U.S. began an effort to improve relations with Indonesia. U.S. Ambassador Jones's initiatives met with positive Indonesian responses. On 20 May, in the form of an official statement, Secretary of State Dulles formally reiterated the U.S. position of not being involved in what was an internal Indonesian affair. The statement set in motion a chain of events pointing to a rapprochement between the two states and marks the end of Indonesia's crisis.  The USSR provided political support to Indonesia during this crisis. The UN was not involved.  (The rebellion lasted until 4 April 1961. There was guerrilla warfare with several thousand casualties.)
Riots in Lebanon and a coup in Iraq precipitated an international crisis for four states, Lebanon, Jordan, the U.S., and the U.K., lasting from 8 May to the end of October 1958. A crisis in Lebanon occurred during a period of continuing unrest in the Middle East. The United States, in an effort to counter a Soviet threat to U.S. interests, tried to unify the pro-Western Arab states through the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in January 1957, pledging U.S. aid to any Middle East state attacked by "international communism." It was publicly supported by Lebanon alone. President Nasir's strong anti-Western policy was strengthened by the union of Syria and Egypt in February 1958, which weakened Sa'udi Arabia and Lebanon while bringing Iraq and Jordan closer together in an Arab Federation set up at the same time (see Case #162--Formation of UAR).  In Iraq discontent focused on the Baghdad Pact of 1955 (CENTO [Central Treaty Organization]) (see Case #148). A conspiratorial group of "Free Officers" hostile to the monarchy laid plans for a coup and elected Brigadier 'Abd-ul-Karim Qassem as Chairman of the Executive Committee. A crisis for Lebanon was triggered on 8 May 1958 by the murder of a reformist editor of a pro-communist Beirut newspaper, a vocal critic of President Camille Chamoun's Western orientation, including his attempt to amend Lebanon's constitution in order to run for a second term. Opposition elements believed the government was responsible for the assassination. Full-scale rioting ensued. On the 12th the Lebanese army took over security in Beirut, Tripoli, and other cities.  Lebanon responded to the crisis with several acts. Foreign Minister Malik accused the UAR of massive interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. Chamoun sent a message to Eisenhower inquiring about American action if he were to request U.S. assistance. On 21 May Lebanon lodged a formal complaint with the League of Arab States: its attempt to settle the dispute took the form of a neutral resolution without any call for action. And on 22 May Chamoun brought the matter to the UN Security Council.  The Council's discussions on 6 and 11 June resulted in a Swedish-sponsored resolution to dispatch an Observer Group to Lebanon to determine if there was infiltration from Egypt or Syria across the Lebanon border. The group's first report, submitted on 3 July, indicated no border infiltration. Lebanon criticized the report as being inconclusive and misleading. It also contended that the number of observers was insufficient to cover the entire border area and that their activity was ineffective.  On 14 July, a successful coup in Baghdad against the Hashemite monarch triggered a crisis for the United States. The same day U.S. marines were ordered to Lebanon in an attempt to end the violence and stabilize the area. The coup in Baghdad, followed by the dispatch of U.S. troops to Lebanon, triggered a crisis for Jordan and Britain. King Hussein appealed to the U.K. for help on the 16th; and the following day British paratroops landed in Jordan. By 31 July the situation in Lebanon was sufficiently calm to allow a special presidential election: Fu'ad Shihab was elected President.  When Security Council action was effectively blocked by a Soviet veto, an Emergency Session of the General Assembly was called for 8 August. After 15 meetings a mild resolution was adopted, calling on all parties to abide by the Arab League's principle of nonintervention.  A Five-Power Summit Conference called for by Khrushchev did not take place: on 5 August the Soviet leader withdrew his support for a conference. Events in Lebanon remained unstable; and it was not until 14 October that tension dissipated with the acceptance of the new government in Lebanon by all political factions, marking the end of the crisis for Lebanon and the U.S.  The crisis faded for the U.K. and Jordan toward the end of October 1958. At that time King Hussein voiced his perception that the crisis had terminated. The crisis ended with no agreement among the adversaries.  The USSR's involvement was mainly political, but Soviet warships moved westward through the Baltic during the crisis, an act interpreted as an attempt to prevent the victory of pro-U.S. Lebanese forces.
A second international crisis in the Taiwan Strait, from 17 July to 23 October 1958, comprised three actors: Taiwan, the United States, and the People's Republic of China. East Asia again became a theater of armed conflict between communist and anti-communist forces in 1958, breaking an informal truce that prevailed in the region since 1955 (see Case #146). The unresolved issue of "one China" erupted once more, at the same time as a new crisis in the Middle East, when U.S. forces landed in Lebanon, British forces entered Jordan, and the Iraq monarchy was overthrown (see Case #165--Iraq-Lebanon Upheaval, in Middle East: Non-PCs). The PRC was critical of Soviet silence on Middle East and East Asian events and decided to test Soviet and U.S. resolve by building up its forces in the coastal areas opposite the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu. By 17 July 1958 the massing of mainland China's military forces near the offshore islands had triggered a crisis for Taiwan. Khrushchev arrived in Beijing for conversations with Mao from 31 July to 3 August. On the 23rd of August, when the PRC began bombarding Quemoy and Matsu, a crisis was triggered for the United States. Taiwan responded that day by returning fire. The U.S. responded two days later by threatening to move into the area with the reinforced Seventh Fleet, a decision implemented with some restriction on the 27th. This, in turn, triggered a crisis for the PRC.  Between 2 and 4 September the U.S. administration met to frame a detailed policy position. On the 4th the PRC responded to the crisis by announcing the extension of its territorial waters to 12 miles offshore, thereby blockading Quemoy and Matsu. This threat to U.S. ships supplying the islands was promptly rejected by the U.S. in a statement by Secretary of State Dulles, who strongly implied that the U.S. would intervene if Quemoy were invaded, and that such an intervention might involve the use of nuclear weapons. Zhou Enlai suggested that ambassadorial talks between the PRC and the U.S. be resumed.  On 7 September Khrushchev sent a letter to Eisenhower in which he warned that "an attack on the PRC is an attack on the Soviet Union." Nevertheless, one week later it was clear that the Soviets intended to remain aloof from the crisis. Talks between the PRC and the United States were resumed in Warsaw on 14 September, ending the crisis for the latter. On the 30th the crisis ended for the PRC when Secretary Dulles declared that the U.S. favored the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese forces from the offshore islands if the PRC would agree to a cease-fire. Taiwan's crisis termination date was 23 October, when Chiang and Dulles issued a joint communiqué: this constituted a tacit understanding between Taiwan and the PRC, for there was a clear indication that an invasion of the mainland would not be supported by the U.S. Washington recommended a redefinition of Nationalist China's objectives.  The Soviet position was clarified in a Tass news agency statement on 5 October that excluded military support for Beijing's efforts to "liberate" Taiwan. However, while publicly disavowing Soviet military intervention in the crisis, Moscow extended covert aid in support of the PRC.  The General Assembly held discussions, but no resolution was passed.
A crisis for Thailand and Cambodia took place from 24 July 1958 to 6 February 1959. Relations between these two Southeast Asian states had been tense for centuries; for long periods Thailand occupied Cambodian territory. Ideological differences, mixed border populations, and extreme suspicion on both sides persisted. The temple of Khao Phra Viharrn, a place of worship for the Cambodian Khmer, was accessible only through Thai-held territory, and even then with much difficulty. Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia claimed that the territory surrounding the temple was part of Cambodia, according to a Franco-Siamese (Thai) treaty of 1907, while the Thai foreign minister claimed it belonged to Thailand, according to the geographic principle of "natural watershed." A crisis for Thailand was triggered on 24 July 1958 when diplomatic relations were established between Cambodia and the PRC. Thailand, fearing communist infiltration, declared a state of emergency on the Cambodian border on 8 August. Negotiations followed, with a final Thai offer to allow Cambodian visitors to the site of the temple. Cambodia rejected the offer. When the negotiations broke down, Thailand's response took a military form: on 1 September 10 bridges on the Thai-Cambodian border were blown up in order to prevent infiltration. This triggered a crisis for Cambodia, which feared Thai involvement in its internal affairs and perceived Thai ambitions to rule all Buddhist countries in Indochina once more. On 7 September several thousand Thais marched to the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Cambodia's response was a de facto suspension of diplomatic relations on 24 November 1958. The following day Thailand closed the border between the two countries, withdrew its ambassador from Phnom Penh, and suspended air service between the capitals. The United Nations was introduced into the crisis when Cambodians asked Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to appoint a UN mediator. Baron Johan Beck-Friis, a retired Swiss diplomat, mediated between the adversaries, providing fact-finding and formulaic assistance to the two conflicting parties. On 6 February 1959, a joint communiqué announced the reopening of the frontier and the return of the respective ambassadors to each other's capital.
The crisis over the Berlin Deadline began on 27 November 1958 and lasted until 15 September 1959. The crisis actors were France, the U.K., the U.S., West Germany, East Germany, and the USSR. Since the end of World War II Berlin--and Germany as a whole--had been administered as four zones by the victorious powers: France, the U.K., the United States, and the Soviet Union. The Berlin Blockade crisis occurred in 1948-49 (see Case #123). An abortive East German Uprising took place in 1953 (see Case #141, in Europe: Non-PCs). The crises of 1956 in Poland and Hungary (see Cases #154 and #155, in Europe: Non-PCs) caused further apprehension in the Kremlin about the appeal of West Berlin for East Berliners and East Germans generally, offering them a haven from the rigors of socialism as practiced in the DDR. West Germany's role within NATO and its extensive rearmament were of primary concern to the Soviet Union. In the summer and autumn of 1957 the USSR demonstrated new missile and rocket capabilities. In response, the U.S. proposed sending tactical nuclear weapons and intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Europe, including Germany, but under U.S. control. This was transformed into formal Western policy on 15 December, in the form of a NATO foreign ministers resolution. This reinforced Moscow's deep mistrust of the intentions of the U.S., the Western bloc, and West Germany vis-à-vis East Germany and the Communist bloc generally. But Moscow did not yet manifest crisis behavior.  Moscow first tried to prevent this ominous development by calling for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, along with conventional force reductions and measures to prevent surprise attacks in Europe. It also announced unilateral troop reductions. The Kremlin then proposed a summit conference and threatened to deploy ballistic missiles in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Poland if NATO would not agree to the Soviet proposals. When none of the above had any effect on Western determination to rearm Germany, Khrushchev decided upon harsher measures. In a speech on 10 November 1958 he announced that the Soviet Union intended to turn over control of East Berlin, including all access routes to West Berlin, to East Germany (the German Democratic Republic or DDR), thus forcing the West to recognize and to deal with East Germany. High tension, normal in the Cold War, was approaching crisis intensity. Khrushchev, increasingly concerned about publicly announced U.S.-NATO plans to nuclearize the East/West conflict in Europe, especially the West German army, and to undermine the DDR, and under mounting pressure from East Germany's Walter Ulbricht, initiated a crisis for France, the U.K., the U.S., and West Germany by an ultimatum on 27 November 1958. A Note to the four Western ambassadors in Moscow proposed that West Berlin be demilitarized and declared a "Free City," a status that would be guaranteed by the Western powers, the Soviet Union, and, perhaps, the United Nations. If no agreement could be reached on this proposal within six months, the Soviet government would turn over to the DDR full sovereignty over East Berlin, including access routes to West Berlin. At a press conference the same day the Soviet leader denied that the six months constituted an ultimatum but stated that Moscow did indeed intend to carry out its proposals; and should the West use force against the Ulbricht regime, the USSR was committed militarily to the defense of East Germany as a Warsaw Pact ally. On 11 December the Tass news agency warned that a Western attempt to force its way into West Berlin by land, an option considered in the 1948 Berlin Blockade crisis (see Case #123), would lead to war. Foreign Minister Gromyko repeated the warning two weeks later.  After several rounds of negotiations among the three Western powers, their joint response, on 14 December 1958, was a communiqué that rejected the Soviet Note and its repudiation of USSR obligations to the Western powers to maintain the status quo in Berlin and vis-à-vis the access routes. After approval by the NATO Council, the formal replies of France, the U.K., and the United States were presented to Moscow on 31 December. West Germany's reply was presented on 5 January 1959.  The firm Western response triggered a crisis for both East Germany and the Soviet Union: a higher value threat--the continued viability of the DDR; a (self-imposed) time pressure, the 27 May 1959 deadline; and the distinctly higher probability of military hostilities with the West over the future status of West Berlin.  On 7 January 1959 the East German government announced its support for the Soviet proposal. On 10 January the Soviet Union responded to the reply of the Western powers by presenting a draft of a peace treaty with Germany to all countries who fought against Germany between 1939 and 1945. And on 16 February the three Western powers and West Germany sent replies with NATO approval, counterproposing a Foreign Ministers' Conference to deal with the problem of Germany. Moscow agreed to a Foreign Ministers' Conference for 2 March, but the proposed agenda was unacceptable to the West. The Soviet Union also demanded a summit conference for the end of April.  Further negotiations for lower and higher level conferences took place among the crisis actors. The UN Secretary-General attempted conciliation. On 19 March Khrushchev revealed his willingness to accede to a Foreign Ministers' Conference on 11 May if the agenda were limited to Berlin and a German peace treaty, implying the need for a summit meeting to discuss the larger issues of disarmament and European defense. This was made formal in Notes dated 28 March 1959. On 30 March the Soviet Union formally agreed to a May conference, in return for U.S. agreement to a summit conference the following year.  Nonetheless, the crisis escalated. Still suspicious of Soviet intentions, the U.S. began to reinforce its combat and support units in Europe, and U.S. transport planes prepared for an airlift. In May, as the deadline of the six months from 27 November approached, U.S. aircraft carriers with nuclear weapons aboard were redeployed to the Mediterranean, and marines were alerted for rapid movement to West Berlin.  An interim agreement was signed on 3 August 1959, after 25 sessions of the Foreign Ministers Conference, when President Eisenhower visited Khrushchev in Moscow. The formal agreement was signed on a return visit to Washington on 15 September, the crisis termination date for all the participants. The agreement called for the banning of all nuclear weapons and missiles from Berlin and the limiting of Anglo-French-U.S. forces in the city. Negotiations on Germany would be resumed.
A crisis between these two states lasted from 29 December 1958 to 1 February 1959. Mexico observed a nine-mile territorial water limit off its shores while Guatemala regarded its own territorial waters as extending to 12 miles. Mexican fishers had been fishing for shrimp in what Guatemala considered its territorial waters. On 29 December 1958 the president of Guatemala articulated his perception of a crisis stemming from an economic threat from Mexico and warned it of impending attack if its fishers did not leave Guatemalan waters. Guatemala's response, and the trigger for Mexico, occurred on 31 December when Guatemalan planes strafed three Mexican shrimp boats off the Pacific coast, killing three fishers and wounding 14 others. Mexico's response was a severe protest to Guatemala on 3 January 1959. The crisis ended for Mexico on 12 January 1959, the day 200 Mexican shrimp boats began fishing in the same general area of the incident, after receiving an official promise from the Guatemalan government that its planes would not attack them. The termination date for Guatemala was 1 February 1959, the day the president of Mexico proposed a peaceful settlement with Guatemala and requested information about its terms for a settlement. Guatemala responded favorably.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
This crisis involved four actors: Panama, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. It began on 25 April 1959 and ended toward the close of 1959. The Batista dictatorship in Cuba collapsed on 1 January 1959 when Fidel Castro established control. The new Cuban government welcomed exiles from Latin American countries and aided them in organizing revolutionary activities. All four actor-cases derived from invasions in which exiles and the Cuban armed forces tried to establish a revolutionary government in each of the four states previously noted. In all, a grave economic situation existed, and domestic unrest was prevalent. The first to experience a crisis was Panama, where a boat carrying 80-90 foreign invaders landed on 25 April 1959. Panama responded the following day by requesting assistance from the OAS, which agreed to supply arms, as well as to send an inquiry committee. Castro, recognizing OAS disapproval, denounced the invaders on 28 April and sent two government officials to persuade the invaders to surrender. They did so on 1 May. The following day an OAS international naval patrol off the Panama coast was authorized. The crisis terminated for Panama on 4 May 1959 when the naval and aerial patrols were called off and the OAS investigating committee returned to Washington.  On 1 June a small force of Nicaraguan exiles from Costa Rica landed in two areas of Nicaragua. An emergency session of the OAS was held on 2 June, and a fact-finding mission was sent two days later to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. President Somoza accepted the Costa Rican expression of neutrality and did not view the latter as the source of threat to Nicaragua. On 11 June the rebellion was crushed as a result of a swift military response by Nicaragua. On 13 June Somoza accused Castro of personally preparing the master plan for the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. The crisis ended on 14 June 1959 when a victory parade was held in Nicaragua.  The third in this series of low-intensity crises was an invasion of the Dominican Republic on 14 June 1959, which met with military resistance. The economic situation in the Dominican Republic was particularly grave, with mounting terror and government repression. On 24 June Trujillo declared that the invasion, assisted by the Cuban navy, had been repelled. A complaint was lodged against Cuba at the OAS on 2 July, but because of an unfavorable OAS attitude toward the Trujillo regime, the Dominican Republic did not request an emergency session. Tension remained high for several more months and dissolved slowly at the end of 1959.  Haiti was invaded on 13 August 1959, during a period of extreme instability and terror. The response occurred on the 16th with a Note to the OAS foreign ministers charging Cuba with responsibility. And on 5 September the Haiti government announced the surrender of the invaders.  The OAS was actively involved throughout this multiple crisis, assisting each state in its confrontation with the Cuban threat. Fact-finding missions were sent. Superpower involvement was relatively limited. The U.S. sought to maintain stability in the area by organizing a naval mission to patrol the Caribbean waters and authorizing it to shoot in order to bar any communist-led invasion attempt. The USSR was not involved in the crisis; but it made known its support of Castro's Cuban government.
A border crisis for the PRC and India began on 25 August 1959 and ended on 19 April 1960. The basis of India's claim to the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was the Simla Agreement of 1914 between British India and the semiautonomous Tibet government, and the accompanying McMahon Line. Although initialed by the representative of the central Chinese government, this agreement was not formally ratified by China then or later. The border issue was accentuated in 1958 when the Chinese Communist regime completed the construction of the Aksai Chin road in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in the west, linking Tibet to China's province of Sinkiang. On 25 August 1959 Indian patrols in the region of Longju, NEFA, were perceived by the PRC as challenging its version of where that border village lay--on the Indian or Chinese side. The PRC, perceiving a threat, responded that day by attacking Indian positions at Longju. This attack triggered a crisis for India. On the 28th Prime Minister Nehru informed the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, that a Chinese detachment of 200-300 men had crossed into Indian territory at Longju three days earlier. At the same time he revealed correspondence between the two governments since 1954 on alleged Chinese border violations and other issues in Sino/Indian relations. On 20 October 1959 another incident occurred at the Kongka Pass in the Ladakh area of northeast Kashmir. In addition, China's Premier Zhou Enlai explicitly refused to recognize the existing McMahon Line and claimed large tracts of NEFA's territory.  India's response, on 1 November 1959, was an announcement by Nehru that the Indian army would assume control of the border posts in Ladakh, Kashmir, from police detachments. Nehru described those border incidents as challenges by China to India's territorial integrity. PRC suggestions for negotiations were followed by a series of letters between Nehru and Zhou Enlai. A meeting between the two leaders, convened on 19 April 1960, ended this initial crisis. The meetings led to the creation of a Joint Officials Committee to examine relevant documents and to report points of disagreement and agreement.  Superpower involvement was limited to diplomatic activity. The United States expressed strong sympathy for India's attempts to resolve the issue peacefully. The Soviets adopted a neutral position, which was viewed unfavorably by the PRC. (See Case #194--China/India Border II.)  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Iraq and Iran over their joint waterway lasted from 28 November 1959 to 4 January 1960. The trigger for Iraq was a press conference on 28 November 1959 where the Shah described the status quo concerning the Shatt-al-Arab as "intolerable." Prime Minister Qassem's response, the trigger for Iran, was a reiteration of Iraq's claim to the waterway on 2 December. Border clashes were reported on 10 and 15 December. Iran's frontier guards were reinforced on the 15th. Iraq sent a protest two days later. On the 22nd Iraq claimed that numerous Iranian border violations had occurred, including an 11-kilometer penetration of its territory. On 23 December Iran placed its military forces on full alert; previously Iran had been moving troops to the Iraqi border. By the last week in December both actors had expressed a willingness to negotiate their differences. The termination date for both was 4 January 1960 when an Iranian ship was allowed to pass through the Shatt unmolested.  The U.S. and U.K. proposed talks between the adversaries; and the USSR broadcast propaganda against Iran. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Egypt and Israel occurred between 15 February and 8 March 1960. Acts of terror in Israel by infiltrators crossing the border from Syria, and a subsequent Israeli retaliation raid in early February 1960, preceded this crisis. At that time Egypt and Syria constituted a single political entity, the United Arab Republic (UAR) (see Case #162--Formation of UAR, in 1958, in Middle East: Non-PCs). On 15 February 1960 President Nasir received a message from the Soviet embassy in Cairo claiming that Israel's troops were massing on its northern border, with an intention to attack Syria. In order to offset this danger, Egypt began secret troop maneuvers across the Suez Canal in Sinai toward the Israeli border, on the 19th. On 23 February Israeli intelligence notified Prime Minister (and Minister of Defense) Ben Gurion that the major part of the Egyptian army had crossed the Canal and was situated near Israel's southern border. This triggered a crisis for Israel. The following day Israel responded by moving its forces southward in army maneuvers, termed Rottem by the Israel Defense Forces. Egypt's crisis ended on 1 March 1960 when its forces began to return to their bases west of the Canal. Israel reciprocated soon after. And, one week later, on 8 March, Israel's prime minister departed for an official visit to the United States. This act indicated a reduction of tension and the end of Israel's crisis.  The Soviet Union was politically involved in support of Egypt (the UAR). The U.S. and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Ghana lasted from early March to 1 April 1960. In 1956 a majority of voters in a plebiscite held in the Trust Territory of British Togoland voted to accede to Ghana instead of to the adjoining area under French jurisdiction. Counterdemands were made for the reunification of the two Togos and the creation of a Togolese state within its pre-1914 German colonial frontiers. In October 1958 the announcement by France that Togo would receive its independence in April 1960 revived the dispute. In October 1959 and again in January 1960 Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana called for the integration of the two countries after Togo's independence. The future President of Togo, Sylvanus Olympio, rejected the idea of a merger with Ghana. A crisis for Ghana was triggered in early March 1960 when a draft constitution for the Republic of Togo was uncovered by Ghanaian government agents. It laid claim to the territory of the formerly British Togoland, which had been incorporated into Ghana as the Volta region. Furthermore, a plot by irregular forces, inhabitants of the Volta region trained in Togo, to infiltrate and attack Ghana in the last week of March was uncovered. After France ignored a formal Ghanaian protest requesting that it take immediate action to prevent the territory under its administration from serving as a base for an armed attack against Ghana, Nkrumah convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet. Cabinet members were asked to approve the following decisions taken by an ad hoc committee on 14 March: to strengthen security forces in the Volta region; to arrest opposition leaders and those involved in the plot; and to issue a public statement. Annual army exercises were carried out in the Volta region between 22 and 28 March, and an additional army battalion was sent to the region in April.  After the date of the expected invasion passed without incident the tension began to subside. The termination date was 1 April when a decision was made to send top-level Ghanaian delegates to Togo's independence celebrations. (Subsequent to the crisis, a meeting between Nkrumah and Olympio was held on 12 June 1960 where agreement was reached on a union for economic and political cooperation.)  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
A crisis between Venezuela and the Dominican Republic occurred from 24 June to mid-September 1960. Diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic were broken by Venezuela in June 1959. In February 1960 a charge of flagrant violations of human rights was made to the OAS against the Dominican Republic by the Venezuelan government. An assassination attempt on Venezuelan President Betancourt triggered the crisis on 24 June 1960. Dominican Republic complicity was suspected when it was learned that the plot was organized by Venezuelan exiles living there. In addition, the Dominican Republic radio reported the assassination attempt 15 minutes after it occurred. On the 25th Venezuela accused Trujillo of initiating it. This triggered a crisis for the Dominican Republic, which feared a Venezuelan attack on its territory. The Dominican Republic promptly denied all charges. Its major response, on 27 June, was to place the Dominican armed forces on alert and to call for general mobilization. The Congress met in emergency session the following day.  Venezuelan countermeasures consisted of placing its army on alert and issuing another formal accusation against the Dominican Republic. On 30 June a state of emergency was declared in Venezuela after Trujillo accused Venezuela of preparing for war in order to overthrow his regime. Venezuela's major response, on 1 July, was to call for an emergency session of the OAS and to press for a resolution of sanctions against the Dominican Republic. President Betancourt stated that, if no measures were taken against Trujillo by the OAS, Venezuela would act unilaterally. An investigation committee was appointed by the OAS on 8 July. On 20 August a resolution was passed condemning the Dominican Republic's "acts of aggression and intervention." It called upon the members of the OAS to break off diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic and to impose an arms embargo, along with partial economic sanctions. This terminated the crisis for Venezuela.  During the OAS debate the United States attempted unsuccessfully to have a more conciliatory resolution passed, fearing a replacement of the Trujillo government by a communist regime. The U.S. then complied with the resolution by withholding the Dominican Republic's sugar quota and breaking off diplomatic relations.  On 5 September, at an urgent meeting of the Security Council, the USSR called for a resolution to act upon OAS sanctions, but it was not passed. The crisis for the Dominican Republic faded in mid-September.
The two crisis actors were Belgium and Congo. The crisis lasted from 5 July 1960 to 15 February 1962. Belgian Congo was granted independence on 30 June 1960. Lumumba became the first Prime Minister and Defense Minister and Kasavubu the first President. The country had been plagued by tribal fighting and serious disorders. A Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in Leopoldville between Congo and Belgium. The trigger for Belgium, on 5 July 1960, was a mutiny among soldiers of the Congolese Force Publique which rapidly turned into a general assault against Belgian and other European residents. Belgium responded on the 8th by announcing its intention to send troop reinforcements to Congo. A crisis was triggered for Congo two days later when Belgian troops went into action.  Lumumba decried Belgium's alleged violation of their friendship treaty. A request to President Eisenhower to restore order was denied. Tshombe, leader of mineral-rich Katanga, announced its independence on 11 July, triggering a second Congo crisis. That day, too, Lumumba responded by appealing to the UN. Belgium announced on the 13th that it would not withdraw its troops. The Soviet Union issued a statement condemning what it termed Western and NATO aggression against Congo. On 14 July the UN Security Council passed a resolution to establish a UN military force in Congo and requested the withdrawal of Belgium's forces. Lumumba demanded the withdrawal of Belgian diplomats as well and declared a state of war between the two countries.  The resolution did not, however, accept Lumumba's demands to oust Tshombe and reintegrate Katanga by force. The two adversaries accepted the Security Council's resolution, though without enthusiasm, ending their dyadic crisis on the 15th.  Lumumba's forces began receiving aid from the USSR, and the split between him and Kasavubu increased. Internal developments in Congo prevented a quick solution. On 14 September 1960 Colonel Mobutu announced that the army was taking control. A new central government was finally formed on 9 February 1961. An announcement of Lumumba's death was made on 13 February. On 21 March the UN Secretary-General's Conciliation Committee on the Congo recommended a federal form of government to preserve the country's unity and integrity. On 1 August President Kasavubu invited Adoula, a moderate, to form a new government.  The UN Security Council passed a resolution calling upon the Secretary-General to organize and dispatch an emergency military force. Pressure was exerted by the U.S. to bring Tshombe and Adoula together. And on 18 December 1961 a provisional cease-fire was announced that led to the Kitona Agreement of 21 December, with a unilateral declaration by Tshombe that the Katanga secession was over and a pledge to recognize the indivisible unity of Congo Republic. The crisis ended for Congo on 15 February 1962 when the Katanga Assembly ratified Tshombe's declaration and agreed to end its secession.
A crisis for Mali and Senegal occurred from 20 August to 22 September 1960. The Mali Federation, consisting of Senegal, the Soudan (later, Mali), Upper Volta, and Dahomey, was created in June 1959 and became independent one year later. Upper Volta and Dahomey left the Federation immediately thereafter, and the two remaining countries decided to appoint a federal president with wide authority. This appointment was the cause of a bitter dispute between Senegal and the Soudan over control of the presidency. Elections never took place because the Federation ended one week before the scheduled elections. Senegal, whose political system tolerated open opposition, among them Soudan supporters, perceived itself to be in danger of being placed in a permanent minority despite the constitutional balance built into the Federation. It warned the Soudan to stop intervention into Senegal's internal affairs. A crisis was triggered for Mali, then known as the Soudan, on 20 August 1960 when Senegal President Senghor declared its independence from the Federation. Mali's President, Modibo Keita, proclaimed a state of emergency and called upon France to intervene. The Mali response, the same day, triggered a crisis for Senegal, whose president, on 20 August, broadcast an impassioned speech accusing Mali of desiring the colonization and enslavement of the Senegalese people. A state of emergency was declared in Senegal; the army took control of the capital, Dakar, and all Mali ministers, as well as soldiers who had been stationed in Senegal, were returned to Bamako, the capital of Mali, the following day. France, which had ignored Keita's call for intervention, recognized Senegal's independence on 11 September 1960.  On 22 September the Soudan ended the Federation and proclaimed its independence, adopting the name of Mali. When the Federation ceased to exist, the crisis ended for both actors.  Discussions were held in the Security Council, but no resolution was passed. The USSR gave political support to Mali. The U.S. was not involved.
This crisis occurred from 9 November to 7 December 1960, with two actors, Nicaragua and Guatemala. In 1959 Panama, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti were confronted with crises involving Cuban-supported rebels (see Case #170--Central America/Cuba I). Each state succeeded, with OAS support, in repelling the invaders. In Guatemala, domestic political and economic instability was present, with high unemployment, demonstrations, strikes, and rapid inflation. Nicaragua was invaded once more on 9 November 1960 when exiles crossed into its territory from Costa Rica and captured two small towns. Martial law was imposed, and troops were rushed to the area. And on 13 November dissident units of the Guatemalan army seized a port 70 miles northeast of Guatemala City. President Ydigoras responded on 14 November by stating that the government had proof of Cuban involvement and appealed to the U.S. to dispatch naval and air patrols. The revolt in Guatemala collapsed on the 16th.  The Nicaraguan response was an appeal to the United States on 17 November. That day President Eisenhower announced that surface and air units of the United States navy would act to prevent invasions by communist-directed elements. The crisis for both Nicaragua and Guatemala ended when the U.S. president, having received assurances from both governments that coastal defense was no longer required, ordered the withdrawal of the Caribbean patrol on 7 December 1960.  During the crisis Guatemala and Nicaragua submitted a joint complaint about Cuban interference to the OAS. This was denied by Cuba, which protested the U.S. naval presence in the area, describing it as a violation of the principle of nonintervention and an act of aggression.  Soviet and Chinese newspapers and broadcasts took a similar stand. The UN was marginally involved.
A crisis for Ethiopia began on 26 December 1960 and faded after about a year, with no fixed termination date. On 26 December 1960, 7,000 Somali tribesmen surrounded an Ethiopian police garrison and launched a heavy attack. The Ethiopian response occurred on the 29th when military units, including the air force, invaded Somalia, forcing the tribesmen to retreat. A strong protest was sent from Ethiopia to Somalia. The crisis continued with accusations, violence, and clashes for several months thereafter. During January 1961 Ethiopia bombed Somalia; there were clashes between their forces in Haud; Somalia postponed an oil shipment to Ethiopia; and the leader of the nationalist movement in Somalia warned of an imminent war. On 5 February there was a Somali invasion of Ethiopia with propaganda distributed in the disputed province. The All-African People's Conference of 1961 decided in favor of Ethiopia. In May, at the Monrovia Conference, an appeal was made to both sides to renew their efforts for a settlement. On 25 August talks were held between President Osman of Somalia and Emperor Haile Selassie at the Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade. On 31 August clashes were reported once again between Somali tribesmen and Ethiopians. And on 27 September there was an official complaint from Somalia that the dispute was not yet solved.  The superpowers maintained a neutral stance in the 1960 crisis. The UN was not involved. And the OAU was not yet in existence.
The first Pathet Lao crisis for the United States and Thailand began on 9 March and ended on 16 May 1961. From December 1960 supplies and equipment from the Soviet Union had been airlifted to the Pathet Lao. This aid included heavy weapons and combat specialists. A crisis for the United States was triggered on 9 March 1961 when Pathet Lao troops, with Vietminh support, launched a major offensive breaking through the Laotian government defenses in central Laos, severing the key road junction between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. The Laotian troops retreated and, within days, the two cities were threatened by communist and neutralist troops.  President Kennedy felt that, if Laos were to be abandoned, the communists would hold the north-south road along the Mekong lowlands from which stronger pressure would be mounted against South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. U.S. troops were ordered to be ready to move into Laos. A helicopter air base was established in Thailand. Supplies and ammunition were stocked at forward bases along the Mekong River. And the task force on Okinawa, specially trained for combat in Southeast Asia, was put on alert. In addition, the Seventh Fleet was sent to the Gulf of Siam. On 23 March Kennedy held a televised news conference in which he warned that USSR and North Vietnam support of the Pathet Lao increased the probability of war, and that the shape of the necessary response would be carefully considered by the U.S. and its SEATO allies. At the same time Kennedy supported U.K. proposals for a joint U.S.-USSR appeal for a cease-fire followed by an international conference on Laos.  The situation in Laos deteriorated during April. On the l0th the advance of Pathet Lao forces toward the Mekong River threatened to divide Laos, triggering a crisis for Thailand. Thai troops were sent to the areas bordering Laos. On the 20th, when communist forces advanced to within 10 miles of Takhek, the Thai prime minister declared that the Thai army was ready to go into action immediately if Takhek were attacked. On 28 April some token U.S. forces were ordered into Laos, and the (military) advisors serving in Laos were ordered into uniform and sent into battle with the Laotians. Impressed by the persistence of U.S. resolve, the USSR agreed to cosponsor the U.K. proposal on 24 April. The U.K. served as an important intermediary between the U.S. and the USSR in the crisis, a role which was influential in re-instituting the International Control Commission (ICC) and bringing about a negotiated cease-fire. On 3 May a cease-fire between the Laotian government and the Pathet Lao went into effect. And on 16 May the Geneva Conference on Laos opened, terminating the crisis for both the U.S. and Thailand. The ICC would monitor the cease-fire.  The SEATO Council met on 27 March at the request of the U.S. A communiqué was issued stating that, if peaceful efforts failed, SEATO would take appropriate action. Another session was held on 29 April, and a resolution was passed supporting U.S.-USSR proposals for a cease-fire.  The UN was not involved.
Cuba and the United States were the adversaries in a crisis from 15 to 24 April 1961. A series of incursions into Caribbean and Central American states, in which Cuba was perceived to be involved, took place in 1959-60 (see Cases #170--Central America/Cuba I and #178--Central America/Cuba II, in Americas: Non-PCs). In addition, the U.S. had become increasingly concerned about the strong ties that had developed between Cuba and the USSR. Relations between the U.S. and Cuba were strained; and the latter appealed to the Security Council at the end of 1960 charging the U.S. with plans to mount an invasion of Cuba using Cuban exiles trained in Guatemala. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken on 3 January 1961. In early April 1961 President Kennedy authorized an invasion of Cuba by the exiles, reasoning that, in the event of a failure, the remaining force would be able to establish guerrilla bases in the Cuban mountains. Support, or nonobjection to the invasion plans, was given to Kennedy by the CIA, the Defense Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States. On 15 April 1961 Cuban military and civilian centers were bombed by exiles flying U.S.-provided B-26 aircraft, triggering a crisis for Cuba. The U.S. crisis was triggered the same day when Cuba, at a meeting of the UN General Assembly, charged it with complicity in planning and financing the air attack. On the 17th Cuba responded with a declaration of a state of "national alert," an order to Cubans to fight, and a second appeal to the General Assembly charging the U.S. with aggression. While the United States ambassador to the UN denied the charge, the U.S. proceeded with support for the invasion on 18 April by an anti-Castro force made up of Cuban exiles.  A Note from the USSR to the U.S. on 18 April warned of a possible chain reaction to all parts of the globe arising from the invasion and reasserted Soviet support to Cuba to repel the attack. The U.S. responded that day through President Kennedy's answer to the Soviets: Kennedy emphasized that the U.S. "intends no military intervention" in Cuba, but would act to protect the hemisphere in case of military intervention by an outside force. The crisis ended for Cuba on 19 April when it defeated the invading force whose remnants were unable to escape to the mountains. It ended for the U.S. on the 24th when, reversing earlier disclaimers of U.S. involvement, the White House issued a statement by Kennedy assuming direct responsibility for the events leading to the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A weak resolution was passed by the General Assembly calling upon all members to take action to reduce tensions.  (U.S./Cuba relations continued to deteriorate, the latter being supplied with weapons by the Soviet Union. In 1962 the much graver crisis over missiles in Cuba occurred [see Case #196].)
The ongoing territorial conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalated to crisis proportions again from 19 May 1961 to 29 January 1962. Another crisis for Pakistan was generated by reports on 19 May 1961 of a violent infiltration by 1,000 Afghan troops into its territory. Two days later the Pakistan air force bombed areas along the border that it claimed were illegally occupied by Afghan troops. This claim was categorically denied by an Afghanistan embassy spokesman in Karachi. On 23 August 1961, in a note to the Afghanistan government, Pakistan's foreign ministry demanded the closure of Afghan consulates and trade agencies in Pakistan, which it claimed were being used for anti-Pakistani and other subversive activities. This triggered a crisis for Afghanistan. Kabul responded on 30 August that it would consider diplomatic relations as broken unless Pakistan withdrew its demands. Pakistan replied on 2 September by issuing a White Paper claiming that Afghanistan's policy of "expansionism" was the main cause of the hostilities. Diplomatic relations were severed on the 6th.  U.S. and U.K. efforts in October to settle the dispute did not bear fruit immediately. In mid October 1961 President Kennedy's special envoy, L. T. Merchant, traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan as a representative from the U.S. to begin mediation, which ended unsuccessfully on 7 November 1961. However, on 29 January 1962 Merchant succeeded in making possible the delivery of goods from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and the frontier was temporarily reopened, ending the crisis for both actors. During the crisis the Soviet Union supplied economic aid and weapons to Afghanistan. The UN remained aloof from this crisis.  (Diplomatic relations between the adversaries were not reestablished until 24 January 1964.)
Iraq, Kuwait, and the U.K. were the direct participants in a crisis over Kuwait's independence from 19 June until 13 July 1961. Kuwait was granted its independence by the U.K. on 19 June 1961, accompanied by a mutual defense treaty. This triggered a crisis for Iraq. On the 25th Prime Minister Qassem vigorously renewed the claim that Kuwait was an integral part of Iraq and threatened action, including violence, to nullify Kuwait's independence. This catalyzed a crisis for Kuwait. Perceiving a threat to its existence, Kuwait responded on the 30th with a formal request to Britain for assistance under the provisions of their defense agreement. This in turn generated a crisis for the U.K. On 1 July it began a rapid military buildup in Kuwait: within one week British forces numbered 6,000.  The same day Kuwait appealed to the UN Security Council. The Council discussed the matter; but a draft resolution critical of Iraq was vetoed by the USSR. Moreover, Egypt's proposal for the withdrawal of British troops did not secure a Security Council majority. In July 1961 the Arab League admitted Kuwait to membership in the face of Iraq's protests and established a Pan-Arab force of mostly Jordanians and Sa'udi Arabians to defend Kuwait.  The Kuwait Independence crisis ended on 13 July when Iraq's military attaché in the U.K. denied that Iraq intended to attack Kuwait or that it had concentrated troops on the border.  The U.S. was not involved in this crisis.  (With recognition by the Arab world the emir of Kuwait requested British troops to leave; the evacuation was completed by October 1961. After the downfall of General Qassem in February 1963 Iraq recognized Kuwait's independence--but not the finality of the Iraq/Kuwait border. [This was to remain a source of persistent tension and was a precipitating cause of the Gulf crisis-war in 1990-91--see Case #393.] Iraq, which had boycotted the Arab League after its admission of Kuwait, withdrew its claim to all of Kuwait in the autumn of 1963.  On 10 November 1994, for the first time, Iraq formally recognized Kuwait's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its borders as demarcated after the 1991 war. This was in accord with a UN Security Council resolution during the October 1994 Iraq Troop Deployment--Kuwait crisis [see Case #412].)
There were two actors in this crisis, France and Tunisia. It began on 17 July and ended on 29 September 1961. France continued to maintain a number of military bases in its former colony of Tunisia after Tunisia's independence in 1956. This caused tense relations which reached crisis proportions in 1957-58 (see Case #158). As a result France reduced its military presence to one large base at Bizerta. In spite of a vague promise by President de Gaulle to President Bourguiba that France would evacuate the base, the French began construction in July 1961 of an additional runway designed to increase its military capability. On 17 July Bourguiba triggered a crisis for France when he issued an ultimatum giving the French approximately 48 hours to open negotiations on a timetable for withdrawal from Bizerta, or face a Tunisian-imposed blockade. France's response was a decision on the 18th to take military action; and on the 19th, when the Tunisians tried to block a French attempt to resupply the base, French paratroops and other forces launched a military assault against Tunisian positions, triggering a crisis for Tunisia.  Tunisia's response was multiple: on 20 July it appealed to the UN Security Council and also attempted to meet French violence with violence of its own. France was condemned in resolutions by the Security Council and the General Assembly. An Arab League resolution was also passed authorizing action by member-states in the form of volunteer military forces for Tunisia. However, none of these contributed to the abatement of the Bizerta crisis. The crisis ended on 29 September with an agreement between France and Tunisia that restored the status quo prior to Bourguiba's ultimatum. (After lengthy negotiations, France evacuated its base at Bizerta on 15 October 1963.)  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
The last Cold War crisis over Berlin was of direct concern to six actors: the DDR (East Germany), the USSR, France, the U.K., the FRG (West Germany), and the U.S. It began early in August and ended on 28 October 1961. Soon after the end of World War II in Europe the U.S., the U.K., and France became parties to an uneasy agreement with the Soviet Union regarding the administration of Germany and its capital, Berlin: the Potsdam Agreement of 2 August 1945 partitioned Berlin (and Germany) into four zones of occupation; an Allied Control Council, representing the Four Powers, was to serve as an overall supervisory body. Acute crises between the Western powers and the Soviet Union occurred in 1948-49 and 1958-59 (see Cases #123--Berlin Blockade, and #168--Berlin Deadline). (The East German Uprising [see Case #141, in Europe: Non-PCs] was an intra-Soviet-bloc crisis.) In October 1960 the Soviet leader, Khrushchev, after canceling the Paris summit meeting with President Eisenhower over the U-2 affair, set the end of 1961 as the deadline for the signing of a German peace treaty, in the absence of which the USSR would sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. President Kennedy's meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna on 3-4 June 1961 made no progress on Berlin. On returning to Moscow, Khrushchev repeated his ultimatum, while Kennedy announced to the American people that the U.S. would fight to defend its rights in Berlin and the freedom of West Berliners. He also called up military reserve units. A crisis for the DDR and the USSR crystallized at the beginning of August 1961: by that time the flow of East German refugees to the West had reached alarming proportions--100,000 during the first half of the year, including 20,000 in June, which rose to 30,000 in July. Under growing pressure from the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, and the specter of an impending collapse of communist power in the DDR, Khrushchev, just before a Communist-bloc summit meeting in Moscow on 3-5 August, authorized Ulbricht to erect a wall around West Berlin. The implementation of this decision on 13 August was the major response to the crisis by the USSR and the DDR. It, in turn, triggered a crisis for France, the U.K., West Germany, and the U.S. And it terminated East Germany's crisis because the wall ended the flow of refugees to the West.  West Germany responded on 16 August with a call from West Berlin's Mayor Willy Brandt to the West for effective action. An emergency session of the FRG parliament was held the next day. On the 17th and 18th the U.S., the U.K., and France responded by strengthening the Berlin garrison--1,500 U.S. troops were rushed to the city. On 22 August DDR forces announced the establishment of a no-man's land of 100 meters on each side of the Wall. West Berliners were warned to keep clear of that zone. Western forces began to patrol the area to the west while East German forces kept watch over their side.  The crisis ended for France, the U.K., and West Germany on 17 October when Khrushchev, at the Soviet 22nd Party Congress, withdrew his year-end deadline for the signing of a German peace treaty.  For the two superpowers the crisis lingered on another 11 days. A brief but ominous confrontation between U.S. and Soviet tanks from 25 to 28 October at "Checkpoint Charlie," the crossing point between the U.S. and the USSR sectors of Berlin, re-escalated the interbloc crisis. United States leaders perceived this incident as a test of U.S. resolve that was met successfully. Soviet leaders perceived it as a Western threat to penetrate the Wall and East Berlin. It was resolved by a tacit agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev on 28 October for a parallel withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet tanks from a potentially dangerous violent clash.  Both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO) were active in the crisis, each backing its own protagonists in the dispute. The UN was not involved in this crisis.  (The Western Allies and West Germany failed to demolish the Wall--that occurred spontaneously within East Germany in 1989; but they remained steadfast in maintaining their presence in Berlin. This resolve was communicated dramatically to the people of West Berlin by President Kennedy in his memorable "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech during his August 1963 visit to the city. A Four-Power agreement in 1971 stabilized the Berlin status quo for almost two decades. The conflict over Berlin remained unsolved until the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990.  The Soviet [and, after 1991, Russian] military presence in East Germany and Berlin lasted 49 years. More than half a million Russian troops and dependents were evacuated from 1991 to 1994. And the final symbolic withdrawal of the Four Powers' military contingents from Berlin occurred in August-September 1994.)
A crisis for South Vietnam and the United States took place from 18 September to 15 November 1961. For several years prior to this crisis Vietcong groups, backed by the North Vietnam regime, had been brought together for attacks on civilian and military centers in South Vietnam. By September 1961 these attacks had trebled in number. Vietcong guerrilla forces were situated in the northern marshlands of South Vietnam. When approached by South Vietnam government forces, they disappeared across the border into North Vietnam making their capture extremely difficult. A crisis for South Vietnam and the United States was triggered on 18 September 1961 when Phuoc Vinh, the provincial capital of Phuoc Thanh, only 55 miles from Saigon, was captured and held for a day by the Vietcong. Before government troops arrived, the provincial governor was publicly beheaded, and arms and ammunition were captured and removed. This attack had a shattering effect on the South Vietnam regime, despite the quick success in forcing the Vietcong to retreat. The United States, whose influence in Southeast Asia had been threatened by North Vietnam and, therefore, Soviet gains, was reluctant to increase its commitment to the area.  In view of the dangerously deteriorating security situation South Vietnam President Diem responded on 29 September by requesting a bilateral defense treaty with the United States. On 11 October President Kennedy and his advisors decided to send National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and General Maxwell Taylor to Vietnam to assess the political and military feasibility of U.S. intervention. A state of emergency was proclaimed in South Vietnam on 19 October.  In a report to the U.S. president on 3 November Rostow and Taylor recommended a significant expansion of U.S. aid to South Vietnam, as well as the dispatch of an 8,000-person logistical task force. On 11 November a joint recommendation from the Secretaries of State and Defense (Rusk and McNamara) to the president stated that a decision to commit ground forces in South Vietnam could be deferred. The U.S. major response, on 15 November, was a National Security Council decision for a limited commitment of aid and advisors to South Vietnam--several hundred specialists in guerrilla warfare, logistics, communication, and engineering--to train South Vietnam forces. Aircraft and other special equipment would be sent as well. That decision ended the crisis for the U.S. and South Vietnam.  The Rostow-Taylor trip to South Vietnam was assailed by Moscow and North Vietnam as a prelude to U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. On the regional level, SEATO's military advisors met from 3-6 October and issued a communiqué on the 6th to the effect that practical measures were being taken to increase the effectiveness of SEATO defenses.  The UN was not involved.
Indonesia and the Netherlands experienced a second crisis over this territorial residue of the struggle for independence. It began on 26 September 1961 and ended on 15 August 1962. Following an Indonesian decision to "liberate" West Irian, President Sukarno appealed to the USSR for political and military support, which was granted. A new Dutch plan was designed stressing the idea of self-determination for the Papuans. A crisis for Indonesia began on 26 September 1961 when the Dutch foreign minister submitted a proposal to the UN for the decolonization of West Irian and the transfer of sovereignty to its people, with the UN assuming its administration temporarily. Indonesia, which viewed the proposal as a means of consolidating Dutch administration and thus keeping Indonesia out of West Irian indefinitely, responded on 19 December 1961 by inaugurating a triple command for the "liberation" of New Guinea, along with general mobilization. In order to focus world attention, a small-scale infiltration into West Irian was initiated. This triggered a crisis for the Netherlands.  Active participation by the UN Secretary-General and an announcement by President Kennedy of the U.S.'s intention to seek a solution persuaded the Netherlands to respond on 3 January 1962: it announced its decision of the previous day to drop the demand that Indonesia accept the principle of self-determination for the Papuans as a condition for negotiations. Once the U.S. had abandoned its neutral position for a policy of active mediation, a solution—brokered by U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, acting as the UN Secretary-General's personal representative--became possible. Bunker’s mediation efforts began with discussions with Dutch and Indonesian representatives on 20 March, near Washington, D.C. The next few months saw the negotiations proceed with initial success and then stall. Bunker played an important role in proposing possible agreements and keeping the parties negotiating. Largely as a result of Bunker’s persistent mediation, Indonesia and the Netherlands finally reached an agreement on 15 August 1962, the termination date of the crisis. Under the terms of the agreement, the UN would supervise the evacuation of Dutch military forces and take over administration of the area until it was handed over to Indonesia no later than 1 May 1963.  The USSR was only peripherally involved, as it supplied arms to Indonesia.
The duration of Egypt's crisis was from 28 September to 5 October 1961. A number of high-ranking right-wing Syrian officers in the army of the United Arab Republic formed an alliance with civilian politicians connected with the Syrian business class. Secret talks were held between these Syrians and Nasir's representative, Vice President Field Marshal 'Amer, where strong dissatisfaction with the UAR was expressed. A coup in Syria on the night of 27-28 September 1961 triggered a crisis for Egypt on the 28th. The restoration of Syria's independence was demanded, and this was viewed by Nasir as a threat directed at Egypt's influence in the Middle East subsystem. Nasir immediately ordered the UAR armed forces to suppress the rebellion. Two thousand paratroops supported the First Army, followed by the entire UAR navy and more troop reinforcements in ships. The following day, the ports of Aleppo and Latakia were taken by the rebels. When Nasir learned this, he ordered the ships to turn back arguing that the reconquest of Syria was almost impossible unless a substantial part of the Syrian army remained loyal to the UAR. Egypt's primary crisis management technique was negotiations with Syrian leaders, but Cairo was unable to persuade them to continue Syria's merger with Egypt. The crisis terminated on 5 October when the end of the Union was admitted to have taken place. Nasir announced that he would not oppose the application of the new Syrian regime for readmission into the United Nations and the Arab League.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (After the termination of the crisis, on 9 and 10 October, respectively, the USSR and the U.S. recognized the new regime in Syria.)
Another crisis for Finland vis-à-vis the USSR occurred between 30 October and 24 November 1961. Cold war tensions resulting from the erection of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 (see Case #185, in Multiregional PCs: East/West) and the breakdown of disarmament talks in September contributed to Soviet concern about the January 1962 presidential and parliamentary elections in Finland. Five coalition parties had united to back the candidacy of Olair Honka for president and presented a serious challenge to incumbent President Kekkonen. The Soviets perceived the possibility of Kekkonen's defeat as a political threat that would affect Finland's neutrality and its general pro-Soviet foreign policy. Finland, always sensitive to the wishes of its giant neighbor, perceived a military threat from the Soviet Union if it deviated too much from previous policy. On 30 October 1961 a Note was sent by the Soviet Union to Finland calling for consultations between the two governments "to ensure the defense of both countries from the threat of a military attack by Western Germany and allied states." The Finnish response, on 7 November, was a decision to send Foreign Minister Karzalaimen for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. Further negotiations between Kekkonen and Khrushchev resulted in the termination of the crisis on 24 November 1961, postponing military consultations between the two countries.  There was no UN involvement in this crisis.  (In 1962 Kekkonen was re-elected to the presidency.)
A second crisis for Portugal over Goa lasted from 11 to 19 December 1961. There had been relative inactivity since Portugal's first crisis with India over Goa in 1955 (see Case #151). In April 1961 a bill was passed by the Indian Parliament enabling the merger of Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the Indian Union. During the debate Nehru stated that he did not rule out sending the Indian army into Goa. He repeated this warning in October. Meanwhile, Indian public opinion began demanding that more active steps be taken toward the integration of Goa. Tension between India and Portugal escalated with the reported buildup of Portuguese military strength in Goa, and, on 17 and 24 November, Indian ships were shot at from the Portuguese island of Anjadev. India announced, on 5 December, that precautionary troop movements were taking place. On 8 December Portugal charged that the Indian buildup threatened peace in the area and suggested that international observers be sent. Portugal appealed to the UN Security Council on 9 December. Portugal's crisis was triggered by a Nehru statement on 11 December that Indian patience was at an end and that he hoped the Portuguese would withdraw from Goa and the two smaller Portuguese enclaves, Damas and Diu. Portugal responded the same day by informing the UN Security Council that Indian forces were massing along the border and were ready to invade Goa.  On 12 December Portugal announced that it had decided to evacuate European women and children from the disputed area in view of an imminent Indian attack: information received by Portugal anticipated an attack on 15 December. On that day UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a message to the prime ministers of India and Portugal requesting them not to allow the situation to deteriorate and proposing negotiations. Salazar acceded to the Secretary-General's request, but Nehru replied with a demand that Portugal leave Goa.  On 18 December 1961 Indian troops entered Goa. Portugal called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council. A resolution was introduced by Portugal's Western allies calling for a cease-fire, Indian withdrawal, and a peaceful settlement but it was defeated by a Soviet veto. The United States strongly criticized India's action. President Kennedy sent a message to Nehru urging that no force be used--U.S. ambassadors to Delhi and Lisbon had succeeded in postponing the invasion date a number of times.  The crisis for Portugal ended on 19 December 1961 with the entry of Indian troops and the signing of a surrender agreement ending four centuries of Portuguese rule over Goa.
A crisis for Mauritania lasted from 29 March 1962 to 18 February 1963. The border between Mauritania and Mali had been the subject of dispute since 1944. Nomadic tribes from both states crossed back and forth over the border. Prior to the independence of both countries, in 1960, conferences on future boundaries were held, but immediately after independence relations between the two states deteriorated. Guerrillas, thought to be organized by Morocco and based in Mali, carried out actions in Mauritania: there were several attempted assassinations of Mauritanian officials as well. In early 1962 Mauritania changed its position on the border question, successfully overcoming internal Moroccan-supported opposition. On 29 March 1962 six people were accused of murdering French officers at Nama in eastern Mauritania, triggering a crisis for that state. Mali was accused of harboring a Moroccan terrorist group that aimed at ridding Mauritania of the French in order to facilitate Moroccan territorial claims in the area. The response, on 6 April, was a presidential declaration that Mauritania would not allow any attempt against the integrity of the country. On 7 June 1962 the Mauritanian UN representative charged that Moroccan terrorists, trained in bases in Mali, had raided border outposts in his country.  A political settlement was reached by the presidents of the two countries at Kayes, Mali, on 18 February 1963 ending the crisis. The nationals of both states were guaranteed nomadic rights and the use of wells in disputed areas. Compromise agreements were reached, although Mali gained more territory than Mauritania.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
The PRC was the sole crisis actor. This crisis lasted from 22 April to 27 June 1962. During the three years before this crisis there had been agricultural disasters and a significant shortage in consumer goods on the Chinese mainland. There was a mass exodus of Chinese across the borders; from Sinkiang into Soviet Central Asia and from Kwangtung into Hong Kong. In addition, during the period preceding the crisis there was tension along China's border with India (see Case #194--China/India Border II, in 1962-63, in Asia: Non-PCs).  Beginning in January 1962, a series of bellicose statements by senior Nationalist officials alerted decision makers in the PRC that Chiang Kai-shek might be preparing an invasion of the mainland. The trigger for the PRC's crisis was an Easter message by Chiang Kai-shek to his people on 22 April 1962, which contained threats to invade the mainland. This was followed by a conscription of additional manpower to Taiwan's army. On 1 May a special new tax was imposed in order to support the "return to the mainland." Further, from 22 May more Nationalist statements were issued indicating plans for an invasion. On 29 May the PRC's Foreign Minister, Ch'en Yi, divulged the existence of specially trained agents who, together with anti-communist elements on the mainland, would join forces if a decision were made by Chiang Kai-shek to drop paratroops into Communist China. Ch'en Yi intimated that there would be U.S. support for this venture.  Alarmed by the possibility of U.S. intervention, the response of the PRC was a considerable troop buildup in Fukien Province beginning on 10 June. On 23 June a meeting was held between U.S. and PRC ambassadors in Warsaw, where U.S. Ambassador John Cabot denied that the U.S. would actively support a Taiwan invasion. On 27 June President Kennedy, at a news conference, reiterated U.S. policy: the U.S. would defend Taiwan against a PRC threat, but its policy was peaceful and defensive only. This was an indirect assurance that the U.S. would not support a Taiwanese attempt to invade the mainland. That statement marked a unilateral conclusion to the third Taiwan crisis.  Neither the UN nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.  (There was no full-scale international crisis between the PRC and Taiwan for more than three decades. However, the protracted conflict between the two China regimes erupted periodically--usually in the form of a Beijing-perceived threat from Taipei, supported by the U.S., to thwart the PRC's persistent claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, by reactivating the "Two Chinas" policy, renounced by the U.S. in 1971. The most recent crisis [Taiwan Strait IV in this PC] was triggered by a U.S.-permitted private visit of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to the United States in May 1995. China responded to this hostile act by doing the following: withdrawing its ambassador from Washington for five months, suspending high-level official visits, and holding show-of-force naval maneuvers near Taiwan in the summer and autumn of 1995. The PRC renewed its military pressure on Taiwan in February-March 1996, more intensely, and with even higher visibility; but, as in the summer of 1995, there was no violence between the adversaries. All these acts signaled--to Taiwan and the U.S.--the PRC's determination to reintegrate Taiwan into China, preferably by negotiation, but by force if necessary.)
The duration of this second Pathet Lao crisis for Thailand and the United States was from 6 May to 12 June 1962. Following the cease-fire of May 1961, talks in Geneva began on the problem of Laos. Negotiations proceeded slowly, with such issues as the seating of the Pathet Lao delegation as a full representative and frequent violations of the cease-fire threatening the continuation of the talks in general. The Kennedy/Khrushchev meeting in Vienna on 3-4 June 1961 resulted in a joint statement calling for a neutralized Laos and an effective cease-fire. Difficulties among the three Laotian factions--pro-communist, pro-West, nonaligned--prevented the forming of a coalition government. Negotiations reached a deadlock in early 1962. This was followed by an increased Pathet Lao military presence in the Nam Tha area bordering Thailand. In February Pathet Lao forces, with Vietminh support, began a siege of the capital of Nam Tha. On 13 February Thai troops were deployed to strategic areas near the Laotian border. At a news conference the following day President Kennedy expressed concern about the situation. By the end of April there was no progress in the negotiations, and new fighting had broken out. A crisis for Thailand and the United States was triggered on 6 May 1962 when a heavy Pathet Lao attack was launched against Nam Tha. Laos government forces retreated without resistance across the Mekong River into Thai territory, abandoning northwest Laos to the Pathet Lao and thereby opening the way for them to move to the northern border of Thailand. On 11 May Thailand's Prime Minister Sarit ordered several units of the Thai armed forces to reinforce defenses along the border with Laos. The United States' response, on 12 May, was an order by President Kennedy to send the Seventh Fleet to the Gulf of Siam and to put U.S. armed forces elsewhere in the Pacific and at home on standby alert. At the request of the Thai government 1,000 U.S. marines, in Thailand for SEATO exercises, were moved to the Laotian border on 14 May. On the 15th Kennedy announced that 4,000 more U.S. troops had been ordered into Thailand to protect its territorial integrity. The U.S. deployment put a stop to the Pathet Lao drive, and political pressure was successful in reopening negotiations.  The crisis ended on 12 June 1962 for both actors when the three Laotian princes (Souvanna Phouma, Boum Oum, and Souphanouvong) signed an agreement on their participation in a "Government of National Union," indicating a tacit understanding between Thailand and the U.S., on the one hand, and North Vietnam, on the other.  An emergency meeting of the SEATO Council requested that members send token military forces to Thailand on 16 May: all agreed, with the exception of France. The USSR's involvement was political: Ambassador Dobrynin and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk met on 15 May and agreed on the need to maintain the cease-fire and establish a neutral and independent Laos. The USSR condemned the movement of U.S. troops to Thailand as aggression. There was no UN involvement.
A second border crisis between India and China, leading to full-scale war, began on 8 September 1962 and ended on 23 January 1963. Border clashes between India and China erupted into an international crisis in August 1959 (see Case #171--China/India Border I). From 1960 to 1962 the dispute continued at a lower level of intensity until Chinese forces began to take control of more disputed territory in the Aksai Chin region, in the western sector. India demanded a return to the status quo ante as a condition for negotiations. The PRC refused and began to concentrate military forces on the northeast (NEFA) border. India continued with its "Forward Policy" in which military patrols attempted to establish posts in territories held or claimed by the Chinese. On 8 September 1962 Chinese forces crossed the Thag La Ridge on the McMahon Line, triggering India's perception of a threat to its territorial integrity, with a limited time to respond militarily due to the imminent approach of winter.  The following day India began to plan "Operation Leghorn" to bring about the eviction of the Chinese. The beginning of its implementation on 4 October triggered a crisis for China, which perceived an imminent Indian military campaign beyond border incidents. On the same day China informed the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Beijing of India's plans. The PRC responded on 20 October with a massive simultaneous attack on the western and eastern sectors of the disputed frontier. That day Nehru received a letter from Khrushchev expressing concern at reports that India intended to settle the dispute militarily, warning of the inherent dangers and urging India to accept the Chinese proposals for talks. India's major response, on 24 October, was to take up the military option and to reject the PRC suggestion for mutual withdrawal to the 7 November 1959 "line of actual control," which would leave China in control of large tracts of disputed territory. On 29 October the U.S. ambassador in New Delhi offered U.S. military aid to India. So too did the U.K.  An intrawar crisis for India was triggered on 16 November with a second Chinese offensive. On the 19th Nehru appealed to President Kennedy to dispatch immediately 15 bomber and fighter squadrons to provide air cover for Indian cities against an anticipated Chinese attack. A U.S. aircraft carrier was ordered to leave its base in the Pacific and head toward the Bay of Bengal. Shortly thereafter the defeat of the Indian army was completed.  The crisis ended for China on 21 November when the PRC announced a unilateral cease-fire and, from 1 December, a withdrawal of Chinese forces 20 kilometers behind the actual control lines of 7 November 1959, in both the Aksai Chin (western sector) and the McMahon Line (eastern sector). That withdrawal date terminated India's IWC--but not yet its crisis as a whole.  Six Asian and African nonaligned states (Burma, Ceylon [Sri Lanka], Indonesia, Cambodia, Ghana, and the UAR [Egypt]) attempted mediation at the Colombo Conference during 10-12 December 1962. Sirimavo Ratwatte Bandaranaike, Prime Minister of Ceylon, led the mediation team’s efforts. By the time India's Lok Sabha approved their proposals, on 23 January, the PRC had implemented its unilateral withdrawal, a de facto cease-fire was in place, and the crisis ended for India.  Australia, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. sent aircraft and other military equipment to India. The USSR and Pakistan were peripherally involved.  (On 29 November 1996, 34 years after their border war, the presidents of India and China renounced the use of force to solve their territorial dispute, by pledging that "neither side shall use its military capability against the other."  They also announced an agreement in principle on mutual withdrawal of forces from disputed areas along their 2,500 mile frontier, though details were deferred to further negotiations. It was a step toward resolution of the conflict between the world's two most populous states but less than final termination.)  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
The four actors in the first phase of the long Yemen War were Jordan, Sa'udi Arabia, Egypt, and Yemen. This crisis lasted from 26 September 1962 to 15 April 1963. The coup in Yemen on 26 September triggered a crisis for Jordan and Sa'udi Arabia. Both feared the possibility that the fall of the monarchy in Yemen would spread to their own kingdoms. They responded on 1 October with a delivery of arms to the Royalists led by the former imam. This triggered a crisis for Egypt and the YAR. On 4 October the Republican regime ordered general mobilization. Egypt, after sending a team to observe the situation on 13 October, decided to dispatch several thousand troops to Yemen by mid-November. Civil war broke out between the Republicans, aided by Egypt, and the Royalists, aided by arms and men from Jordan and Sa'udi Arabia. On 4 November Mecca Radio announced that Egyptian aircraft had attacked five Sa'udi villages. That day, too, a military alliance between Jordan and Sa'udi Arabia was made known. On the l0th a Joint Defense Pact between Yemen and Egypt was signed. Following the Egyptian raids on Sa'udi Arabia, a Sa'udi decision was made to carry out reprisal raids against the YAR. When the Republican government got word of this (via Jordanian officers who fled to Egypt), they warned of air attacks on the two countries. The U.S. reacted by sending a warship to Jiddah as a warning against further Yemeni or Egyptian attacks on Sa'udi Arabia. Word was also given to Yemen that, in the event of an attack by the two states, all U.S. military aircraft would be withdrawn and the United States would adopt a neutral attitude. President Kennedy offered his good offices to bring about a peaceful solution and announced U.S. recognition of the Republican government on 19 December. Further Egyptian bombing of Sa'udi Arabia resulted in a Sa'udi call for general mobilization. Ralph Bunche, UN Under-Secretary-General for Special Political Affairs, visited Yemen from 1 to 4 March on a fact-finding mission on behalf of Secretary-General U Thant. Bunche’s mission proved important because the primary mediator for this crisis, former U.S. Ambassador to India Ellsworth T. Bunker, was not allowed in Yemen. Bunker presented a proposal for agreement on disengagement between Saudi Arabia and Egypt on 10 April 1963 and, through shuttle diplomacy, secured the agreement. On 15 April 1963 Jordan recognized the YAR and withdrew from the war. A cease-fire and disengagement agreement signed that day marked the end of this crisis and the first phase of the Yemen War. The USSR provided economic assistance to the YAR and, indirectly, through Egypt, military aid.
There were three crisis actors in the most ominous of all East/West crises, the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. The crisis lasted from 16 October to 20 November 1962. After the 1961 Bay of Pigs abortive invasion (see Case #181), Cuba became one of the central issues of U.S. foreign policy: the U.S. viewed Cuba as a potential source of communist-oriented subversive activities in Latin America. When the U.S. discovered the presence of Soviet military personnel in Cuba on 7 September 1962 it called up 150,000 reservists. The Soviets mobilized on the 11th. Although persistent rumors circulated concerning the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin denied the charges, and Premier Khrushchev gave his personal assurances that ground-to-ground missiles would never be shipped to Cuba. On the eve of the Missile crisis Washington did not openly challenge the Soviet statements concerning the defensive character of the weapons being sent to Cuba. The U.S. crisis was triggered on 16 October when the CIA presented to President Kennedy photographic evidence of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The U.S. responded with a decision on the 20th to blockade all offensive military equipment en route to Cuba. When this was announced on 22 October, a crisis was triggered for Cuba and the USSR. An urgent meeting of the UN Security Council was requested by both the U.S. and Cuba on the 22nd, and by the USSR the next day. On the 23rd as well, the Soviets accused the United States of violating the UN Charter and announced an alert of its armed forces and those of the Warsaw Pact members. That day Cuba responded by condemning the U.S. blockade and declaring its willingness to fight.  A resolution was adopted on the 23rd by the OAS calling for the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba and recommending that member-states take all measures, including the use of force, to ensure that the government of Cuba would not continue to receive military material. On 24 October the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to confer with the parties. On that same day, U Thant began mediation by sending identical letters to Khrushchev and Kennedy which proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States enter into negotiations, during which period both the shipment of arms and the quarantine would be suspended.  Moscow's major response to the crisis was a letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on 26 October offering the removal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba and the cessation of further shipments in exchange for an end to the U.S. quarantine and a U.S. assurance that it would not invade Cuba. The situation was exacerbated on the 27th when a U.S. U-2 surveillance plane was shot down. That day another Khrushchev letter was received in Washington offering the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. U.S. mobilization and aerial reconnaissance flights were stepped up. And on the 27th President Kennedy sent the Soviet premier an acceptance of the proposals contained in the letter of 26 October while making no reference to Khrushchev's second letter of the 27th. The following day Khrushchev notified the U.S. government that he had ordered work on the missile sites in Cuba stopped. He agreed to ship the missiles back to the USSR and promised that UN observers would be allowed to verify the dismantling of the sites. At the same time he warned Washington that U-2 reconnaissance flights over Cuba must be stopped as well.  The crisis continued at a lower level of intensity for several more weeks due to Cuban President Castro's demands concerning a U.S. pledge not to invade his country. On 30 October U Thant began talks in Havana, and Kennedy agreed to lift the quarantine for the duration of the talks. When Cuba rejected UN inspection, the U.S. resumed the quarantine and air surveillance.  The Kremlin sent Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba on 2 November to try to persuade Castro to allow UN inspection. When this proved unsuccessful, a U.S.-USSR agreement was reached on 7 November allowing U.S. inspection and interception of Soviet ships leaving Cuba and the photographing of the missiles. The following day the superpowers negotiated the removal of the IL-28 bombers which Castro had claimed were Cuban property. Castro's agreement was conveyed to the U.S. on 20 November 1962, which terminated the Missile crisis for all three actors. The U.S. naval quarantine was lifted immediately, but aerial surveillance continued until the agreement was completely carried out.  U Thant’s mediation efforts had an important impact on crisis resolution. The acting Secretary-General managed to act as a facilitator and kept lines of communication open by contacting both parties. He also used formulative mediation by highlighting common interests and making substantive suggestions to both sides for diffusing the crisis. Overall, U Thant’s mediation effort was a significant factor in easing tensions between crisis actors which contributed to a more rapid termination of the crisis.  Three regional/security organizations were involved in this crisis--the OAS, NATO, and the WTO. Kennedy sent Dean Acheson to Paris on 23 October to brief NATO's Permanent Council on U.S. measures against Cuba. Involved were members of the Warsaw Pact, whose forces were put on alert, and Latin American states which offered military assistance to the U.S.
Malaysia (then Malaya) and Indonesia were crisis actors over the issue of the Malaysia Federation from 11 February 1963 until 9 August 1965. Malaya became an independent member of the (British) Commonwealth on 31 August 1957. Throughout the 1950s Great Britain attempted to create a viable political structure for its Southeast Asia colonies, to include Brunei, Malaya, Sabah (British Borneo), Sarawak, and Singapore. Plans for a Federation of Malaysia among these five political entities--an agreement was signed on 31 July 1962--conflicted with territorial claims of Indonesia and the Philippines. Hostility was first expressed in December 1962, when Indonesia covertly backed a revolt in Brunei for independence from the U.K. The rebellion was quelled within 10 days. Following this revolt, Indonesia's support became more open. The trigger to Malaya's crisis was President Sukarno's declaration on 11 February 1963 that Indonesia strongly opposed a Malaysia federation. Malaya responded two days later by announcing an immediate expansion of its armed forces. Talks between the U.K. and the five participating entities resulted in an agreement in London on 9 July 1963 for the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, which was signed by all except Brunei. This triggered a crisis for Indonesia. Its response, on 11 July, was a sharp statement of opposition claiming a violation of a 14 June 1963 agreement that a federation would be established only after the UN ascertained the wishes of the people involved. Tension declined on 5 August when a summit conference of Indonesian, Malayan, and Philippine heads of state agreed that the UN would ascertain the views of the people.  Tension was exacerbated on 14 September 1963 with the publication of the results indicating the people's preference for a Malaysia federation. The next day Indonesia declared that it would not recognize the Federation and recalled its ambassador to Kuala Lumpur. Malaya responded on 17 September by severing diplomatic ties with Indonesia and the Philippines. The U.S. suspended economic aid to Indonesia and sent Attorney-General Robert Kennedy to mediate, with little success – Kennedy brokered an ambiguous cease-fire that was not implemented and persuaded both sides to attend future negotiations in Bankok and Tokyo. The International Monetary Fund then withdrew its offer of promised credit. The Soviet Union gave Indonesia only lukewarm political support. China supported Indonesia throughout the crisis.  As the confrontation faded, the crisis eased. Singapore seceded from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, an event that Indonesia viewed as the beginning of the breakup of the Federation, a "face-saver." Malaya, too, perceived a victory because Indonesia's confrontation policy ended without destroying the Federation.  UN involvement was limited to discussion.
The Dominican Republic and Haiti were the actors in a two-phase crisis from 26 April to 3 June 1963. The Dominican Republic's dictator, Trujillo, was assassinated in 1960; and members of his family fled to Haiti. Newly elected President Bosch feared that Trujillo's exiled relatives would try to regain power. An attempt on the lives of the children of Haiti's dictator Duvalier (Papa Doc) aroused suspicions of Dominican Republic complicity: the conspirators had sought refuge in the Dominican Republic embassy in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. On 26 April 1963 Haitian policemen forcibly entered the Dominican Republic embassy and arrested opponents of Haiti's regime. This violation of diplomatic immunity triggered a crisis for the Dominican Republic. The next day President Bosch responded by issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to Haiti that triggered a reciprocal crisis. Bosch also appealed to the OAS and proposed a joint democratic Latin American force to oust Duvalier. On the 28th Haiti severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. The following day the Dominican Republic began stationing troops along its border with Haiti.  An OAS fact-finding mission arrived in Haiti on 30 April. On 5 and 6 May the crisis reached its peak. OAS officials shuttled between the two countries in an attempt at de-escalation. A new OAS five-nation mediation committee was created on the 8th. The mediation efforts of the OAS committee consisted mainly of helping the parties communicate with each other and to save face. The effect of the mediation was only minor compared to the other developments in the crisis.  By 10 May the possibility of a Dominican Republic invasion of Haiti had lessened considerably. On the 14th Duvalier released the hostages, terminating the crisis for the Dominican Republic. This was followed by the demobilization of Dominican Republic forces. On 3 June Haiti's crisis ended with the publication of the final report by the OAS committee, which did not recommend further action against Haiti. The U.S., fearing for the lives of foreign citizens in Haiti, sent a naval task force. This was withdrawn after the final report of the OAS, and normal relations with Haiti were restored.  The UN Security Council met on 8-9 May at Haiti's request and discussed the issue but left action to the regional organization.
A crisis over territory between Algeria and Morocco lasted from 1 October to 4 November 1963. The dispute centered around areas of the Sahara held by Algeria that Morocco claimed had been part of the Moroccan state in precolonial times. Algeria countered that the disputed territory had been administered by the French and was liberated by the Front Liberation National (FLN), along with the rest of Algeria. A long-standing nationalist revolt against French rule in Algeria (1954-62) exacerbated the situation. On 1 October 1963 Algeria's President Ben Bella announced that Moroccan troops had taken up positions in the disputed territory, triggering a crisis for Algeria. Further, he charged that the Moroccans were supplying aid to rebel leader Ait-Ahmad, a former member of the Algerian National Assembly, then controlling the nearby region of Kabylia. Algeria responded on 8 October when its forces clashed with Moroccan troops. This constituted the crisis trigger for Morocco, which subsequently withdrew. On 14 October Morocco responded by reinforcing its troops and reoccupying the lost outposts.  Efforts at negotiation were initiated by Algeria. Morocco, too, called for a peaceful settlement. The Bamako Agreement, a five-part cease-fire, signed on 30 October by both parties, was worked out through the mediation of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie and Mali President Modiba Keita. However, fighting continued for several more days until a Malian officer monitoring the truce succeeded in bringing the fighting to an end on 4 November 1963, terminating the crisis.  In the agreement, Morocco obtained Algeria's consent to an examination of the border problem and an undertaking to cease propaganda attacks. Algeria secured Morocco's withdrawal from the positions it occupied during the fighting and an agreement to settle the dispute within the framework of the OAU. (In February 1964, Morocco withdrew its forces.)  In addition to the OAU, the Arab League was active in the crisis; but neither regional organization contributed to its resolution. (The OAU's role occurred in the later stages of negotiation and reconciliation after the crisis ended.) Cuba and the United Arab Republic (UAR, Egypt) were perceived by Morocco to be partial to Algeria in the dispute.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
The duration of Venezuela's crisis with Cuba was one month, from 1 November to 1 December 1963. During 1963 Venezuela's internal situation began to verge on civil war. There was a marked increase in communist guerrilla attacks on major targets within Caracas itself. President Betancourt had announced emergency legislation against Venezuela's left-wing parties and ordered the arrest of leading communists, following an assassination attempt. Betancourt's drive against the Left on the domestic scene was matched by attempts in his foreign policy to isolate Cuba and invoke OAS sanctions against the Castro regime. This policy was actively encouraged by the U.S. Presidential elections in Venezuela were scheduled for 1 December 1963. On 1 November 1963 the Venezuelan government discovered a significant arms cache on the Paraguana Peninsula, one of Venezuela's quiet, secluded beaches. A plan of operation to capture Caracas and prevent the elections of 1 December was also discovered. On 29 November the Cuban origin of the arms was confirmed. Venezuela took the matter to the OAS Council for action under Article 6 of the Rio Treaty. The crisis ended on 1 December with the successful conclusion of Venezuela's presidential election.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (The OAS agreed to investigate Venezuela's charges on 3 December, after the termination of Venezuela's crisis: in February 1964 it supported Venezuela's charges against Cuba but did not call for sanctions against Cuba which, by that time, was no longer a member of the regional organization of the Americas.)
Kenya experienced a crisis with Somalia from 20 November 1963 until 4 March 1964. In March 1963 the U.K. announced that it would grant internal self-government to the British colony of Kenya after the local parliamentary elections of 18-26 May 1963. Despite a demand from the Somali population residing in the Northern Frontier District (NFD) to secede from Kenya and unite with Somalia, it was also announced that the NFD would become the seventh region of Kenya. On 18 March Somalia severed diplomatic relations with the U.K. On 1 June Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya's first Prime Minister. The elections were boycotted by the Somali tribespeople of the NFD. In addition, Somali secessionists carried out a series of protest raids on military and police posts in the territory--according to a statement by Kenyatta, 33 attacks until 13 November. The Kenya government banned nonessential travel to the area and issued a statement to the effect that Kenya would not give up an inch of the area. The Vice-President of Kenya's eastern region, Ahmed Farah, stated on 20 November that Somalia was preparing to attack Kenya and had already secretly distributed arms to Kenya's Somalis. Kenya, he warned, should be ready for war with Somalia after independence on 12 December 1963. This marked the crisis trigger for Kenya. Fearing a full-scale insurrection in the north, Kenyatta issued an order on 28 November that he wanted all Somali raiders captured, dead or alive.  Kenya's major response, on 25 December, was a proclamation of a state of emergency along the 440-mile NFD. A five-mile prohibitive zone was established along the entire frontier. The next day Kenyan troops were placed on full alert; and on the 29th the border with Somalia was completely sealed. British troops stationed in Kenya were also sent to back up Kenya's security forces. On 28 December a military delegation from Ethiopia arrived to confer with Kenyan officials on the Somali border crisis, and a mutual defense treaty was ratified.  In February 1964 Kenya requested that the dispute be placed on the agenda of the OAU Council of Ministers. On 12 February an OAU resolution was passed detailing steps to settle the dispute and requesting the sides to refrain from propaganda. On 25 February 1964 the Kenyan state of emergency in the NFD was extended for another two months; but by the time of the 4 March elections the crisis had ended. Secessionist Somalis in the NFD participated in the election for the regional assembly, thus indicating their--and Somalia's--willingness to drop their secessionist demands.  The superpowers maintained a neutral position, but Somalia was receiving military aid from the Soviet Union and therefore regarded it as an ally. The UN was not involved.  (By mid-1967 a Zambian initiative to mediate the continued low-level conflict succeeded when Kenyan and Somali leaders promised to cease provocative acts and restore normal relations.)
From 30 November 1963 until 10 August 1964 the historic rivals, Turkey and Greece, along with Cyprus, were direct participants in the first of several international crises over the new Mediterranean island-state. The Zurich and London Conferences of 1959 worked out arrangements for Cypriot independence, subject to the terms of a series of interrelated agreements known as the Zurich-London Accords. According to these Accords, the interests of both the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus were recognized and safeguarded under a republican form of government, with several provisions insuring the fair participation of both autonomous communities in legislative functions. Once Cyprus became independent, however, each community became suspicious of the other's intentions. The Turkish minority, feeling that it did not receive all of the rights granted by the constitution, made frequent use of its legislative veto power. President Makarios, who felt that effective operation of his government was being hampered, acted often without legislative approval. Turkey's crisis and the international crisis as a whole were triggered by a memorandum from the President of the Cypriot Republic, Archbishop Makarios, to Vice-President Kutchuk on 30 November 1963 containing 13 proposals for the amendment of the 1960 constitution which would change Cyprus into a unitary state with guarantees for the Turkish minority. The trigger for Cyprus and Greece was an announcement on 6 December by Turkish Foreign Minister Erkin, rejecting the amendment proposals as totally unacceptable. The Turkish government also threatened to intervene in Cyprus if the constitution was altered in any way, accentuating a perception of high threat for Cyprus and Greece. Within this tense atmosphere, an incident on 21 December, when a Greek police patrol insisted on searching a Turkish car, sparked the outbreak of fighting between the Greek and Turkish communities in Nicosia, which spread quickly to other areas in Cyprus. Three days later the Greek Cypriot forces were on the verge of completely overrunning the Turkish section of the capital. On 24 December the Turkish Cypriots appealed to Turkey for assistance. Turkey replied that, if the fighting continued, it would intervene under the terms of the Treaty of Guarantee.  Turkey's major response, on 25 December, took the form of a series of non-violent military acts. Orders were given to the Turkish army contingent in Cyprus to move out of its camps and take positions controlling the road to Kyrenia. The Turkish fleet left the Istanbul area for the eastern Mediterranean. Its armed forces were put on alert. More troops were moved into areas that were in easy striking distance of Cyprus. And Turkish aircraft flew over Nicosia.  The Greek response, the same day, was an announcement that, if Turkey intervened in Cyprus, Greece would do likewise. Makarios, hoping to gain Security Council condemnation of the Zurich-London Accords, accused Turkey of interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus, at a session of the Security Council on 27 December. No resolution was passed at that time.  On 28 December Britain's Commonwealth Secretary, Duncan Sandys, met with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders, as well as with the ambassadors of Greece and Turkey in Cyprus. A cease-fire and the setting up of neutral zones on 29 December reduced the stress level for Turkey. The United States participated in the cease-fire talks. NATO, which was repeatedly warned by the USSR to keep out of the internal affairs of Cyprus, met in an emergency session in Paris.  A conference in London on the Cyprus issue began on 15 January 1964. A British proposal for an international peace force composed of units from NATO members was ultimately accepted by Makarios if the forces were formally dispatched by--and responsible to--the UN. Soviet Premier Khrushchev protested NATO involvement in a letter on 7 February to the U.K., the U.S., France, Greece, and Turkey. In the middle of February a Turkish threat of intervention posed the danger of renewed fighting.  The UN Security Council convened on 14 February and adopted a resolution on 4 March to establish a UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. On 13 March Turkey threatened to intervene militarily unless attacks against the Turkish community ceased immediately. The Peacekeeping Force was formed on 27 March, easing but not ending the concerns of Turkey and Greece.  Turkey's crisis escalated on 27 May 1964 when conscription orders to the Cypriot National Guard were announced for all men between the ages of 18 and 59. Despite British, Greek, and Turkish protests that the conscription bill was in violation of Cyprus's constitution, it was passed on 1 June. Greece and Turkey intensified their supply of arms to their communities on the disputed island. It was also learned that the Cyprus government was purchasing heavy arms from abroad. On 4 June, in response to the conscription bill, Turkey reaffirmed its protector role for Turkish Cypriots. However, in the face of a blunt U.S. warning the same day not to invade Cyprus, along with a threat to suspend U.S. military aid and to remain neutral if the Soviets intervened, Turkey's President Inönü announced on 5 June that it had abandoned plans to land forces in Cyprus. (Ten years later it was to do so [see Case #257--Cyprus III].)  During June tension rose again with the return of Greek General Grivas to Cyprus. The Greek and Turkish prime ministers were invited to Washington for talks in late June. Proposals by U.S. special mediator Dean Acheson were rejected by Greece. During July the UN mediator held talks in Geneva with the Greek and Turkish ambassadors.  On 4 August Greek Cypriot patrol boats fired on vessels in the Turkish Cypriot harbor of Kokkina further escalating Turkey's crisis. During the next two days several Turkish Cypriot villages fell to Greek Cypriot forces, largely because of the restrictions placed upon the UN forces by Makarios. Turkey appealed to the Security Council on the 7th and warned Makarios of possible retaliation. The following day Greek Cypriot troops attacking Kokkina were bombed by the Turkish air force. On the 9th Greece issued a threat to Ankara that, if attacks did not cease within 36 hours, Greek Cypriots would be assisted with all military means at Greece's disposal. Greek planes flew over Cyprus that day. On 9 August, too, the Security Council adopted a cease-fire resolution. The NATO Council met as well. Makarios appealed to the USSR and received a promise of Soviet support if the island were invaded. Turkey was warned to stop its military operations. President Johnson sent urgent appeals to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey to settle the crisis peacefully. An unconditional cease-fire was accepted by Cyprus and Turkey on 10 August 1964, ending the crisis for them and for Greece. Continuing tension escalated into crises with the same actors in 1967 and 1974 (see Cases #223 and #257).  This crisis found the UN, the U.S., the U.K. and NATO acting as mediators in the crisis to various degrees and effects. The UN was the most active mediator during the crisis, but it is likely that the U.S. -- through Johnson’s pleas to all actors and warning to Turkey that it would no longer automatically be under U.S. protection if it should invade Cyprus -- was the most effective mediator.
The crisis for the five actors, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and Israel, started on 11 December 1963 and ended on 5 May 1964. The dispute between Israel and the neighboring Arab states concerning the utilization of the Jordan waters was long-standing (see Case #134--Hula Drainage, in 1951). Since the mid-1940s several plans had been drawn up for its resolution, but only one, the "Revised" Unified Johnston Plan of 1955, was approved and agreed upon at the technical level by both Israel and the Arab states. However, at a meeting of the Arab League Political Committee, it was rejected in principle because of its supposed bias toward Israel. After Israel's Sinai Campaign in 1956 (see Case #152) all further hopes of Arab/Israeli acceptance of any regional water proposal were destroyed, and both sides felt free to proceed in developing their own unilateral water projects. In 1958 Jordan started working on a water scheme, and in 1959 Israel began the National Water Carrier plan for carrying water to the Negev by pumping it from Lake Tiberias. During the early months of 1960 concern by the Arab states, particularly Syria, deepened, with the Arabs claiming that Israel's water scheme would endanger Arab security because Israel could now settle larger numbers of immigrants, thereby increasing its potential military power. Under Syrian pressure a conference of Arab military chiefs of staff was held in Cairo from 7 to 10 December 1963 in order to draw up a common Arab strategy against the Israeli diversion plan, due to be completed at the end of 1963. The conference also agreed to prepare an agenda for the forthcoming December meeting of the Supreme Arab Defense Council. A crisis for all four Arab states (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt) was triggered on 11 December, the day after the Arab chiefs of staff conference, when Israel's minister of labor stated that the National Water Carrier would be operated despite pressure from the Arab states or any other country. Nasir responded on 23 December 1963 by proposing a meeting of all Arab heads of state to consider Israel's plan to divert the Jordan waters. Realizing the Arab armies were not capable of defeating Israel, Nasir hoped to check the trend toward war that was being proposed by Syria. A Summit Conference was held on 13-16 January 1964 in Cairo under the auspices of the Arab League and attended by all 13 members of the League. At the conference it was decided unanimously not to go to war with Israel but to divert the three tributaries of the Jordan River and to set up a joint (unified) military command to protect the Arab states. An official communiqué at the end of the conference, on 16 January, represented the major response to the crisis by Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. The announcement of the Arab Summit Conference decisions on 16 January triggered a crisis for Israel, which perceived a grave threat to its vital water supplies. On 19 January Israel responded by an official cabinet statement repeating its determination to carry out the plans for using the waters of the Jordan River. Both superpowers, as well as the United Nations, issued strong warnings to Israel and the Arabs against using armed force. The crisis ended on 5 May 1964 when it was officially announced by Israel that the project was completed and that it would go into operation in the summer of 1964. The announcement set off an outburst of indignation in the Arab press at the failure of the Arab governments to stop the project, but no further action was taken by them.
On 21 December 1963 a crisis began for Niger and Dahomey, lasting until 4 January 1964. Civil disorder preceded a military revolt in Dahomey that replaced President Hubert Maga with the Commander of the Army, Colonel Soglo. A provisional government was set up on 29 October 1963. There was also a sharp increase in labor strikes and regime repression prior to the onset of the crisis. Since 1960 the government of Niger was in the hands of the authoritarian President Hamani Diori, a friend and ally of Dahomey's former president. The conflict originated with a dispute over ownership of the tiny island of Lete on the Niger River, which forms the frontier between the two countries. On 21 December 1963 the National Assembly of Niger alleged that Dahomey was preparing to send troops to occupy Lete Island. Niger's response to this perceived threat, and the trigger for Dahomey, was an announcement on 22 December of the imminent expulsion of 16,000 Dahomeyans residing and working in Niger. President Soglo, on 27 December, responded with an order to close Dahomey's rail and road links to Niger, thus cutting off the Dahomeyan port of Cotonou from landlocked Niger. Both sides sent forces to the border but were deterred from military hostilities by French warnings. On 4 January delegations from both countries met at the frontier and issued a joint communiqué reopening the road and withdrawing forces. Mediation efforts -- involving delegations from Gabon, Togo, and Nigeria, and a proposal by the President of the Union Africaine et Malagache, President Yameogo of Upper Volta -- contributed to crisis abatement.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
A crisis between Rwanda and Burundi began on 21 December 1963 and ended sometime in April 1964. Relations between Rwanda and Burundi had been strained since precolonial times. Both were traditional sacred kingdoms ruled by a Mwami (king). Each kingdom was populated by three ethnic groups: the Tutsi, the Hutu, and the Twa. The Tutsi traditionally dominated politics, the military, and social life in both kingdoms.  The Belgian-administered UN Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi achieved independence as two separate states on 1 July 1962: the southern part became the Kingdom of Burundi, and the northern part became the Republic of Rwanda. Attempts by the UN to bring about the creation of a single independent state had failed.  Between 1960 and 1964 some 200,000 members of the Tutsi tribe left Rwanda and settled in the border regions of neighboring states, the Congo, Uganda, Burundi, and Tanganyika. Many of the Tutsi, however, had not given up the hope of returning to Rwanda to reestablish the monarchy (officially abolished on 2 October 1961) and thus reestablish their traditional position as political and military rulers over the majority Hutu.  Early in December 1963 the Burundi government dispersed a group of about 5,000 Tutsi refugees who had gathered on the border with Rwanda apparently intending to unleash an armed attack against their former homeland. On 21 December 1963 a crisis was triggered for Rwanda when a band of about 5,000 Tutsi exiles, armed with bows and arrows and a few rifles, invaded Rwanda from Burundi territory. The Rwanda government responded the same day by meeting the invasion with force, broadcasting a warning to the Hutu population to be "on the alert" for Tutsi invaders, and by dividing the country into nine emergency regions. By 27 December the attack had reportedly been repulsed, but the level of tension had not decreased. Bitter attacks were directed against the remaining Tutsi population in Rwanda, which appeared to have been condoned and even supported by the government. These massacres created an international problem that immediately involved the UN.  A crisis for Burundi was triggered on 22 January 1964 when it was reported that troops of the Rwanda army had violated Burundi territory and "massacred" a number of Burundi inhabitants in the border area. The Burundi response was an appeal, on 28 January 1964, to the UN and the OAU to intervene and "to put an end to provocations by Rwanda." King Mwambutsa of Burundi also wrote to UN Secretary-General U Thant to complain of the frontier violations by Rwanda. The crisis ended some time in April, without a formal agreement: by then the threat of military hostilities had been reduced sufficiently for President Kayibanda of Rwanda to allow some of the Tutsi émigrés back into the country.  UN activity was limited to dealing with the refugee problem: a Special Representative was appointed for this purpose by the Secretary-General. The OAU was minimally involved through its good offices. Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved.  (The overthrow of the king in Burundi in November 1966 facilitated a final agreement in March 1967 whereby all Tutsi refugees could return to their homes after giving up their arms.)
Panama and the U.S. experienced a brief crisis over the Panama Canal Zone from 9 to 12 January 1964. An "unequal" treaty, providing for U.S. control over the Panama Canal Zone and the Canal, was imposed on Panama in 1903. Persistent Panamanian opposition to the treaty for 60 years centered around the issues of full U.S. sovereignty over the Canal Zone, Panama's inability to fly its flag in the area, and inadequate payment, according to Panama, for unrestricted United States use of the Canal. As President Carter later acknowledged: "From the outset, Panamanians deeply resented this denial of their authority over part of their territory."  The flag issue was partly rectified in 1962 by an agreement that both flags would fly side by side at designated public sites. However, to reduce tension, the flying of both states' flags in front of Canal Zone schools was banned in December 1963. On 9 January 1964 a group of U.S. students in the Canal Zone raised the U.S. flag at Balboa High School. Massive rioting followed and was met by force: U.S. troops fired upon the Panamanian demonstrators, killing 26 and wounding 100, triggering a crisis for Panama.  The dramatic eruption of the crisis led Panama's President Chiari to break diplomatic relations with the United States the same day. He also filed a complaint with the OAS and the UN Security Council. Notification of these acts on 10 January triggered a U.S. crisis. The same day President Johnson responded by phoning Chiari to express his regret for the casualties and to call for joint efforts to restore calm. Chiari demanded a complete revision of all treaties affecting U.S./Panama relations. Johnson insisted that order must first be restored to the Canal Zone. He requested the OAS Peace Committee to investigate the matter. It took 48 hours to persuade the Panamanian president to agree to Johnson's proposal. When he did so, on 12 January, the crisis ended for both countries.  The UN was marginally involved in this crisis; the USSR was uninvolved.  (Diplomatic relations were restored on 3 April 1964. And soon after, the parties agreed to renegotiate the Panama Canal treaties, a process completed in 1979.)
A crisis for the U.K. occurred in several East African states from 19 to 30 January 1964. On 12 January 1964 a coup d'état took place in Zanzibar, a former British colony. Western observers claimed that there had been communist involvement. At that time Tanganyika, at Zanzibar's request, sent a group of armed police. The U.K. sent naval reinforcements to the coast off Dar es Salaam. On 19 January 1964 a crisis was triggered for the U.K. when soldiers of the First Battalion Tanganyika Rifles mutinied against their British and Tanganyikan officers. The European officers were captured and replaced by Africans. The rebel troops demanded an interview with President Nyerere, better pay, and the removal of the European officers. The Tanganyikan minister of the interior appealed to the U.K. to intervene in order to help control the rioting and looting. In the meantime British troops were moved from Aden to Kenya to protect British nationals in Tanganyika in case of a threat. On 21 January, in a broadcast by President Nyerere, the nation was informed that Tanganyika's internal crisis was over.  On 23 January soldiers of the Uganda Rifles mutinied and held their British officers prisoner. The U.K. received a request for aid from Prime Minister Obote and responded the same day by landing troops in Entebbe. Another request for British troops came from Tanganyika on 24 January when fighting broke out again. Troops were also rushed from Kenya to Tanganyika. Also on the 24th a brief revolt broke out in Kenya, and British troops stationed there, along with those offshore, were rushed to the scene.  On 27 January Nyerere of Tanganyika called for an emergency OAU meeting, but it did not meet. The British troops stayed in the area until 30 January when calm once more prevailed in the three former British colonies, Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda.  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
The first of several crises between Ethiopia and Somalia over Ogaden in the Horn of Africa lasted from 7 February until 30 March 1964. These two traditional enemies had contested ownership of the Ogaden Desert long before Somalia became independent in 1960. The root cause was Somalia's deep-rooted disaffection and irredentism regarding the territorial map of East Africa, with large ethnic Somali populations under foreign control--in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Tanzania.  Since Somalia's independence in 1960 the creation of a "Greater Somalia," to include the then-French colony of Djibouti, the Northern Frontier District of Kenya, and, above all, the Ogaden Desert on its western border with Ethiopia, had been a firm and clearly stated aim of the Somalia government. The water and grazing resources of Ogaden were essential to the nomadic peoples of both countries. Ogaden, the core territorial issue, was a focus of interstate dispute since 1960: Ethiopia controlled it; and Somalia claimed it.  The protracted conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia was enmeshed in the East-West Cold War during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. From 1960 until 1974 Somalia was a military client of the Soviet Union, Ethiopia of the United States. Economic conditions were severe in Somalia preceding the crisis. In November 1963 the Soviet Union concluded a military aid agreement with Somalia. Border clashes occurred in January 1964. A crisis for Ethiopia was triggered on 7 February 1964 when military forces of the Republic of Somalia carried out a large-scale attack on the Ethiopian frontier post at Tog Wajale. Ethiopia responded during the next three days with the following: military resistance at the frontier post; a declaration of a state of emergency in the border region; a call for an immediate meeting of the OAU; and a strong protest by Ethiopia's foreign minister to the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Addis Ababa. In addition, Emperor Haile Selassie addressed a message to all African heads of state informing them of the incident. Military clashes reportedly continued until 10 February. The Ethiopian retaliation on the 8th on Somali territory triggered a crisis for Somalia. Its response, on the 9th, was also multiple: resistance to the Ethiopian attack; a declaration of a state of emergency throughout Somalia; an accusation of Ethiopian penetration into Somali territory, presented to Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, and notification of the conflict to the OAU.  Somalia perceived the OAU members, many of whom experienced border disputes with their neighbors, as insensitive to its territorial claims. Success for Somalia, they feared, would constitute a precedent that would threaten the territorial integrity of other newly independent African states. Somalia looked upon the UN as a more friendly forum for its case. Thus on 10 February it requested a meeting of the Security Council, if the OAU failed to end the border dispute. Secretary-General U Thant appealed to the parties to settle the dispute peacefully. A cease-fire was accepted by them on 16 February but did not hold.  The crisis ended on 30 March 1964 with a cease-fire agreement along the original boundary, concluded in Khartoum. A joint border commission was established.  The U.S. was the major source of weapons for Ethiopia, as the USSR was for Somalia.  (Sporadic fighting continued for 10 days after the agreement. The territory in dispute--the Ogaden Desert--was retained by Ethiopia after the crisis ended. The persistent tension escalated to a full-scale crisis on several occasions later, in 1978 and 1980.)
Yemen, Egypt, and Sa'udi Arabia experienced intra-war crises from mid-May until 8 November 1964. Fighting among the adversaries broke out immediately after the cease-fire of April 1963 and continued throughout the year. President Sallal visited the Soviet Union in March and the PRC in June 1964. President Nasir visited Yemen in April 1964. (Jordan, which had at first supported the Yemen Royalists, gradually withdrew as its ties with Egypt became closer. It was not a crisis actor in any of the ensuing crises pertaining to the war in Yemen.) Reports by UN Secretary-General U Thant indicated a reduction in Egyptian forces in the area and an increase in supplies to the Royalists for the period preceding this crisis. The military situation had been fairly quiet, and the report indicated a stalemate. Republican and Egyptian forces controlled the mountains, the coastal plain, and the south of Yemen, while Royalists carried on guerrilla warfare in the mountain and desert areas of the north and east. In mid-May 1964 a retaliation attack was launched by the Royalists, triggering a crisis for the YAR and Egypt. Their response, in August, was the successful Horadeh offensive to seal the border with Sa'udi Arabia and thus prevent supplies from reaching Yemen. This triggered a crisis for Sa'udi Arabia. By 11 September the UN Yemen Observer Mission (UNYOM) had terminated its activities and left Yemen. The Sa'udi Arabian response to the crisis was Prince Faisal's visit to Alexandria on 11 September 1964 for talks with Nasir. Presidents Ben Bella of Algeria and Aref of Iraq served as mediators. The mediation led to an agreement between Sa’udi Arabia and Egypt to abide by an agreement to be administered between the royalists and the republicans in November. In this regard, peace talks were held in early November, and a cease-fire came into effect on 8 November 1964, the termination date for all three actor-cases.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
The first international crisis of the Vietnam War (1964-75) began on 30 July 1964. It ended for the United States on 7 August. North Vietnam's crisis faded in mid-August. Until the Gulf of Tonkin crisis in 1964 the U.S. presence in Southeast Asia was limited to military and economic aid to Thailand, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. United States policy in Vietnam was based upon the maintenance of a separate state in South Vietnam. Any support to the insurgency in the south by North Vietnam was viewed as external aggression. The U.S. supported the repressive Ngo Dinh Diem regime in Saigon against rebellion, but the growth of insurgency in the south was rapid. Southerners, regrouped in North Vietnam, began to return to join the expanding military strength of the Vietcong. During 1962 the United States undertook a major military buildup in Vietnam: U.S. helicopter crews took an active part in the war. A Buddhist uprising against the Diem government, accompanied by acts of suicide by Buddhist monks, dramatized the situation and brought about U.S. political pressure against Diem. On 1 November 1963 Diem was murdered, and a Military Revolutionary Council took power under General Duong van Minh. At that time less than half the territory of South Vietnam was under effective Saigon control. President Kennedy's assassination followed shortly thereafter. In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson reassured the public that Americans would not be sent to fight in Vietnam. Nevertheless, he would never permit communist expansion there. Across the Pacific, on 25 July 1964, Hanoi Radio charged that Americans had fired on a North Vietnamese fishing craft. On 30 July 1964 South Vietnamese patrol boats, on a U.S.-backed covert 34A mission, attacked two North Vietnamese islands in the Gulf of Tonkin. This triggered a crisis for North Vietnam. It responded by a tit-for-tat attack on 2 August--the U.S. destroyer Maddox was attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin off North Vietnam, with a second attack on 4 August against two U.S. destroyers. Neither resulted in casualties or damage.  The U.S. response was prompt. Shortly after the second attack President Johnson ordered an air attack against North Vietnamese gunboats and their supporting facilities. And on the 5th he asked the U.S. Congress to pass a resolution to authorize all necessary action to protect U.S. armed forces and to assist nations covered by the SEATO treaty. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving the president broad war powers in defense of U.S. and allied interests in Southeast Asia, was passed on 7 August. This ended the U.S.'s crisis. The bombing of North Vietnam ceased in mid-August; and North Vietnam's crisis faded shortly thereafter.  The United States requested a UN Security Council meeting and called for a session of SEATO, as well as informing its NATO allies of events through high-level consultations. Nothing concrete emerged from these meetings. No clear agreement between Hanoi and Washington was reached. The outcome of the crisis led to an escalation of tension in the area. The USSR provided political support to Hanoi.
The formation of a rebel regime and the taking of hostages in Stanleyville led to a crisis for Congo (later, Zaire), Belgium, the United States, and the USSR lasting from 4 August to 30 December 1964. On 29 September 1963 President Kasavubu disbanded Congo's parliament after a series of increasingly repressive measures was passed against the political opposition. The deterioration of economic and social conditions, along with repression, led to societal unrest that manifested itself in tribal fighting, raids, and other arbitrary acts of violence--mainly in East Katanga and Upper Congo. Large-scale uprisings, led by the National Liberation Committee (NLC), occurred during January and April 1964. On 30 June the UN Emergency Force, which had been set up in 1960, left Congo. In July of that year Kasavubu requested Moise Tshombe to form a new government. The governments of Congo-Brazzaville, Burundi, and Mali were accused of giving support to the NLC, as were the USSR and China, which were providing arms and military training. Rebel activities against the central government increased, and large areas in the eastern part of the country, including Stanleyville, were under control of the rebel forces. The trigger to Congo's crisis was the formation of a Revolutionary Council in Stanleyville on 4 August 1964, with the NLC leader Christophe Gbenye as President, after rebel forces had occupied the city. Congo's response, on the 6th, was an appeal by Premier Tshombe to the United States and Belgium for direct military aid. Tshombe also took his case to the OAU, which resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to examine the situation and to act as a mediator between the central Congo government and the rebels.  The trigger for the United States and Belgium occurred on 26 September when Gbenye, who was holding 1,500 white foreign civilians as hostages in Stanleyville, announced that they would not be allowed to leave the city. Their safety was made contingent upon a cease-fire, the eschewing of bombings by the central government, and the termination of Western support. This was accompanied by threats of physical harm against the hostages if those conditions were rejected. The U.S.'s, and Belgium's, major response, on 22 November, was to dispatch paratroops to a British base in Congo to prepare for a military rescue of the hostages. On the 24th an emergency NATO meeting, requested by Belgium, expressed sympathy and support for the Western countries.  The paratroops occupied Stanleyville on 24 November and rescued the hostages within a few hours. The Congo government coordinated an attack on the rebels for the same time as the rescue mission. Control was handed back to the central government on 29 November, marking the termination date for Belgium and the United States.  A crisis for the USSR was triggered by the Belgian/U.S. rescue mission on 24 November. The Soviets feared that Tshombe's pro-Western regime would crush the rebels and thus reduce Soviet influence in the area. The USSR's response, on the 26th, was to accuse the U.S., Belgium, and Britain of aggressive intervention. The Soviet crisis ended on 17 December when its embassy in Kinshasa was closed down.  Discussions were held at the Security Council between 9 and 30 December. It adopted a resolution on 30 December, calling for a cease-fire in the fighting between the rebels and the central government, the removal of mercenaries, and a stop to foreign intervention. This terminated Congo's crisis and the international crisis as a whole.  (In early 1965 President Kasavubu dismissed Premier Tshombe and was himself ousted in a coup d'état led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu on 25 November 1965. Relations between Congo-Brazzaville and Congo-Kinshasa remained poor until 1970, when diplomatic relations and river traffic were finally restored.)
This phase of the long war in Yemen, considered as crises for Egypt, Yemen, and Sa'udi Arabia, lasted from 3 December 1964 to 25 August 1965. The peace talks, which were held in Sudan, led to a cease-fire on 8 November 1964, as well as an agreement to set up a National Congress to deal with the fundamental differences between the Republicans and the Royalists. By 20 November an announcement was made postponing the Congress; and on 13 December it was postponed indefinitely. The Royalist Foreign Minister, Ahmed al-Shami, made it clear that, if Royalist demands were not accepted, they would renew the fighting. The political confusion in Yemen was further intensified in December by an open split among the Republicans. On 3 December 1964 a Royalist offensive, backed by Sa'udi Arabia, was launched. Eventually they occupied most of the territory captured by the Republicans. This triggered a crisis for Egypt and Yemen. Their major response, on 10 January 1965, was the resumption of fighting. There were heavy casualties on both sides. The information minister of the Royalist government alleged on 23 January that Egyptian aircraft had dropped gas bombs, the crisis trigger for Sa'udi Arabia.  A Royalist request to the International Red Cross to investigate the charges was refused on the grounds that the use of gas was not forbidden by any International Red Cross convention. Fighting continued in the southeastern region, as well as in northern Yemen. Egyptian attempts in March and May to cut the Royalists' supply routes from Sa'udi Arabia failed. A strong Royalist offensive near Haral (Sa'udi frontier) on 7 June was repulsed. Yemen's Republican government lodged a complaint with the UN on 26 July, accusing Sa'udi Arabia of aiding the Royalists and claiming that, without Sa'udi support, the Royalists would have been defeated long before. Reports of large-scale Sa'udi and Iranian support were frequent from February 1965 onward.  Negotiations for a peace settlement, mediated in part by King Hussein of Jordan, the Crown Prince of Kuwait, and President Ben Bella of Algeria, began in May 1965. Although both crisis actors viewed the mediation as irrelevant, there is evidence that the mediation did have an important effect on crisis abatement. After prolonged consultation in Cairo among the YAR leaders, President Sallal announced on 18 July a compromise agreement between the dissident Republicans and reaffirmed the proposals of the Khamner Conference. On 22 July President Nasir said that Egypt had reopened negotiations with Sa'udi Arabia concerning Egyptian troop withdrawal.  An agreement signed by President Nasir and King Faisal in Jiddah on 24 August provided for the following: an immediate cease-fire; the ending of Sa'udi aid to the Royalists; the withdrawal of Egyptian forces; the establishment of a provisional Yemen government; and the holding of a plebiscite in November 1966. The next day the Royalists stopped fighting; and the Egyptian forces began to withdraw from Yemen. This marked the end of the crisis--but not yet of the war or the protracted conflict.  The USSR continued to provide military aid to Egypt and the YAR. The UN and the U.S. were marginally involved in this crisis.
This intrawar crisis for the United States, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam lasted from 7 February to late March 1965. In the six months after the Gulf of Tonkin crisis, fighting took place between South and North Vietnam with minimum U.S. participation. In the United States a debate ensued regarding U.S. commitments to the government in Saigon which, on 27 January 1965, had been taken over by a military coup. A crisis for the United States and South Vietnam was triggered on 7 February 1965 when Vietcong guerrillas staged a night raid against U.S. and South Vietnam army barracks at Pleiku, killing eight and wounding 126. The U.S. response was a decision by President Johnson on the 13th, following a meeting of his National Security Council, in favor of measured and limited air action jointly with South Vietnam against selected military targets in North Vietnam. When news of "Operation Rolling Thunder" became public, on 19 February, it triggered an intrawar crisis (IWC) for North Vietnam.  The Pleiku crisis for the U.S. and South Vietnam ended on 2 March, the day the first of the U.S. air strikes began. This action marked a sharp escalation in the evolution of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. For North Vietnam the crisis faded later in March. There was no clear outcome: the U.S. was pulled deeper into the morass of Vietnam; the North Vietnamese suffered from--but learned to adapt to--increased U.S. bombing.  There was minimal UN activity: Secretary-General U Thant called for all sides to negotiate, but his efforts were unsuccessful. The USSR extended military aid to North Vietnam.
A crisis over territory between India and Pakistan, one of many since 1947, lasted from 8 April until 30 June 1965. The princely state of Kutch acceded to the Indian Union in 1947; but Pakistan claimed the northern part of the Rann of Kutch as its territory. Incidents occurred in 1956, but Indian control over the disputed territory was quickly restored. In January 1965 Pakistani forces began patrolling in areas claimed by India. Crises were triggered for India and Pakistan on 8 April 1965 when each attacked the other's police post in the disputed territory (the question, who attacked first, remains shrouded in competing reports by the two crisis actors). On the 14th both parties agreed to stop fighting; but intense military hostilities resumed during the last week of April.  The U.K. called for a cease-fire based upon the restoration of positions held by each side as of 1 January 1965. This was followed by intense trilateral negotiations, involving New Delhi, Islamabad, and London, ending in a cease-fire agreement on 11 May. However, the crisis for India and Pakistan did not end until 30 June, when both parties agreed to all the terms of the cease-fire: mutual withdrawal of forces, direct negotiations, and arbitration if all else failed to settle the dispute. Harold Wilson, the Prime Minster of Great Britain, acted as the primary mediator in the crisis and was instrumental in brokering the cease-fire agreement.  Moscow expressed the hope that India and Pakistan would exercise restraint and settle the dispute in a manner safeguarding the interests of both states. A U.S. statement deplored the fighting and offered American help in restoring peace to the subcontinent. India charged that Pakistani forces were using American equipment, leading to deteriorating U.S.-Indian relations. Beijing supported Pakistan throughout the crisis.  (A few months later, India and Pakistan were at war once more [see Case #216].)  (On 19 February 1968 the ad hoc Indo-Pakistani Western Boundary Tribunal, established by the U.K.-mediated agreement of 30 June 1965, awarded India 90 percent of the Rann of Kutch and 10 percent [300 square miles] to Pakistan.)
A crisis for the United States in Central America began on 24 April and ended on 31 August 1965. In December 1962, more than a year after the assassination of its long-time dictator, Rafael L. Trujillo, the first free elections in 38 years were held in the Dominican Republic. Juan Bosch was inaugurated as President in February 1963. In September military officers, alleging communist control of the civilian regime, staged a coup. Donald Reid y Cabral acted as puppet President while real power lay in the hands of a three-man military junta. A crisis for the United States was triggered on 24 April 1965 when Bosch supporters overthrew the junta. Civil war broke out immediately. U.S. embassy personnel cabled President Johnson that American lives were in danger. The United States responded on 28 April with a decision to send 400 army paratroops and marines to the island. By 2 May the U.S. force was 14,000 and by 20 May 22,000. All foreign citizens were evacuated. The next day Johnson assigned U.S. military units the task of restoring order. On 30 April the U.S. called for an OAS meeting.  While fighting continued, intense diplomatic activity was taking place within the OAS and the UN, as well as bilateral U.S./Dominican negotiations. An OAS resolution called for a cease-fire, mediation, and the dispatch of an Inter-American Peace Force to the Dominican Republic. In the Security Council, Cuba and the USSR charged the United States with military intervention in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic. A mild Security Council resolution on 14 May called for a cease-fire and authorized the Secretary-General to take appropriate action. U Thant appointed Dr. José Antonio Mayobri as his Personal Representative.  OAS Secretary General Jose Mora began mediating between the U.S.-backed military junta and Bosch’s constitutionalist party on 30 April 1965. Since the U.S. had significant influence within the OAS, the mediation was potentially biased. Nonetheless, the mediation led to a compromise in late June that was agreeable to the junta, the constitutionalists and the U.S. "The Act of Dominican Reconciliation," signed on 31 August 1965, ended four months of civil war and, with it, the international crisis. All sides compromised by agreeing on Garcia-Godoy, a moderate, as provisional president.  (Further military incidents occurred in late 1965 and 1966. Free elections were held once more, in June 1966, in which Joaquín Balaguer defeated Juan Bosch and was elected President of the Dominican Republic.)
The second India/Pakistan crisis over Kashmir--there had been many incidents--lasted from 5 August 1965 to 10 January 1966. In accordance with the Rann of Kutch agreement (see Case #214), Pakistan's President, Ayub Khan, ordered the withdrawal of all Pakistani troops from the frontiers with India on 2 July 1965. Shortly thereafter similar instructions were issued to Indian forces. Another 1965 crisis for India was triggered on 5 August when Pakistani "freedom fighters" began infiltrating into the Vale of Kashmir to create a large-scale uprising against Indian control over most of the former princely state. On 25 August India sent several thousand troops across the 1949 Kashmir Cease-fire Line, capturing most of the areas through which the infiltrators came and triggering a crisis for Pakistan. The latter responded on 1 September by dispatching an armored column across the cease-fire line in southern Kashmir and threatening the vital road linking the capital city of Srinagar with the plains of India. India's major response was to invade West Pakistan on 5 September. On 4 and 6 September, the UN Security Council called for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces. On the 7th China denounced Indian "aggression" against Pakistan and alleged Indian provocation on the border of Sikkim and Tibet.  An intrawar crisis was triggered for India on 16 September when China issued an ultimatum: unless the Indian government dismantled all military bases near the Chinese border and stopped all intrusions into China, it would have to bear full responsibility for the grave consequences. India responded on the 17th by rejecting Chinese allegations while hinting at a willingness to make minor concessions. Although India reported Chinese troop movements to within 500 meters of Indian positions on the 18th, by 21 September China had withdrawn its ultimatum by an announcement on Beijing Radio that India had complied with the Chinese demands. This diversionary crisis for India was thus resolved on 21 September 1965.  The threat of Chinese intervention stimulated the superpowers to seek a rapid termination of the war between India and Pakistan. New efforts were made through the Security Council. A resolution, to which both parties agreed, was drawn up on 17 September, and the UN Observer Mission, in Kashmir since 1949, was strengthened. Military hostilities subsided by 25 September. However, this did not mark the termination of the crisis, for both armies still faced each other across the Punjab border, each occupied one another's territory, and a series of violations of the cease-fire agreement occurred.  On 17 September Soviet Premier Kosygin proposed a conference in Tashkent between Pakistan's President Ayub Khan and India's Prime Minister Shastri. The conference, held between 4 and 10 January 1966, began with initial difficulties because India refused to discuss the Kashmir issue and Pakistan demanded that it would not concede anything unless there was discussion of Kashmir. Both parties threatened to leave but Kosygin insisted that they stay for a final session. In this session, Kosygin persuaded Pakistan to pull back its forces by threatening to aid India unless they did so. Through the mediation effort, the conference ended with a declaration affirming the intentions of both parties to restore diplomatic, economic, and trade relations, to withdraw troops to the internationally recognized borders, and to repatriate prisoners of war. The Tashkent Declaration ended the crisis on 10 January 1966.  On 8 September 1965 U.S. Secretary of State Rusk had informed the Senate that the U.S. had suspended military aid to both India and Pakistan and that no new commitments of economic assistance to either party had been made. Since the U.S. was the sole supplier of arms to Pakistan, while India received arms from several sources, notably the USSR, the embargo was especially effective against Pakistan.  UN Secretary-General U Thant visited the area but was unable to persuade either side to take a more flexible position. However, the Security Council resolution of 17 September was agreed to by India on the 20th and by Pakistan on the 22nd.
A crisis for Guinea began on 9 October 1965 and ended in mid-December that year. Guinea's independence from France in October 1958 was followed by a severe curtailment of French aid and expertise. In the year prior to this crisis the political climate in Guinea was constantly troubled, the standard of living had dropped, and consumer goods were expensive and irregularly supplied. Many Guineans fled the country in search of more favorable economic conditions.  In July 1965 a meeting was held in Paris among the Presidents of the Ivory Coast (Houphouet-Boigny), Niger (Diori), and Upper Volta (Yameogo), with Tshombe from the Congo and two French ministers. According to Guinea's President, Sekou Touré, this group decided to provide funds and other aid to Guineans who wished to remove him from the presidency. Three attempts to overthrow the Guinean government between February and October 1965 were uncovered and halted. The crisis trigger for Guinea was internal: on 9 October 1965 the statutes of a new opposition party to the only authorized party in Guinea were deposited with the Guinean minister of the interior. On 12 October Mamadou Touré, leader of the Parti de l'Unité Nationale de Guinee, was arrested, and disorders in Guinea's second town, Kankan, were suppressed. Guinea's formal complaint to the OAU on 17 November alleged that subversive acts were being financed by the Ivory Coast, with a view to a coup d'état in Guinea. Houphouet-Boigny publicly refuted Sekou Touré's charges. On 7 December Guinea allegations against France were reiterated in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which offered its good offices.  By mid-December Sekou Touré had succeeded in overcoming the threat to his regime, and the crisis ended through a tacit understanding by the parties.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
A proclamation of a state of emergency by the white minority regime in Southern Rhodesia precipitated a crisis for Zambia from 5 November 1965 to 27 April 1966. With the dissolution of the Federation on 1 January 1964, competing pressures mounted within Rhodesia. There was growing evidence in 1964 and 1965 that the white regime in Southern Rhodesia planned to issue a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). At the same time, the African National Council and its key members pressed for black majority rule.  In that atmosphere of increasing conflict, 18 Commonwealth heads of government, meeting in July 1964, unanimously pledged not to recognize a unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia. Tension increased when many African leaders were detained in late August. On 27 October British Prime Minister Wilson publicly warned against UDI and threatened sanctions.  In May 1965 Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front won an overwhelming victory in white-only elections. In early October Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, in London, demanded immediate independence.  Zambia, which itself had become independent on 24 October 1964, viewed the possible establishment of a hostile white-ruled state, independent of the U.K., as a threat to its existence: being landlocked, Zambia was totally dependent on Rhodesia for rail routes to ports, sources of coal and oil, and power from the jointly owned hydroelectric stations at the Kariba Dam on the Rhodesia-Zambia border. The trigger to Zambia's gravest foreign policy crisis was Rhodesia's proclamation of a state of emergency on 5 November 1965, granting the white regime in Salisbury sweeping powers. Zambia correctly perceived this to be a prelude to Rhodesia's declaration of independence. The next day, Zambia issued a final warning to Rhodesia of the consequences of such an act. Rhodesian troops were moved to the Zambian border on 9 November. And on the 11th independence was declared.  Zambia's response, the next day, combined the dispatch of troops to the Zambezi River, a promulgation of emergency regulations, and limited economic sanctions against Rhodesia: Rhodesia's currency and money orders would not be negotiable in Zambia as of 13 November. And on the 17th Zambia's President Kaunda began sustained pressure on the U.K. for an immediate military response or, at least, British guarantees for Zambia's supply of Kariba power. Zambia also pressed for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. Despite U.K. objections to intervention by the global organization, the Council did pass several resolutions--on 12 October and 5, 12, and 20 November. The most important, on 12 November, condemned UDI, urged nonrecognition by member-states, and appealed to them to refrain from rendering any assistance to Rhodesia.  On 20 November, at an OAU meeting in Dar es Salaam, representatives from Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia debated the setting up of a multinational African army; but as a result of Zambia's opposition, no action was taken. After initial British refusal to exert military pressure on Rhodesia, the U.K. finally offered to send ground troops to Zambia for protection against invasion. Zambia, which viewed this suggestion as designed to prevent, rather than prepare for, military action against Rhodesia, refused. On 23 November discussions began on a proposal to station Royal Air Force (RAF) units at Zambia's three international airfields, in order to deter a Rhodesian air attack. The following day, Zambian troops were withdrawn from the border, and the U.K. Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, announced that Britain and Zambia had agreed on the provision of RAF planes and personnel for Zambia's air defense. By the time the Extraordinary Meeting of the OAU Council of Ministers convened, on 3 December, to consider the severance of diplomatic relations with the U.K. by several states, the RAF was being installed at Zambia's airfields. On the 28th Zambian ministerial missions visited Washington and Moscow with a view to securing superpower support for a more vigorous response to UDI and increased assistance to Zambia. A UN oil embargo on Rhodesia (and therefore, Zambia) led to the mounting of an Anglo-American-Canadian oil airlift to Zambia in early January 1966. The Commonwealth, too, acted in support of Zambia, at its Lagos summit meeting in January 1966: it established a committee to monitor the effect of sanctions; and it urged members to provide aid to Zambia in a Commonwealth-coordinated program.  The success of the Berlin-style (1948-49) airlift to Zambia, and the development of alternative surface supply routes, encouraged Wilson to believe that UDI could end "within weeks, not months," providing that Zambia imposed complete sanctions and broke entirely with Rhodesia. Wilson promised massive external support and a tougher British policy on Rhodesia, but these promises were adjusted during February and March 1966. And, finally, London reneged altogether on 27 April, following the British general elections, which returned a commanding majority for Labour. On that day the crisis ended for Zambia: although it felt betrayed by Wilson's announcement of the initiation of "talks about talks" with Rhodesia's Prime Minister Smith, Zambia's existence was no longer in peril.  (The completion of a pipeline from Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean, almost three years later, reduced Zambia's dependence on Rhodesia for oil, coal, and electricity.)
The last phase of the long war in Yemen took place between 14 October 1966 and 26 September 1967. There were three crisis actors: Sa'udia Arabia, Egypt, and Yemen. On 23 November 1965 Yemeni Republican and Royalist delegations, together with observers from Egypt and Sa'udi Arabia, met to discuss the nature of the plebiscite agreed upon at Jiddah. The parties failed to reach agreement on any of the items on the agenda. Intermittent fighting continued. A new agreement for a peace settlement in Yemen was reached in Kuwait on 19 August 1966 but was never put into effect. The long war was renewed. On 14 October 1966 air raids began on Royalist-controlled villages in the northern mountains, a main target being the headquarters of the Royalists. Two Sa'udi villages were also bombed, the crisis trigger for Sa'udi Arabia. On 24 October intelligence reports that a strong concentration of Royalist tribesmen was gathering for an attack on the town of Sa'dah triggered another intra-war crisis for Egypt and Yemen. The YAR response, on 30 October, was a combined attack on Sa'udi troops and the Royalist Homdon tribe. Egypt's response was the use of poison gas in bombings of Halhal, a Royalist-held town, on 27 December 1966. Other gas bombings by Egypt were reported in January. Egypt's expeditionary force had reached 50,000-60,000.  The Sa'udi response to the crisis occurred the next day--a combined Royalist-Sa'udi attack on Yemen President Sallal's residence and a military post in the YAR capital, San'a. The Sa'udi Arabian delegate to the UN complained to the Secretary-General and warned that Sa'udi patience was at an end. On 28 February 1967 U Thant, whose offer of good offices was the main UN involvement, stated that he was powerless to deal with the matter. Jordan and Tunisia withdrew their recognition of the YAR. A UN General Assembly resolution of 5 December 1966 condemned the use of poison gas as contrary to international law, as well as to the policies of governments throughout the world.  The Republicans remained seriously divided during the early months of 1967. Military action was confined to sporadic Egyptian air raids on Royalist villages, in which poison gas bombs were reported to have been dropped. In March there were reports of a serious split among the Royalists. A reconciliation was reached on 10 April when a Royalist government-in-exile was formed. The crisis in May and the outbreak of war between Israel and Egypt beginning 5 June (see Case #222--Six Day War, in Arab/Israel PC) produced a transformation of the situation in Yemen: Egypt began withdrawing large numbers of troops. Yet a counteroffensive by Egyptian and Republican forces was launched in July. A Republican delegation visited Moscow to discuss Soviet military and economic aid to the YAR.  Muhammad Ahmad Maliyih, Prime Minister of Sudan, began a successful mediation effort on 20 August, when he visited King Faisal in Sa’udi Arabia and created a new peace plan. On 24 August, Maliyih visited President Nasir in Cairo and discussed the new plan. This paved the way for an agreement between Nasir and Faisal that was concluded at Maliyih’s residence in Khartoum on 31 August 1967. Under this agreement Egypt was to withdraw its forces. Egypt began its final evacuation of Yemen on 26 September, marking the termination date of the crisis.  The U.S. was marginally involved in this crisis; and the USSR continued to provide military aid to Egypt and the YAR.  (Sa'udi Arabia subsequently withdrew as well; but the civil war between Royalist and Republican Yemen simmered for another two years. An unwritten agreement was finally concluded whereby a number of Royalist leaders would be appointed to the presidential council and the government of Yemen. The YAR was officially recognized by Sa'udi Arabia, the U.K., and France in July 1970.)
The two actors in this crisis, a prelude to the Six Day War (see Case #222), were Israel and Jordan. It began on 12 November 1966 and ended on the 15th of that month. A series of border infiltrations and terrorist attacks on Israel emanating from Jordan took place from the summer of 1966 onward. On 12 November an Israel crisis was triggered when an army command car was blown up by a mine near the Jordanian border. Three soldiers were killed and six wounded. In an effort to deter Jordan from further aid to the Palestinian infiltrators, Israel responded the following day with a commando raid on the village of El Samu, in Jordan, where Palestinian supporters were concentrated. Jordan's response to the raid was mobilization of its army. Heavy fighting took place, and Israel withdrew a few hours later. Jordan appealed to the Security Council and issued an internal state of alert, especially against possible riots on the West Bank. Jordan ended the state of alert on the 15th, terminating the crisis for both countries.  The Secretary-General of the UN met with the ambassadors of both actors, but the UN did not resolve the crisis. The U.S. was politically involved in this crisis; the USSR was not.
Guerrilla activity, led by Cuban revolutionary Ché Guevara, caused a crisis for Bolivia from 23 March to 10 October 1967. In October 1966 Ché Guevara left Cuba on a secret mission--to establish a guerrilla training camp in Bolivia to bring about the overthrow of the Bolivian government. La Paz newspapers began reporting the presence of guerrilla forces in the Santa Cruz region in early March 1967. There was no comment on these reports by Bolivian authorities. An ambush by guerrillas of a large Bolivian army patrol in the Santa Cruz region on 23 March 1967 triggered a crisis for Bolivia. The incident was reported by Bolivian President Barrientos in a broadcast to the nation on the 27th. Bolivia feared that the pro-Cuban guerrilla movement might serve as a catalyst to revolt and would spread antigovernment sentiment in the country.  On 30 March Bolivian troops were moved to the southeast region, more forces were mobilized, and clashes with the guerrillas ensued. Bolivia's major response, the next day, was a request to the United States for arms and aid. A policy of containment was decided upon, and on 1 April Barrientos flew to the area in which 3,000 Bolivian soldiers had encircled the guerrillas until an effective fighting force could be trained. On 11 April the U.S. sent 40 advisors to train antiguerrilla forces, in addition to modern weapons, including helicopters.  Bolivia decreed a state of siege on 2 June, suspending constitutional guarantees, after Bolivian students and miners staged demonstrations in support of the guerrillas. Toward the end of June the Bolivian government confirmed officially that Ché Guevara was in command of a force of well-trained Cubans in southeast Bolivia. Bolivia appealed to Argentina to send troops to assist in the counterinsurgency operation but received only supplies and arms.  The OAS Foreign Ministers Conference met in Washington on 21 September, at Venezuela's request. At the meeting Bolivian representatives made public captured guerrilla documents, diaries, and photographs. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk urged the OAS to tighten the diplomatic, economic, and political isolation of Cuba. The OAS passed a resolution condemning Cuban subversive activities in the Western Hemisphere.  On 10 October Barrientos announced that Ché Guevara had been killed by government troops on the 8th and that his death had ended the guerrilla movement in Bolivia.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (Twenty-eight years later, in October 1995, a retired Bolivian army general revealed that he had been an eyewitness to the hitherto-unconfirmed killing of the legendary revolutionary figure.)
The six actors in this Middle East crisis were Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the United States, Syria, and the Soviet Union. It began on 17 May and ended on 11 June 1967. Tension along the Israel/Syria border had been increasing since the autumn of 1966 due to the stepping up of attacks by Palestinian guerrillas based in Syria. On 7 April 1967 six Syrian MIG fighter planes were downed in an air battle over the Israel/Syria border. Israel repeatedly warned Syria that a massive reprisal would be inevitable if Damascus did not stop active support of Palestinian raids into Israel. On 14 May both Syria and Egypt announced a state of emergency based upon Soviet-inspired reports that Israel was concentrating troops on its northern border. Two hostile acts by Egypt on 17 May 1967 triggered a crisis for Israel: an overflight of Israel's nuclear research center at Dimona and the dispatch of two additional Egyptian divisions into Sinai (others had crossed the Canal in the preceding two days). On the 18th UN Secretary-General U Thant acceded to President Nasir's demand, two days earlier, to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) from Sinai. (It had functioned since the 1956 Suez War [see Case #152].) Army reserves were mobilized in Israel and Egypt on the 19th and 21st. And on 23 May Egypt announced the closure of the Strait of Tiran, thus blockading the Israeli port of Eilat. The British and U.S. governments termed this act a violation of international law, while the Soviet Union blamed Israel for the dangerous situation in the Middle East. Efforts by the U.S. and the U.K. to form a naval flotilla failed. The U.S. Sixth Fleet moved toward the eastern Mediterranean. The Security Council met at the request of Canada and Denmark. On 30 May a Defense Pact was signed between Jordan and Egypt.  Israel's major response to its crisis was a decision on 4 June to launch a preemptive strike. This was implemented by an air attack on Egypt's air force bases on 5 June, destroying Egyptian air power and triggering a crisis for Jordan and Egypt. Despite an Israeli assurance to Jordan via the United Nations that, if Jordan kept out of the war, Israel would not initiate any military action against its eastern neighbor, Jordan responded the same day by opening fire on Jerusalem and bombing Netanya. Israel destroyed the small Jordanian air force and, by noon of 7 June, captured the Jordan-controlled Old City of Jerusalem. Egypt's response, on 5 June, was to launch a counterattack against Israel.  The crisis trigger for the United States was a message from Premier Kosygin on 6 June threatening Soviet intervention. The crises for Syria and the Soviet Union were triggered on the 9th by Israeli advances on the Golan Heights. Syria responded immediately by bombarding Israeli border settlements. The next day the Soviets responded with a "hot line" telephone call from Kosygin to Johnson threatening Soviet action unless Israel halted operations at once. The major U.S. response was an immediate order by President Johnson to change the course of the Sixth Fleet and to cut the 100-mile restriction from the Syrian coast to 50 miles, signaling that the U.S. was prepared to resist Soviet intervention in the Arab/Israel war. Syria accepted a cease-fire on 10 June. The following day the cease-fire came into effect for all the other actors, terminating the 1967 Middle East Crisis.  Five East European states, together with the Soviet Union, severed diplomatic relations with Israel, namely, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. The UN helped to escalate the crisis, by the removal of UNEF, but it also contributed to the more rapid termination of the crisis through the efforts of the Security Council and cease-fire resolutions. The political activity of the two superpowers, especially that of the U.S., had an important impact on the course of the crisis and its outcome.
Another crisis over the Mediterranean island-state, among Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, broke out on 15 November and ended on 4 December 1967. The cease-fire of August 1964 was breached in 1967 in a clash between Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot forces. The crisis trigger for Turkey was an attack by the Greek-Cypriot National Guard against two Turkish-Cypriot villages on 15 November 1967. Turkey responded on the 17th with a resolution by its Grand National Assembly that authorized the government to decide upon the number and destination of armed forces to be dispatched to the area to deal with any new situation that might occur and to call for General Grivas, head of the Greek forces in Cyprus, to be sent home. This constituted the crisis trigger for Cyprus and Greece.  The Greek response was to recall Grivas for consultations on 19 November. Greece also indicated that it was ready to negotiate. On 22 November UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a message to the three states urging them to avoid war. Cyprus, on 24 November, called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council, which subsequently met and discussed the situation. Discussions between Greece and Turkey took place with Cyrus Vance, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, as mediator. Vance used shuttle diplomacy and placed heavy pressure on Greece to bring the conflicting parties to an agreement. In addition to Vance’s efforts, NATO and U.S. envoys served as secondary mediators in order to control this situation that was delicate to the West because of the powerful diplomatic presence of the Soviet Union. An agreement was reached on 1 December 1967 between Turkey and Greece. Cyprus signed on 4 December, terminating the crisis as a whole. Greece agreed to withdraw all troops from Cyprus that exceeded the number specified in the London and Zurich agreements of 1959-60. Turkey canceled large-scale preparations for an invasion of Cyprus.
A crisis for South Korea, the U.S., and North Korea began on 21 January and ended on 23 December 1968. The U.S. and North Korea were engaged in negotiations at Panmunjom since the end of the Korean War in 1953 but were unsuccessful in areas other than the exchange of prisoners (see Case #140--Korean War III). The U.S.S. Pueblo was an electronic surveillance intelligence ship that had been stationed off the coast of North Korea, purportedly on an oceanographic research mission, with orders to stay at least 14 miles off the coast of North Korea. Relations between North Korea and the USSR were strained; and the former wished to assert its influence in East Asia. The Pueblo crisis was closely linked to another intra-Korea crisis, which began on 21 January 1968 when a North Korea commando unit penetrated the Blue House in Seoul in a failed attempt to assassinate South Korea's President, Park Chung Hee. This triggered a security crisis for South Korea. In response to North Korea's commando raid, South Korea sought a security guarantee from the U.S. This was granted de facto in a joint communiqué by Presidents Johnson and Park on 17 April 1968, terminating South Korea's 21 January crisis.  A day after the commando raid, that is, 22 January, a crisis for the U.S. was triggered by seizure of the Pueblo by North Korean patrol and torpedo boats. The major response of the U.S. was to call up army and air force reservists on 25 January and to dispatch naval power to the North Korea coast: the U.S. aircraft carrier, Enterprise, and its task force were diverted from their course toward the North Vietnam coast and ordered into the Sea of Japan. This U.S. response triggered a crisis for North Korea.  At the Panmunjom Armistice Talks the U.S. demanded the return of the Pueblo and its crew. This demand was refused, with North Korea claiming that the Pueblo was spying in its territorial waters. The U.S. insisted that the Pueblo was 25 miles off the North Korean coast. The Soviets refused a request by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow to use their good offices to bring about the Pueblo's release. An appeal was also made to the Security Council by the U.S. The next day, 26 January, the Soviet Union, which supported North Korea's claim that the Pueblo was in its territorial waters, sent a trawler to shadow the Enterprise. A second request for USSR intervention to restrain North Korea, made by U.S. Ambassador Thompson, was rejected. Inter alia the incident provided the means for an improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and North Korea.  By 3 February North Korea and the U.S. reached agreement to continue to use the Panmunjom talks as a vehicle for negotiating the end of the Pueblo crisis. The U.S. then withdrew the Enterprise and its task force, and the military threat decreased. The admission of spying by the Pueblo commander was broadcast by North Korea on 16 February. It was rejected by the U.S. as fabricated.  Negotiations between North Korea and the U.S. over the Pueblo continued for 10 months until an imposed agreement was reached on 23 December 1968. The U.S. representative, Major-General Woodward, issued an apology stating that the Pueblo had been in North Korean waters and acknowledged that the confessions of its commander and, later, some crew members were genuine. Before signing it, however, Woodward read a public statement disavowing the apology. The crew was returned to South Korea, but the ship was never recovered by the U.S.  The UN was approached by the U.S. but only discussed the issue. The USSR continued to provide military aid to North Korea.
The Tet crisis for South Vietnam and the United States began on 30 January and ended on 31 March 1968. "Operation Rolling Thunder" marked a basic U.S. policy change aimed at compelling the enemy to negotiate on Washington's terms. By the end of 1966 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam had increased to 375,000. The escalation of the air war proceeded steadily. In early 1965, too, the USSR and China began to provide economic assistance and military equipment to Hanoi. The U.S. bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail and retreating enemy troops in Cambodia. Bombing was stopped briefly on two occasions in an effort to bring about negotiations, but Hanoi's demand to seat the FLN (communist-controlled Front Liberation National) of South Vietnam at the conference table as a full and equal partner was rejected by the U.S. Raids were resumed with greater U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  In 1967 an important shift in Soviet policy occurred, indicating a desire to end the war. Each side began by softening its position, leading to cautious optimism. In the summer of 1967 a North Vietnamese offensive undermined that appraisal. North Vietnam's attempt to turn the tide of the war and to place Hanoi and the Vietcong in a stronger position for negotiations led to an attack on a U.S. marine outpost near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Vietnam on 21 January 1968. The Vietcong announced a three-day truce from the 27th, but South Vietnam revealed its decision to continue the bombing of the North. During the Tet (lunar New Year) holiday the Vietcong launched its biggest offensive. On 30 January 1968 a Vietcong attack on Saigon, Hué, and 36 of the 44 provincial capitals in South Vietnam, along with military installations and district towns, triggered another intrawar crisis for South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese responded on 2 February by urging an extension of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam to cover all military objectives. After heavy fighting the Vietcong were expelled from all the towns into which they had infiltrated.  A state of martial law in the south was declared by President Thieu. In Saigon a 24-hour curfew was imposed so that the South Vietnam army could drive out the Vietcong unhindered by the civilian population. American infantry and tanks were rushed to the city on 1 February, and a U.S. general assumed control of the whole operation. The main Vietcong forces withdrew on 3 February; but on the 18th another attack was launched in and around the capital. Fighting continued until the 24th, when the Vietcong troops were expelled once more. This terminated the Tet crisis for South Vietnam. The U.S. ordered more combat troops into the area.  A pessimistic report on 27 February by the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, on the situation in Vietnam shocked Washington and triggered a U.S. crisis. President Johnson's major response to the Tet Offensive was an announcement on 31 March that he had ordered a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and had renewed a U.S. willingness to negotiate. This policy decision ended the U.S. crisis, for it marked the beginning of a fundamental change in Washington's appraisal of the Vietnam War.  The Vietcong was defeated militarily; but it scored a psychological and political victory. Its belief that a massive offensive against the cities and towns would demonstrate the weakness of the government in the South and bring about a general uprising of civilians proved wrong and caused its military defeat; but the battle raised public opposition in the U.S. to a new level of intensity. The president and his advisors were shocked by the suddenness and magnitude of the Tet Offensive; and this crisis proved to be a turning point on the American path to disengagement from Vietnam five years later.  The mediation efforts by UN Secretary-General U Thant during the Tet crisis proved ineffective. On 8 February 1968 U Thant met with a representative of the North Vietnamese government in New Delhi. A week later, a North Vietnamese diplomat informed U Thant that Hanoi would begin talks with the U.S. in return for an unconditional cessation of American bombings. Upon his return to the U.S., U Thant met with President Johnson and Ambassador Goldberg on 21 February. Johnson regarded the Secretary-General’s report as inconclusive and rejected North Vietnam’s request.  The Warsaw Pact condemned South Vietnam and the U.S. Soviet involvement included active military personnel in the antiaircraft operations by the North and the supply of arms to Hanoi.
This crisis between Israel and Jordan lasted from 18 to 22 March 1968. From 15 February to mid-March 1968 Israel reported 37 sabotage raids from Jordan causing death and injuries among Israeli soldiers and civilians. A crisis for Israel was triggered on 18 March when an Israeli school bus went over a mine near the Jordan border; two children were killed and 28 wounded. Defense Minister Dayan issued a warning to Jordan to prevent further border crossings by Palestinian feda'iyyun. The bus incident and Dayan's warning also triggered a crisis for Jordan: King Hussein stated that on that day he perceived a threat of full-scale invasion from Israel. Israel's response was a raid on the village of Karameh, a feda'iyyun base in Jordan, on 21 March. There was also an appeal to the United Nations. The Jordanian response was to dispatch armed forces to the site. Heavy fighting followed, with severe losses on both sides. Israel's crisis ended when its forces withdrew on 21 March. Jordan's crisis ended the following day, when it reopened the Allenby bridge linking the Israel-occupied West Bank and Jordan.  UN activity took the form of a discussion in the Security Council; no resolution was passed. Both the U.S. and the USSR were politically active in this crisis, with little effect.
There were six actors in the Prague Spring crisis: East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. It lasted from 9 April to 18 October 1968. During late 1967 domestic unrest and political conflict within the Czechoslovak Communist Party led to the overthrow of Antonin Novotny as First Secretary of the Communist Party on 5 January 1968 and as the State President on 23 March 1968. Alexander Dubcek, his successor as party leader, proposed an "Action Program" that was accepted by the Czechoslovak Party Central Committee. The program proposed solutions to the Czech. economic crisis, the Slovak question, the rehabilitation of party leaders sentenced during the purges of the 1950s, and a way to deal with the dissent of students and intellectuals. Censorship was abolished, economic controls and central planning by the government were reduced and restructured, and new members were appointed to political posts. A more independent foreign policy was pledged, but it would conform to the interests of the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO) in general and the USSR in particular.  Polish leader Wladyslaw Gomulka and East German leader Walter Ulbricht feared that the infection of liberalism, already in its early stages in their countries, would spread and undermine their respective positions. In the Soviet Union apprehension increased that the "Prague Spring" would encourage Ukrainian nationalist sentiment; and the possibility emerged that liberalization would spill over into neighboring states. Furthermore, the unity and strength of the Warsaw Pact as a whole were seen to be in jeopardy with Czechoslovakia's decreased reliability as an ally. The possibility of military intervention in Czechoslovakia alarmed Hungary and Bulgaria, which perceived a threat to their own political regimes.  Warsaw Pact delegates met in Dresden in March 1968 to discuss the situation. Military exercises of the WTO were decided upon, to be held in June 1968. The publication of Czechoslovakia's Action Program on 9 April 1968 triggered a crisis for East Germany and Poland. A crisis was triggered for Bulgaria and Hungary on 8 May after they had participated in a meeting with delegates from the Soviet Union, Poland, and East Germany: it was at that time that Bulgaria and Hungary became seriously alarmed over the situation in Czechoslovakia, since military intervention now appeared as a very real possibility. The stability of East Europe, including Bulgaria's own regime, seemed at stake. Hungary was concerned over the possibility of having to participate in a military attack initiated by the Soviet Union and East Germany.  An open letter in Prague on 27 June, "Two Thousand Words," which called for the speeding up of Czechoslovak democratization and criticizing the conditions inside the Czechoslovak Communist Party prior to the January reforms, triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union: Moscow interpreted this letter as proof that the political situation in Czechoslovakia was out of control. Due to increasing tension, the Warsaw Pact Command delayed removing its troops from Czechoslovakia upon completion of the military exercises held there.  The responses of Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, and East Germany were contained in an ultimatum to Czechoslovakia on 15 July. A letter, signed by the USSR and these four East European states, singled out the Two Thousand Words manifesto as a threat to the vital interests of the whole communist community. When the Czechoslovak head of defense and security criticized the Warsaw Pact structure, the USSR demanded his dismissal. Dubcek acceded, signaling that military resistance was no longer a realistic option for Czechoslovakia. Intense diplomatic negotiations followed at a meeting held between Czechoslovak leaders and nine of the 11 members of the Soviet Politburo. The result was verbal promises to resolve the crisis, confirmed on 3 August by the Bratislava Declaration. WTO troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia but remained concentrated along its borders.  Ulbricht met with Dubcek on 12 August and reported to the Soviet Politburo that the Czechoslovak leaders were unwilling to live up to the terms of the Bratislava agreement. Reports about the enthusiastic reception in Prague of Yugoslav President Tito and Romanian party leader Ceaucescu irritated the Soviets, who feared Czechoslovak influence on other Pact members that might undermine their loyalty to the Soviet Union. The major response of the Soviet Union, East Germany, and Poland to the crisis, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, was decided on 17 August after three days of talks among their military leaders.  Dubcek, who continued to disregard unmistakable signs of a new Soviet debate on Czechoslovakia and who did not wish to create anti-Soviet feelings, did not inform the Czechoslovak President, Svoboda, about warnings received from Hungarian leader Kádár or those contained in a letter from the Soviet Politburo on 19 August. The invasion of Czechoslovakia began on 20 August. It was the crisis trigger for Czechoslovakia and the termination date for Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, and Poland. The Warsaw Pact armies acquired total control of Czechoslovak territory within 36 hours. The Czechoslovak response, on the 21st, was compliance. Svoboda flew to Moscow for talks with the Soviet leadership and pressed for the release of Czechoslovak leaders Dubcek, Cerník, and Smrkovska, who had been taken prisoner during the invasion. With Czechoslovak promises to control and arrest "counterrevolutionary" elements, the Moscow Protocol was signed on 18 October 1968 legalizing the presence of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia and terminating the crisis for the USSR and Czechoslovakia.  The destruction of the Czechoslovak reform movement was viewed as a victory by Bulgaria, East Germany, Poland, and the USSR. However, Hungary was not pleased by the triumph of the hard-liners within the Soviet bloc, since it might threaten Hungary's own modest reform movement.  A UN Security Council draft resolution censuring the invasion as a violation of the UN Charter was vetoed by the Soviet Union on 21 August.  U.S. President Johnson condemned the Soviet actions and canceled all diplomatic activities scheduled with the USSR regarding future SALT I (Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) talks. NATO foreign ministers discussed the situation on 8 October, but no meaningful decisions were taken.
A crisis for Guyana, in a long-standing territorial dispute with Venezuela, occurred from 9 July to sometime in August 1968. British Guiana (since 1966, Guyana) and Venezuela have long disputed a large tract of territory contiguous to the Essequibo River. In 1899 an arbitral tribunal awarded the bulk of the territory, 45,000 of 53,000 square miles, to British Guiana. Venezuela accepted the award in 1905--until 1962 when, at the UN General Assembly, it pressed for a revision of the boundary. Venezuela claimed the entire disputed territory, which comprised 62 percent of British Guiana's total land base. Venezuela recognized Guiana's independence in 1966 and participated with British Guiana and the U.K. in a tripartite commission to resolve the dispute within four years. On 9 July 1968 Dr. Raul Leoni, President of Venezuela, issued a decree that annexed to Venezuela the territorial waters lying from three to 12 miles along the coast of the Guyana Essequibo. Venezuelan naval craft were later reported patrolling outside the three-mile limit. Guyana's response was a protest note to Venezuela, a complaint to UN Secretary-General U Thant, protests to Latin American members of the United Nations, and a complaint by Guyana's foreign minister to President Johnson. It was reported that, although the U.S. wanted to maintain a neutral position in the dispute, it did appeal to Venezuela to revoke the decree. Guyana declared Venezuela's decree to be null and void and announced that it would resist an invasion by Venezuela. The crisis faded in August 1968.  UN Secretary-General U Thant served as a facilitative mediator through the use of his good offices, which provided a forum for the crisis actors to negotiate. However, it appears that U Thant’s efforts were generally ineffective in hastening crisis abatement.. Barbados expressed concern about Venezuela's contemplated use of force in a Note from its prime minister to the foreign minister of Venezuela.  (There were minor military incidents in the disputed territory in 1969 and 1970--until Guyana, Venezuela, and the U.K. formally agreed in the Trinidad Protocol on 18 June 1970 to a 12-year "cooling-off period" on the border dispute [see Case #325--Essequibo II].)
A crisis for Lebanon began on 28 December 1968. The crisis ended sometime in January 1969. On 26 December 1968 the Lebanon-based PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) attacked an Israeli civilian plane at Athens International Airport. One passenger was killed. Israel's policy had long been to retaliate against the host country in the hope of compelling the Arab states to restrain Palestinian attacks on Israeli citizens and property. The crisis trigger for Lebanon was Israel's retaliation raid on Beirut International Airport on 28 December 1968, destroying 13 jetliners belonging to the Middle East Airlines and other Lebanese-owned planes. There was no loss of life. The Lebanese security forces did not intervene. Lebanon's major response, the following day, was a complaint against Israel to the Security Council. Two days later Lebanon declared a state of alert and mobilized reserve forces. The raid on Beirut accentuated Lebanon's civil tensions and triggered an internal political crisis in that country. The international crisis ended some time in January 1969.  There was widespread condemnation of the Israeli raid, including a protest by the Vatican. On 7 January 1969 France reiterated its policy of a total embargo on all military supplies destined for Israel. The U.S. offered aid to Lebanon and put its Sixth Fleet on low-level alert. The Soviet Union confined its political activity to statements at the United Nations. The Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel.
A North Vietnam countrywide offensive against the South led to a crisis for the United States and South Vietnam from 22 February until 8 June 1969. The 1968 Tet Offensive broke the stalemate that had existed in the Vietnam War since 1966. Thereafter U.S. policy underwent several changes. President Johnson restricted U.S. bombing to south of the 20th Parallel and offered to begin negotiations with North Vietnam, which responded favorably. Agreement was reached to begin talks in Paris. In October 1968 the U.S. announced that all air, naval, and artillery attacks against North Vietnam would be halted on 1 November. The U.S. also agreed to allow representatives of the (South Vietnam) Vietminh National Liberation Front to participate in the talks, despite South Vietnam objections. Nevertheless, while war raged, all parties maintained inflexible positions at the talks. On 20 January 1969 Richard Nixon was inaugurated as President of the United States. On 22 February 1969 Hanoi launched an offensive into South Vietnam, the day before a scheduled Nixon visit to Europe, triggering a crisis for the U.S. According to Nixon the offensive was a deliberate test, clearly designed to take the measure of the new Nixon administration. On 23 February Nixon ordered the bombing of sanctuaries in Cambodia but canceled the order two days later upon the recommendation of National Security Advisor Kissinger. On 4 March orders were once more given, only to be retracted on the 7th. Meanwhile U.S. casualties were mounting. Finally, as the North Vietnam attack continued, and U.S. casualties remained intolerably high, Nixon reverted to his earlier decisions; and on 15 March orders were given to bomb Cambodian sanctuaries ("Operation Menu"). These orders were carried out three days later, terminating the U.S. crisis. Thereafter there was a steady decline in U.S. casualties in Vietnam.  The secret bombing of Vietcong sanctuaries in Cambodia put military pressure on the North Vietnamese. Nevertheless, they were still able to launch a major attack throughout South Vietnam on 12 May 1969: it contained the largest number of strikes since the Tet Offensive. These attacks catalyzed a crisis for South Vietnam. The crisis was accentuated by Nixon's 14 May speech in which he elaborated an eight-point peace plan for Vietnam that included the setting of a precise timetable for withdrawal and a cease-fire under international supervision.  Saigon's fears about U.S. intentions and a possible change in the military balance, which would threaten South Vietnam's existence, caused President Thieu to object strongly to U.S. proposals for withdrawal from South Vietnam. On 17 May Thieu responded by calling for a meeting with Nixon in order to coordinate a common policy. Nixon and Thieu met on 8 June on Midway Island. Nixon's assurances that day of steadfast U.S. support terminated the crisis for South Vietnam. After the meeting Nixon announced the redeployment of 25,000 U.S. troops from Vietnam. Although Thieu was appeased by U.S. guarantees, he perceived the withdrawal as an irreversible process that would end with the departure of all American forces from Vietnam.  There was no UN or USSR activity, although Secretary-General U Thant issued a statement applauding the peace efforts of both sides.  SEATO and CENTO meetings were held in May at which the Vietnam War was reviewed.
There were many border incidents between the Soviet Union and China from the late 1950s onward. One reached crisis proportions, at the Ussuri River from 2 March to 20 October 1969. The ideological rivalry between the PRC and the USSR surfaced with Khrushchev's accession to power in the Soviet Union in 1955. His "de-Stalinization" speech at the 1956 Soviet Communist Party Congress exacerbated the rift. And an open split between Maoist China and post-Stalinist Russia crystallized at the conference of world Communist parties in 1960. Border talks in 1964 were unilaterally suspended by China. In 1965 the USSR initiated a military buildup along China's borders. The impact of China's traumatic Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s was still fresh. There had been large population transfers from urban to rural areas in China. The Prague Spring crisis had terminated with a Soviet-bloc invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (see Case #227, in Europe: Non-PCs). And by 1969 Soviet preoccupation with Berlin had subsided, allowing Moscow to concentrate on China.  For several years before the 1969 crisis there had been clashes along the Sino/Soviet border, notably in January, on 7-9 and 23 December 1967, and in late January 1968. On 16 February 1969 the Chinese became aware that Soviet forces along the Ussuri River had been placed on the highest alert. A foreign policy crisis for the USSR, as distinct from an incident, was initiated by a Chinese ambush of Soviet troops on 2 March 1969. Moscow's response, which triggered a crisis for China, was a massive attack on 15 March against Chinese forces stationed along the Ussuri River. China responded militarily the day of the attack. There were considerable casualties on both sides. Tension continued along the border, but there were no further military hostilities.  Following the clashes there were mass demonstrations in Beijing and in Moscow. On 29 March the USSR issued the first of a series of moderate diplomatic notes urging China to negotiate. A joint Sino/Soviet Commission to regulate navigation on border rivers reconvened on 11 May and reached agreement on 8 August 1969. At the same time, clashes continued--on 16, 17, and 25 April, 2, 12-15, 20, 25, and 28 May, 10-11 June, 8 and 20 July, and 13 August. That day, too, the Soviets threatened to bomb China's nuclear facilities situated several thousand miles away in the remote province of Sinkiang. Beijing then agreed to negotiate on the larger border problems between the two countries.  After the Sinkiang threat, a brief meeting took place on 11 September between Premiers Kosygin and Zhou Enlai. Negotiations on Sino/Soviet border disputes began on 20 October, marking the termination date for both crisis actors. The talks proved to be inconclusive. But while the conflict continued, the polemics had been considerably toned down.  (There were several minor border incidents in subsequent years, notably in 1978.) U.S. activity was limited to political statements. The Warsaw Treaty Organization met, but it had no effect on abating the crisis. The UN remained aloof.
Israel, Egypt, and the USSR were the actors in this two-stage crisis-war from 8 March 1969 until 7 August 1970. During the June Six Day War of 1967 (see Case #222) Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula, along with the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. In the autumn of 1968 Egypt's leaders perceived that the strategic balance had turned in its favor permitting a limited military initiative against Israel along the Canal. Accordingly Egyptian artillery bombarded Israeli positions on the east bank of the Canal in September and October. Israel responded with a display of force--the destruction of Egypt's power station at Naj Hamadi on 31 October. Egypt desisted from further military activity; and several months of tranquility followed on the Sinai front. On 8 March 1969 Egypt launched the War of Attrition with intense artillery fire against Israel's "Bar Lev Line" on the east side of the Canal. This triggered a crisis for Israel. After heightened losses in May, June, and July, Israel responded with air raids into Egypt on 20 July catalyzing a crisis for Egypt. As a result a planned Egyptian offensive to cross the Canal was set aside. Israeli threat perceptions declined. And when Israeli air raids were suspended on 28 July the first crisis for both actors, along with the first stage of the War of Attrition, came to an end.  The fighting escalated in October, when Israeli air raids destroyed SAM-2 batteries and Egyptian antiaircraft systems. But the catalyst to the second stage of the crisis-war and an intra-war crisis for Egypt was Israeli deep-penetration raids into Egypt beginning on 7 January 1970. Nasir, concerned that the raids might generate domestic pressure that would endanger his regime, appealed to the Soviet Union for aid: during a visit to Moscow starting on 22 January he requested Soviet military advisors and the introduction of a sophisticated missile air defense system into Egypt. Nasir's threat to resign if his requests were not met triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. It responded favorably: by 19 March Soviet missile batteries were installed in Egypt near the Canal triggering Israel's second--intrawar--crisis of the War of Attrition. Israel responded with intensive bombing of these antiaircraft sites on 24 March. And in a rare direct Israeli encounter with Soviet military personnel during the entire Arab/Israel conflict Israeli- and Soviet-piloted aircraft clashed on 18 April.  Intense U.S. pressure led to a cease-fire on 7 August based upon Secretary of State Rogers's Plan "B" (19 June 1970) terminating the War of Attrition. Rogers's Plan "A" (9 December 1969), designed to bring about a peaceful solution on the principle of land for peace, remained unfulfilled until the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty of 1979.  Big Four talks--the U.S., the USSR, the U.K., and France--under the auspices of the UN contributed marginally to crisis abatement. The Soviet Union supplied arms and missiles to Egypt and influenced it to abandon plans for a cross-Canal military operation in 1969. In addition to mediation efforts the U.S. also employed delaying tactics in the delivery of Phantom jets to Israel as a form of pressure to accept a cease-fire. On the whole both superpowers played an important role in crisis management. The Arab League held a conference in December 1969 but had no impact on the crisis outcome.
The second crisis for Iran and Iraq over the Shatt-al-Arab lasted from 15 April to 30 October 1969. Iran's crisis was triggered on 15 April 1969 when its ambassador to Baghdad was informed by Iraq's deputy foreign minister that Iraq regarded the Shatt-al-Arab as part of its territory and requested ships flying Iran's flag to lower their flag when entering the estuary. Furthermore, no Iranian nationals were to be aboard. If the demands were not met, Iraq would use force and would not allow vessels destined for Iranian ports to use the river. Iran responded on 19 April by declaring the 1937 treaty null and void and demanded its renegotiation. Iran's deputy foreign minister warned that any violation of Iran's sovereign rights would be met with full retaliation. The nullification of the 1937 treaty was the crisis trigger for Iraq. On 20 April Iraq responded by reiterating the validity of the treaty and reserved the right to take legal and legitimate action. Iran then concentrated its forces around Khorramshahr and Abadan and put its navy on full alert, while Iraqi forces were placed on alert at the port of Basra.  On 22 April, as a show of force, Iran sent a freighter through the Shatt, escorted by naval craft and protected by an umbrella of jet fighters. It was the first Iranian vessel to pass through the Shatt flying Iran's flag since the outbreak of the crisis. An Iraqi naval launch allowed the vessel to go through. This act constituted the Iraqi response to the crisis. Another escorted Iranian vessel passed through the Shatt unmolested on the 25th.  On 28 April Iraq circulated a document to UN delegates complaining of Iran's actions in the Shatt-al-Arab. This charge was answered on 5 May by Iran, which appealed to the UN Secretary-General to send a representative to Iran in order to witness the influx of Iranians expelled from Iraq who had been subjected to inhumane treatment by Iraqi authorities. Notes were also sent to the Security Council. During October the addresses to the General Assembly by the foreign ministers of both states contained accusations against one another in the Shatt-al-Arab crisis. The CENTO Ministerial Council conferred in Teheran on 26 and 27 May and issued a signed communiqué by Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S., disclosing discussion of the dispute.  The crisis ended on 30 October 1969 when the information ministers of Iran and Iraq decided to terminate the propaganda campaign against each other, with the hope that this would prepare the atmosphere for a peaceful settlement between the two countries. Several Middle East states attempted to mediate: Jordan, Kuwait, Sa'udi Arabia, and Turkey. Whereas Iraq was ready to accept mediation, Iran was not. A full-scale war between Iran and Iraq, catalyzed by the Shatt-al-Arab dispute, was to break out in September 1980 (See Case #317).  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
A crisis between El Salvador and Honduras began on 15 June and terminated on 30 July 1969. Honduras, a sparsely populated country, was the domicile of large numbers of Salvadorans who, since the 1920s, had left overcrowded El Salvador to farm, squat, or work on the banana plantations of Honduras. Reports of their ill-treatment were brought to the attention of El Salvador. In Honduras the economic situation at the end of the 1960s was bleak, with societal unrest increasing. The first football (soccer) game between teams of the two countries in the elimination rounds of the 1970 World Cup Championship was played in the Honduras capital, Tegucigalpa, on 8 June 1969. Following the opener, Salvadoran players complained of suffering at the hands of their hosts. Violence in the stadium followed. In the next game, on 15 June in San Salvador, Honduran players were subjected to reciprocal treatment by their hosts, and riots broke out once again. The aftermath of the second football game, combined with reports from large numbers of Salvadoran refugees fleeing from Honduras and alleging maltreatment and confiscation of property, triggered a crisis for El Salvador on 15 June 1969. El Salvador declared a state of alert, and Foreign Minister Francisco Jose Guerrero appealed to the OAS, claiming that 12,000 Salvadorans had been expelled from Honduras.  On 26 and 27 June diplomatic relations between the two states were broken. Tension, accompanied by incidents along the border, continued until El Salvador's major response: troops crossed into Honduras on 14 July.  Honduras responded the same day with air attacks on Salvadoran cities and ports. A cease-fire, due to effective OAS mediation, came about on 18 July. By this time casualties on both sides exceeded 2,000.  El Salvador's victories led to the conquest of sizable chunks of Honduran territory from which it refused to withdraw after the cease-fire. Subsequent threats of OAS sanctions against El Salvador convinced it to do so. A compromise agreement, brokered by the OAS secretary-general, came into effect on 30 July 1969, marking the termination of the crisis.  The U.S. embargo on arms to both countries was perceived by Honduras as favoring the better equipped Salvadoran army. At the same time, there was U.S. pressure on El Salvador to withdraw from the Honduran territory it had invaded. Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua attempted to mediate at the beginning of the crisis, but without success.  The UN offered its good offices. The USSR was not involved.  (Thirteen years after the Football (Soccer) War the International Court of Justice ruled in favor of Honduras, awarding it two-thirds of the disputed territory. And another 13 years passed until, in the summer of 1995, El Salvador and Honduras agreed to begin demarcating their border.)
Syria's acquiescence in Palestinian Arab guerrilla activity caused a crisis for Lebanon from 22 October to 3 November 1969. The political equilibrium within Lebanon was endangered when Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrilla groups, based in Lebanon or infiltrating from across the Syrian border, stepped up their sabotage operations against Israel, bringing about retaliations in 1968. For some time clashes between forces of the Lebanon government and Palestinian guerrillas had been taking place. The clashes always centered around the issues that occupied Lebanon in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, namely, the PLO's right to maintain bases in Lebanon and its demands to be allowed to operate from Lebanese soil against targets in Israel. Following an Israeli raid on Beirut's International Airport (see Case #229, in Arab/Israel PC) political upheavals in April 1969 left Lebanon with a caretaker government for seven months. Syrian intervention posed an ever-present threat to its political regime. On 22 October 1969 the PLO announced that serious clashes had occurred with Lebanese government forces after an attack on its bases in the south along the Israel border. This triggered a crisis for Lebanon. While continuing its military response against the guerrillas, Beirut began meetings with representatives of Egypt and Jordan on the 24th. Syria, which closed its border with Lebanon on 22 October and concentrated military units there, was also approached by Lebanon for negotiation, in a telephone conversation between the two presidents a day earlier. Ultimately, Egypt served as the primary mediator in the crisis, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Lebanese army, Bustani, and the Secretary General of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, Sadaka, flew to Cairo on 29 October to participate in negotiations. The crisis ended on 3 November when an agreement was reached between the Lebanese army and government and the PLO in Cairo, under the mediation of President Nasir.  The Cairo Agreement granted the PLO wide-ranging rights to operate as a "state within a state" in Lebanon. Formally, it contained a modus operandi for the guerrilla groups, limiting their bases to the southeastern corner of Lebanon, as well as their sabotage operations against Israel. However, the overall effect was to curtail the sovereignty of Lebanon and its government's control over its own territory.
A crisis over Cambodia occurred from 13 March to 22 July 1970. The crisis actors were North Vietnam, Cambodia, South Vietnam, and the United States. Despite Cambodia's declaration of neutrality in the ongoing war in Indochina, eastern Cambodia was being used by the Vietcong (Front Liberation National or FLN) and North Vietnamese as a base for launching military operations against South Vietnam. From March 1969 the United States had been secretly bombing enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia. As a result, the Vietcong began to move deeper into Cambodia, bringing them into increasing conflict with Cambodian authorities. The situation, coupled with Cambodia's deepening economic crisis, placed ruling Prince Sihanouk in a precarious position. On 8 March and again on the 11th, while Sihanouk was in France for medical treatment, there were violent demonstrations in Phnom Penh demanding the removal of Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. These demonstrations were denounced by Sihanouk. On 12 March the two houses of the Cambodian parliament met in a joint session and adopted a resolution condemning the presence of the Vietcong and North Vietnamese on Cambodian territory and demanding that the Cambodian army be expanded. On 12 March an announcement was made suspending the trade agreement that allowed the Vietnamese to use Sihanoukville Port and purchase supplies in Cambodia. A crisis for North Vietnam was triggered on 13 March 1970 when the Cambodian foreign ministry sent notes to the Vietcong provisional government and to the North Vietnam government demanding that all Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops be withdrawn from Cambodia within 48 hours. Sihanouk left Paris for meetings in Moscow with President Podgorny and Premier Kosygin in order to get their support in persuading Hanoi and the FLN to curb their activities in Cambodia. On 18 March he traveled to Beijing for the same reason. That day the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Prince Sihanouk. The following day it declared a state of emergency, suspending a number of civil liberties. On the 21st Cheng Heng became the new Head of State.  The crisis trigger for Cambodia came on 23 March when Sihanouk issued a proclamation dissolving the new government in Cambodia and announcing his intention of forming a Government of National Union and a National Liberation Army. Mass demonstrations in support of Sihanouk began on 26 March, with the Cambodian armed forces being placed on alert. Vietcong troops moved deeper into Cambodia; and on 31 March North Vietnam responded to the crisis by attacking a Cambodian regiment 100 miles northeast of Phnom Penh and five miles from the frontier, marking the beginning of the combined Vietcong, North Vietnamese, and Sihanoukist invasion of Cambodia. By early April these forces had reached the Svay Rieng province known as "Parrot's Beak," which was surrounded by South Vietnam territory on three sides.  The crisis trigger for South Vietnam occurred on 10 April when Cambodian troops were forced to evacuate border positions in Parrot's Beak. Cambodia's major response to the crisis came on the 14th, when Premier Lon Nol stated that, due to the gravity of the situation, the Cambodian government was prepared to accept foreign aid from all sources. A request was sent to the United States the next day and again on 20 April.  The U.S. crisis began on 21 April when communist forces attacked the town of Takeo, cutting the road connecting it with Phnom Penh. The U.S. response, on the 28th, was a decision by Nixon to send U.S. troops into Cambodia. South Vietnam's response, the next day, was to send troops into Cambodia. U.S. troops remained in Cambodia until 30 June 1970, the termination date for North Vietnam and the United States. The crisis for Cambodia and South Vietnam ended on 22 July with the beginning of South Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia.  Although Nixon termed the campaign a complete success, the situation in Cambodia remained more or less the same. South Vietnam obtained a victory in Parrot's Beak, and North Vietnam obtained a strong foothold in Cambodia.  The UN was approached by Cambodia on 30 March. Secretary-General U Thant proposed peace negotiations, but this had no effect on ending the crisis.  The USSR continued to provide political support to North Vietnam.
This Middle East crisis took place from 15 to 29 September 1970. There were four crisis actors: Syria, the United States, Israel, and Jordan. Palestinian guerrilla forces, encamped in Jordan, were creating serious internal problems for King Hussein throughout 1970. In June major fighting occurred in Amman between the PLO and the Jordan Legion. The king was forced to agree to full freedom of movement for the guerrillas. During the summer of 1970 there were more sporadic clashes. On 1 September Palestinian guerrillas sought to assassinate King Hussein for a second time in a period of three months. Fighting broke out immediately between Palestinians and King Hussein's forces in Jordan. After an unsuccessful attempt to hijack an Israeli plane on 4 September, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked two civilian aircraft on the 6th, belonging to Switzerland and the U.S., and forced them to land on a desert strip outside Amman. Three days later a British (BOAC) plane was rerouted to join the other two. The PFLP hijackings were attempts to force the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Switzerland and the U.K. A crisis for Syria and the U.S. was triggered on 15 September 1970 by King Hussein's announcement of a drastic change in his cabinet, which would now include military personnel. His intention to confront the PLO challenge seemed clear. The U.S. feared the loss of an ally if Hussein were overthrown, and Syria perceived a decline in its influence in the region if the Palestinians were defeated. Syria responded on 19 September by invading Jordan, triggering a crisis for Jordan and Israel. Jordan's response was immediate; it engaged in battle with the Syrian forces the same day and appealed to the U.S. for aid. Israel, at a cabinet meeting on 20 September, decided upon military action, if necessary, in order to prevent a Palestinian victory in Jordan, which was perceived as a grave threat to Israel's influence and security. The United States response was a decision on 21 September to provide umbrella support to Israel if the USSR and Egypt became involved; and National Security Advisor Kissinger, together with Israel's Ambassador to the U.S. (and former Chief of Staff), Rabin, worked out a possible joint plan of military action. This plan was approved by President Nixon. For Syria and the U.S., the crisis escalated with the entry of the Jordanian air force against the Palestinians on the 22nd. All Syrian tanks were withdrawn from Jordanian territory that day. As a result the Palestinian guerrillas were forced to leave Jordan; and they subsequently built strongholds in southern Lebanon.  The League of Arab States met in Cairo at Nasir's initiative, and a Jordan/Syria cease-fire agreement was signed on 27 September. The mediation efforts at the Cairo summit were effective in leading to crisis abatement because they were able to bring about a more compromising Jordanian stance and avoided pushing King Hussein to a point in which he would align with the U.S. and Israel. While Hussein's victory was acknowledged, the agreement was a face-saving gesture for Syria because its forces had already been withdrawn, following a U.S.-backed Israeli threat to intervene militarily in support of Jordan. A declaration was issued supporting the rights of the Palestinians. The cease-fire was implemented on the 29th, which marked the termination date for all the crisis actors.  During the course of the crisis the U.S. placed airborne divisions in Germany and the U.S. on semi-alert status. Ships of the Sixth Fleet were reported to be heading toward Lebanese shores, and the aircraft carrier Saratoga was ordered to the eastern Mediterranean. USSR involvement in the crisis consisted of political statements calling for a cease-fire and warning against outside intervention while pressuring Syria to pull out of Jordan. The Soviets also monitored U.S. naval operations off the Syrian coast.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
This Cold War crisis for the United States occurred from 16 September to 23 October 1970. U-2 intelligence flights over Cuba had been conducted by the U.S. since the Missile crisis of 1962 (see Case #196). In 1968 a Soviet naval squadron visited Cienfuegos in Cuba. On 2 and 9 September 1970 two more Soviet naval visits took place. The Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Dobrynin, met with National Security Advisor Kissinger in August to determine U.S. intentions in light of the 1962 agreement on Cuba. In September U-2 planes picked up the first information on Soviet construction of a nuclear submarine base at Cienfuegos. Kissinger informed President Nixon on 16 September 1970 that U.S. intelligence flights had substantiated reports about construction of the Soviet base, the trigger for a U.S. crisis. Nixon warned Foreign Minister Gromyko that the U.S. was monitoring events carefully. On 25 September the story broke in the U.S. press. The U.S. major response, that day, was a warning from Kissinger to Dobrynin and a demand for an explanation. Dobrynin's answer, on the 27th, was that there had not been a violation of the 1962 agreement since no offensive weapons had been installed at Cienfuegos. At another meeting with Kissinger on 5 October, Dobrynin reaffirmed the validity of the 1962 agreement. Kissinger asked for a definition of a "base." On 13 October a Tass news agency communiqué denied that the Soviet Union was building a base in Cuba. Reports in the U.S. confirmed that a submarine tender had left Cienfuegos. On 22 October Gromyko, at a meeting with Nixon, reaffirmed the 1962 agreement once again. U-2 photos revealed a slowdown, and later a halt, in construction. On 23 October the U.S. crisis ended when Washington received a Soviet assurance that construction had been halted and that the Soviet naval force had left Cienfuegos.  The UN remained aloof during this crisis.  (The dispute continued until the spring of 1971, but tension decreased substantially, and the docking of Soviet submarines at other Cuban harbors was not perceived as a military threat to the United States.)
A crisis for the Republic of Guinea took place from 22 November to 11 December 1970. Guinean President Sekou Touré alleged Portuguese assassination attempts on his life during January and July 1964 and October 1970. Portugal accused the Republic of Guinea of harboring guerrillas wishing to oust Lisbon from the neighboring colonial territory of Portuguese Guinea (later Guinea-Bissau). On 22 November 1970, the trigger date, Radio Conakry of the Republic of Guinea announced an invasion by mercenaries from several sanctuaries, especially from the colonial territory of Portuguese Guinea. The same day, President Sekou Touré responded with force and appealed, on 22 and 23 November, for an emergency meeting of the Security Council and for troops from the United Nations and the OAU for "covert support."  The Security Council met from 22 to 24 November and called for the cessation of the attack and the withdrawal of the invading forces. It was decided to send a fact-finding commission to Guinea. The mission visited Guinea from 25 to 29 November. Its report, confirming the invasion of 350-400 men on 22 November and alleging support from an outside power, which seemed to be Portugal, was published on 4 December. The report also stated that the invasion was aimed at the overthrow of Sekou Touré, the freeing of Portuguese prisoners in the Republic of Guinea, and the weakening of the guerrilla forces who were active in Portuguese Guinea. Portugal rejected the UN report and denied participation in the invasion.  On 25 November Sekou Touré appealed to all friendly countries for military support. Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone offered to send troops. There were further incursions into Guinea by land on 27 November. Tanzania, Zambia, and the U.S. sent economic aid. Egypt sent arms and ammunition. Algeria and Libya were also reported to have sent military supplies. Political support for Guinea came from China, India, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and the Soviet Union. The Security Council passed a resolution on 8 December, the Western powers abstaining, warning Portugal against further attacks on African states, and called for immediate self-determination and independence for Portuguese Guinea. The termination date of the crisis was 11 December 1970, the day the Organization of African Unity (OAU) passed a unanimous resolution, initiated by Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, and Sudan, condemning Portugal and demanding reparations to Guinea. There was a subsequent tacit agreement to end the invasion.  (Portuguese Guinea became Guinea Bissau after it achieved independence in 1974.)
This intrawar crisis lasted from 8 February until 25 March 1971. The two crisis actors were Laos and North Vietnam. A major North Vietnamese offensive was expected in 1972. U.S. and South Vietnamese military planners therefore scheduled an invasion of Laos, in order to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, through which the North Vietnamese transported supplies to their strongholds in South Vietnam and Cambodia. The invasion was to be carried out by South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support. Although Laos had been neutralized by the Geneva Protocols of 1954 and 1962, there were thousands of North Vietnamese troops operating there, along with the Pathet Lao communist guerrillas. During the crisis Nixon announced that action to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail had been under consideration since 1965. The South Vietnam-U.S. invasion of Laos began on 8 February 1971. This triggered a crisis for Laos, whose borders and neutrality had been violated, and for North Vietnam, against which the invasion was directed. The major response by Laos was a declaration of a state of emergency on 12 February. North Vietnam, too, responded that day by beginning the first wave of a counteroffensive. A day earlier the International Control Commission (ICC) had convened at the urgent request of Canada in order to initiate an investigation into the violation of Laotian neutrality by foreign forces. The ICC reached no conclusion.  At that time Paris was hosting talks among the U.S., South Vietnam, and North Vietnam. South Vietnam stated that there could be no negotiations while North Vietnamese troops remained in Laos.  From the beginning to the middle of March South Vietnamese forces launched a drive to move further into Laos. On 7 March Tchepone, a key town in the Trail network, was captured. It was recaptured after a second major counteroffensive was launched by North Vietnamese troops on 12 March. The U.S. began to airlift South Vietnamese troops out of Laos by mid-March. This was completed by 25 March, the termination date for both crisis actors.  Soviet activity was limited to declarations against the U.S. and South Vietnam. The United States gave South Vietnam air support but announced that it would not use any ground forces. It repeatedly denied support to a possible South Vietnam invasion of the North. The only UN activity was an appeal by Secretary-General U Thant for Laos/Pathet Lao negotiations.
The crisis over Bangladesh took place from 25 March to 17 December 1971; Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India were the crisis actors. When the British withdrew from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, West and East Pakistan were separated by 1,000 kilometers of Indian territory. Since 1958 Pakistan was ruled by a military junta led by Ayub Khan and, later, Yahya Khan. The overwhelming victory of the Awami League in the 1970 East Pakistan (East Bengal) elections for representatives to the Pakistan National Assembly placed Pakistan's political structure in jeopardy, especially the supremacy of the military-controlled executive over representative institutions, and West Pakistan's dominance over East Pakistan. Negotiations between the two principal political leaders, West Pakistan's Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Awami League's Sheikh Mujibar Rahman, including an offer of the prime ministership to the latter, failed to break the impasse.  In mid-February 1971 a decision was made by the military rulers in West Pakistan to suppress the growing fervor of East Bengali nationalism. Troops were posted to the East. On 1 March President Yahya Khan postponed the opening of the National Assembly. This was protested by the Awami League, which launched a noncooperation movement on the 6th. A declaration of Bangladesh's independence was scheduled for 6 March; but on that day Yahya Khan announced that the National Assembly would convene on 25 March. While the West Pakistani military buildup in East Pakistan continued, the Awami League took over civil administration of the region. On 25 March a crisis for Bangladesh (still formally known as East Pakistan and East Bengal) was triggered by a West Pakistani army attack on the student dormitories of Dacca University. The response, the following day, was a declaration of independence by East Bengali political leaders. This triggered a crisis for Pakistan, which responded the same day by outlawing the Awami League and suppressing the East Pakistan (East Bengal) revolt with violence. While fighting raged over the spring and summer, an estimated nine million refugees fled from Bangladesh to India, causing severe economic problems there. A number of these refugees were then trained and armed by India to fight the West Pakistanis.  Throughout the autumn of 1971 there were minor clashes between the Indian and Pakistani armies. The situation reached crisis proportions for India when, on 12 October, orders were given to concentrate Pakistani troops on the Indian Punjab border. On 21 November the Indian army crossed into West Pakistan, causing another crisis for Pakistan, already at war with Bangladesh. Pakistan responded on 3 December with an air attack on Indian airfields in Kashmir. Indian forces poised on the East Pakistan border overwhelmed the Pakistani troops in the seceding territory within a fortnight. The war ended on 17 December 1971 with Pakistan's surrender and the emergence of a new sovereign state on the Indian subcontinent.  The UN, approached by Bangladesh in March 1971, declared the problem an internal matter for Pakistan. The Security Council was the most active UN organ; it discussed the situation several times but was unable to pass a resolution, due to a Soviet veto. During the war between Pakistan and India, on 7 December, the General Assembly succeeded in passing a resolution calling for a cease-fire, which, although ignored by India, did have a marginal effect on abating the crisis. On 22 December the Security Council passed a compromise resolution calling for the withdrawal of all armed forces "as soon as practicable."  The most important Soviet activity was the signing of a Treaty of Friendship with India in August 1971, providing active support by a superpower in case of war with Pakistan. The USSR also moved naval vessels in the direction of the Bay of Bengal on 15 December, as a symbol of support for India. And it moved troops closer to the Sino/Soviet border in order to deter Beijing from becoming involved. Besides considerable U.S. political activity, its Seventh Fleet was moved into the Bay of Bengal on 13 December 1971, in support of Pakistan.
The first of four Chad/Libya crises in the 1970s lasted from 24 May 1971 to 17 April 1972. In an attempt at Christian-Muslim reconciliation, half of the portfolios in the Chad government were granted to Muslim politicians on 24 May 1971. This act created a crisis for Libya by threatening its future influence in the domestic affairs of its southern neighbor. The pro-Libyan FROLINAT rejected the Chad government's offer.  On 27 August Libya responded by backing a coup against President Tombalbaye. Although it failed, the coup attempt triggered a crisis for Chad, which responded the same day by severing diplomatic relations with Libya. The perceived threat to its regime having been overcome, Chad's crisis ended the following day. On 17 September Libya recognized FROLINAT's claim to being the legitimate government of Chad. However, persistent pressure on Libya by France bore fruit: on 17 April 1972 Libya resumed relations with Chad, marking the end of this international crisis.  There were two efforts at mediation, both involving President Diori of Niger. The first occurred from 18 September to 24 November 1971, in which Diori visited both capitals but was ultimately unsuccessful in attenuating the tension between Chad and Libya. The second mediation attempt took place from 31 March to 12 April 1972. After delegations from both Libya and Chad traveled to Niger to meet under the auspices of Diori, both sides indicated that the mediation had been worthwhile in a joint statement of gratitude for Diori’s efforts on 12 April.  The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
Zambia's crisis over the Caprivi Strip occurred from 5 to 12 October 1971. South Africa and Zambia share a common border along the Caprivi Strip, a long narrow strip of land in the far northeast corner of South Africa-ruled South-West Africa (later, Namibia). Large operational bases in the area were maintained by South African Defence and Police (SADP) forces against guerrilla infiltration. Economic conditions in Zambia deteriorated toward the end of 1970 when world copper prices were forced down. A crisis was triggered for Zambia on 5 October 1971 when South African Prime Minister John Vorster announced that a Union police vehicle along the Zambian border had been blown up by a land mine. He placed responsibility on Zambia, charging that it had made Zambia's territory available for "this sort of aggression." Units of the South African security forces crossed into Zambia in order to pursue alleged perpetrators. On 8 October Zambia requested a special session of the UN Security Council to discuss the "numerous violations of South African forces against the sovereignty, airspace and territorial integrity of Zambia." Zambia's President Kaunda announced that compulsory national service and Home Guards would reinforce the regular army as part of the country's defense system.  A Security Council resolution on the 12th, condemning South Africa and calling on it to respect the sovereignty of Zambia, terminated the crisis, although Zambia viewed the resolution as "watered down" and insufficient. Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Tanzania and Uganda began on 20 October and ended on 25 November 1971. On 25 January 1971, while Uganda President Milton Obote was out of the country, a coup took place and General Idi Amin assumed power. Obote took refuge in Tanzania where he was joined by about 1,000 loyal Ugandan soldiers. Other Ugandans fled to southern Sudan. Amin viewed Tanzania and Sudan as possible jump-off points for military operations against his regime. Sharp hostility existed between Tanzanian President Nyerere and Amin. On 7 July Amin closed the border with Tanzania, alleging that guerrillas had infiltrated from Tanzania into Uganda. Further allegations, in early August, pointed to Tanzanian violations of Ugandan airspace and tank and troop movements into Ugandan territory. On 24 August Amin announced that his troops had clashed with Chinese-led Tanzanian forces. More reports of troop movements and bombings followed, and by the end of September accusations were steadily exchanged between the two countries. A crisis for Tanzania began on 20 October 1971 when it was announced that Ugandan air force jet fighters had destroyed a Tanzanian military camp that was perceived by Amin as a base for ex-President Obote and his men. On 24 October Uganda claimed that Tanzania had mobilized its forces on the border between the two states, triggering a crisis for Uganda. The Tanzanian response was a statement by the minister of information and broadcasting the next day, objecting to the Ugandan threat to destroy Tanzanian bases established north of the Kagera River and declaring its intention to meet with resistance any troop movements in that area. Amin responded on 1 November with a declaration of his determination to defend "every inch of Ugandan territory." There is evidence that both Uganda and Tanzania had moved troops to the border.  On 21 November Amin reestablished air and telephone communications with Tanzania. The crisis ended for both actors on 25 November. Nyerere, though still refusing to recognize Amin, announced his intention to reduce the number of troops on the border. These unilateral acts terminated the crisis.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN remained aloof from this crisis.
South Vietnam, the United States, and North Vietnam were the crisis actors in a Vietnam intrawar crisis that lasted from 30 March to 19 July 1972. The period preceding the 1972 Vietnam Ports Mining crisis was marked by periodic escalation in fighting. Announcements of substantial U.S. troop withdrawals undermined the political strength of the U.S. at the Paris Peace Talks, conducted between Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese representatives Le Duc Tho and Xuan Thee. This crisis occurred during a U.S. presidential election year. At the same time there were ongoing demonstrations in the United States against the war in Vietnam. North Vietnam launched another spring offensive in South Vietnam on 30 March 1972, triggering a crisis for South Vietnam and the United States. South Vietnam, perceiving a threat of a further loss of territory, responded the same day with defensive fighting. The U.S. immediately renewed B-52 bombing of the Hanoi-Haiphong industrial complex. Despite these bombings, the North Vietnamese undertook further escalation on 24 April by initiating a renewed attack on South Vietnamese troops in the Central Highlands and forcing them to withdraw. The major U.S. response was an order by President Nixon on 8 May to mine all North Vietnamese ports in an effort to prevent military shipments from reaching North Vietnam by sea.  The announcement of the mining and blockade of the ports triggered a crisis for North Vietnam. Its response to the threat of isolation from crucial sources of supplies was a statement at the Paris Peace Talks on 9 May declaring the American act to be the gravest step so far in the escalation of the war, and that North Vietnam would never accept an American ultimatum. At the same time North Vietnamese delegates appealed to all governments and peoples of fraternal socialist countries to persuade the U.S. to negotiate seriously at the Paris talks.  The USSR and China played constructive roles in abating the crisis. Diplomatic talks between the U.S. and the USSR, including a summit meeting held in Moscow in May, resulted in intensive Soviet pressure on North Vietnam.  The crisis ended for all actors on 19 July 1972 with renewed talks in Paris: the negotiations shifted to a serious exchange of views, with a promise of compromise.  In a letter from UN Ambassador George Bush to the president of the Security Council on 8 May 1972, U.S. actions were reported to be measures of collective self-defense. Secretary-General Waldheim held a series of meetings at the Security Council between 8 and 10 May and advocated an active UN role in ending hostilities. However, he received no support. On 19 May the Security Council merely issued a statement calling on all the parties to act with utmost restraint.
A second crisis for Uganda and Tanzania began on 17 September 1972 and ended on 5 October of that year. Military clashes between Uganda and Tanzania were reported for much of 1971. The two countries verged on a wider confrontation when Ugandan air force planes attacked border placements in Tanzania, triggering a crisis from 20 October until its termination on 25 November 1971 (see Case #245). On 17 September 1972 1,000 supporters of ex-President Obote in Tanzania invaded Uganda from Tanzania; no Tanzanian soldiers were among them. Idi Amin responded the following day by moving forces to the border region to meet the invasion and by bombing the town of Bukoba in Tanzania, triggering a crisis for Tanzania. Tanzania responded the same day by moving its Fourth Battalion of over 1,000 men to the border. Its crisis management technique was mediation, both through the OAU and Somalia.  By 24 September the Somali delegation, under the leadership of President Siad Barre, had developed a peace plan that both states found favorable. The termination date for both actors was 5 October 1972, when they signed the Mogadishu Agreement wherein both announced their intention to remove forces from the border area and to cease all military hostilities. Moreover, the two sides agreed to stop all hostile propaganda against each other and "to refrain from harboring or allowing subversive forces to operate in the territory of one state against the other." Somalia led a military observer mission to ensure compliance.  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
A major battle between (North) Yemen and South Yemen triggered a crisis for the two states from 26 September to 28 November 1972. The U.K.'s withdrawal from Aden (South Yemen) in August 1967 led to the creation of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (hereafter, the PDRY or South Yemen). Relations between the two Yemens deteriorated in 1971 as the PDRY adopted a more radical pro-Soviet policy while the YAR established increasingly friendly relations with Sa'udi Arabia. The situation in the YAR was further complicated by rivalry between the traditionalist Fadi tribes of the northern provinces and the more progressive people of the southern provinces who looked for support to South Yemen. Irregular forces operating from Sa'udi Arabia made a series of unsuccessful raids into South Yemen between October 1970 and June 1971. A series of clashes on the border of the two Yemeni states occurred between February and May 1972. The USSR provided military aid and advisors to both sides. Each country accused the other of troop buildups along the border. During the summer of 1972 the long-standing border dispute resulted in a series of armed clashes. A major battle on 26 September 1972 over the border town of Qa'taba spread over a 45-75 mile front and triggered a crisis for both North and South Yemen. Fighting continued until 13 October when a cease-fire was concluded by an Arab League mission that was to provide military observers to monitor the cessation of hostilities. Nevertheless, fighting continued until 19 October when a new cease-fire agreement was reached.  A peace agreement and an agreement on unification were initialed in Cairo on 28 October by representatives of the two Yemens. Their presidents signed an agreement on unification on 28 November 1972 in Tripoli, Libya, terminating the crisis for both Yemens. Air services were resumed between North and South Yemen two days later.  Colonel Qaddhafi of Libya had an active part in mediating the discussions, and it was reported that he had threatened to imprison the leaders of both countries until they signed a unification agreement and then agreed to give them $46 million per year if they did so. There was Kuwaiti mediation as well, which occurred prior to the onset of crisis, and the Arab League persuaded the two sides to agree to the cease-fire on 13 October. Finally, President Boumediene of Algeria met with the leaders of both countries in late October to discuss unification.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
This intrawar crisis for South Vietnam, the United States, and North Vietnam began on 23 October 1972 and ended on 27 January 1973. The peace talks at Paris broke down once more; and, when a deadlock could no longer be avoided, it was followed by an escalation in hostilities on the battlefield. The crisis trigger for South Vietnam occurred on 23 October 1972 when it learned of agreements reached between the delegates of the United States and North Vietnam at the Paris talks. The response, the next day, was a public refusal to comply with these agreements. Fighting in Vietnam and negotiations in Paris were carried on simultaneously. But on 4 December 1972 North Vietnam rejected all U.S. proposals and withdrew its acceptance of early changes already agreed upon while making new demands. This triggered a crisis for the U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger surmised that North Vietnam was now willing to risk a break in the talks. When additional meetings on 6, 11, and 13 December ended in stalemate, the U.S. concluded that Hanoi had in effect made a strategic decision to prolong the war, abort all negotiations, and seek an unconditional victory.  On 14 December the U.S. responded with an order by Nixon to renew the aerial bombing of the Hanoi-Haiphong military complex and the mining of North Vietnamese ports. Massive bombing began on 17 December and triggered a crisis for North Vietnam. It responded on the 26th by signaling a willingness to return to serious negotiations without preconditions. On the 26th the U.S. bombed the Hanoi railway station, killing 283 people and wounding 266. North Vietnam proposed 8 January 1973 for meetings in Paris. The crisis ended for all three actors on 27 January, with the formal signing of the Peace Accords in Paris.  As with so many crises during this protracted conflict, the USSR was marginally involved--politically. Neither the UN nor SEATO was involved in this crisis.
Zambia experienced another crisis with Rhodesia from 19 January to 3 February 1973. On 9 January 1973 the Rhodesian government closed the border with Zambia except for copper exports, which constitute 90 percent of all exports from Zambia. Rhodesia's Prime Minister Ian Smith accused Zambia of harboring terrorists who were allegedly responsible for incidents threatening Rhodesian citizens. Preceding and immediately following the closure there had been several border incidents between the two countries. On 19 January 1973, the government of Zambia perceived that Rhodesia might use an incident in which Zambian troops and police fired on a threatening South African police motorboat on the Zambezi River as an excuse to launch a military attack on Zambia. The same day, in response to this trigger, Defense Minister Grey Zulu declared that Zambian forces had been moved to the border. On 24 January Zambia requested an urgent session of the Security Council and accused Rhodesia, with South African aid, of violating Zambia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. On the 27th President Kaunda sent a letter to Secretary-General Waldheim stating that Zambia would not tolerate violations of its territory by Rhodesia or South Africa. The Security Council met on the 29th (at that time, Rhodesia and South Africa were the targets of UN economic sanctions; and South Africa's formal status at the UN had been reduced). The crisis ended on 3 February, when Rhodesia, satisfied that its objectives had been achieved, reopened the border with Zambia.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.  (On 10 March, after the termination of the crisis, the Security Council passed a resolution calling upon Britain to convene a conference to bring about self-determination and independence to Rhodesia and called upon Rhodesia's government to release all political prisoners.)
The appearance of a Libyan plane over Israeli-occupied territory created a 30-minute crisis for Israel on 21 February 1973. Several weeks prior to this event, Israel's cabinet had been alerted to a terrorist plot to hijack an airliner which would be packed with explosives and crashed into an Israeli population center. On 21 February 1973 a plane was spotted on Israeli radar heading in the direction of Israel's nuclear plant in Dimona. Apparently a Libyan Boeing-727 with 113 passengers on board had strayed over the eastern side of the Suez Canal, then occupied by Israel. Israeli fighter planes immediately intercepted the intruding aircraft, demanding identification. Twenty minutes of sustained warnings and signals to the pilot brought no results. Orders were requested from higher military officers. The Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General David Elazar, ordered the air force to shoot down the plane. Israeli pilots responded by so doing. When the plane crashed, 30 minutes after it had been spotted, the crisis for Israel was terminated.  Immediately thereafter the Israelis learned that the plane had been a civilian airliner from Libya and that it had not represented a security threat. There were very few survivors. Most of the passengers were Egyptian, some German. The pilot was French. Israel subsequently paid compensation to the families of the dead. Following the crisis Israel was condemned by most members of the international system. France conducted a separate investigation. There was no UN or superpower activity during the crisis because of its brevity.
A crisis for Kuwait began on 20 March and ended on 8 June 1973. By 1973 Iraq's pressure on Kuwait to make territorial concessions that would enable an Iraqi creation of a new base for petroleum and military operations in the Persian Gulf had increased. A year earlier Kuwait had refused a large loan to Iraq. The USSR supported Iraqi claims to two Kuwaiti islands, Bubiyan and Warba, as it was expected that Iraq would permit the USSR to establish a naval facility there. Soviet support of Iraq was perceived by Kuwait, Iran, and other Western-aligned states in the Middle East as threatening. And Kuwait's growing rapprochement with Iran and Sa'udi Arabia disturbed Iraqi decision makers. On 20 March 1973 Iraqi troops crossed the border into Kuwait, with a view to annexing part of the disputed territory along their 99-mile border. Kuwait immediately sent troops, but they were defeated by the superior Iraqi forces, who then occupied the Kuwaiti outpost of Sametah where a number of huts were established. When Kuwait surrounded these huts with mosques the Iraqi forces were contained. The next day, at an emergency session of the Kuwaiti cabinet and parliament, a decision was taken to negotiate rather than fight.  On 21 March, Arab League Secretary-General Riad began mediation efforts to reduce hostilities in the crisis. Kuwait's insistence on Iraq's withdrawal, and the latter's refusal to do so, brought Riad’s efforts to a standstill. On 6 April the two foreign ministers met, after which Iraqi forces were withdrawn and an announcement was made by both parties that they accepted the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader, Yasser Arafat, as mediator. The debate centered around Kuwait's refusal to concede or to lease the islands to Iraq. The following day Kuwait offered a substantial investment in Iraqi development projects and special treatment for Iraqis residing in Kuwait.  The crisis ended on 8 June 1973 when an agreement was reached between the two states that included an Iraqi increase of freshwater supplies to Kuwait from the Shatt-al-Arab, but there were no Kuwaiti concessions on the islands. Following the agreement both Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia completed substantial arms deals with the U.S. and the U.K., respectively, while Iraq obtained increased arms supplies from the USSR.  Mediation attempts were made by Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria, but these were secondary to the role of Arafat; and Iran and Sa'udi Arabia offered military support to Kuwait. There were reports of 15,000 Sa'udi troops in Kuwait shortly after the beginning of the crisis.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
A crisis for Israel in its relations with Egypt began on 10 April 1973 and ended in late June of that year. After the Arab defeat in the 1967 War (see Case #222), the Egyptians began to rebuild their armed forces, in conjunction with efforts to find a diplomatic solution to Arab (mainly Egypt's and Syria's) dissatisfaction over Israeli control of the Sinai Desert, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Anwar al-Sadat succeeded Nasir as President of Egypt in 1970 and persuaded Moscow to resupply weapons on a large scale. In early 1973 newly appointed Egyptian Chief of Staff Ahmed Ismail visited Moscow and conducted negotiations for additional Soviet arms. His visit to Washington, however, was less successful. In February President Nixon emphasized that the United States had no intention of putting pressure on Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula and all other territories captured during the Six Day War. Shortly thereafter news of U.S. agreement to supply Israel with 48 Phantoms and 36 Skyhawks was leaked to the press. Egyptian coordination with the Syrians began in February 1973, and a joint attack was scheduled for May of that year. At the beginning of April Sadat stated publicly that Egypt was preparing for war with Israel. He also announced a large Egyptian army exercise. On 10 April 1973 Israel's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General David Elazar, received intelligence reports of an intended Egyptian attack slated for 15 May: further, that Iraq and Libya had each sent 16 fighter planes to Egypt. Israeli intelligence maintained, however, that Sadat would back down before the actual launching of the war. This estimate was not accepted by Elazar. Israel responded by placing its army on alert on 13 April and by canceling all leaves. War preparations began, and reserve units were called into active service.  Toward the end of June, after the Nixon-Brezhnev talks on the 22nd, Israel became convinced that Egypt did not intend to go to war at that time, and the crisis came to an end. Sadat subsequently explained that the postponement of the war was due to a scheduling of a second summit conference in Washington for May. Elazar came under severe criticism by Israel's finance minister for the economic cost of the April mobilization, while the Israel intelligence estimates were vindicated. This proved to be a crucial factor in Elazar's reluctance to order general mobilization and misconceptions that characterized Israeli thinking just before the successful Egyptian attack on 6 October 1973 (see Case #255).  There was no superpower or UN involvement in this crisis.
The first crisis between the U.K. and Iceland over cod fishing rights began on 14 May and ended on 13 November 1973. In 1972 a dispute between Iceland, on the one hand, and Britain and West Germany, on the other, centered around Iceland's unilateral extension of its territorial waters from a 12-mile limit to 50 miles. This severely curtailed the fish catch available to other countries. Several incidents occurred as a result of the harassment of British and West German trawlers by Icelandic gunboats. Further incidents of ramming and exchanges of fire were reported in March and April 1973. On the night of 14 May 1973 Icelandic gunboats fired on British trawlers, triggering a crisis for the U.K. On the 16th British fishers threatened to leave the disputed waters if protection were not assured. London responded on 19 May by dispatching Royal Navy ships to Icelandic waters, triggering a crisis for Iceland. The following day, Iceland banned RAF aircraft from landing at the Keflavik NATO base, while protesting to the U.K. Talks between the two prime ministers began on 2 October. On 13 November 1973 the parliament of Iceland approved an agreement whereby Iceland set aside certain areas within the newly accepted 50-mile limit for British fishers, terminating the crisis for both actors.  Two regional/security organizations, NATO and the Council of Europe, were involved, but neither was effective in abating the crisis. The U.S. limited its involvement to a statement about the dispute. A proposal for mediation came from Norway. USSR involvement was more substantial, however. Continued NATO use of the Keflavik air base, which was necessary for the implementation of important NATO antisubmarine warfare operations, was already an issue in Icelandic politics. Iceland's request to the USSR for a show of force during the crisis was answered by a special Soviet naval exercise: 10 Russian ships and 10 submarines were dispatched as a signal to the U.K. There was also a reported request from Iceland to the Soviet Union for a gunboat to strengthen Iceland's coast guard.  A second Cod War crisis occurred between Iceland and the U.K. in 1975-76 (see Case #263).  The UN was not involved in this case.
The October-Yom Kippur crisis began on 5 October 1973 and ended on 31 May 1974. The crisis actors were Israel, Syria, the United States, Egypt, and the Soviet Union. The West Bank of the Jordan River, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the entire Sinai Peninsula had been occupied by Israel since the Six Day War of June 1967 (see Case #222). In March 1969 Egypt launched a War of Attrition against Israeli forces in the Sinai. In August 1970 a cease-fire was accepted by both sides with plans to put into effect a U.S. plan for peace in the region (see Case #232). The plan was never implemented. In April 1973 Israeli forces were put on alert, including a large mobilization, when its leaders suspected Egyptian mobilization and war exercises to be a prelude to an invasion of Israel (see Case #253). The invasion never took place.  On 13 September 1973 Israel and Syria fought an air battle in which 13 Syrian MIGs and one Israeli Mirage were shot down. When Syria did not react immediately to this dramatic defeat, Israel became suspicious that Damascus was planning a more basic action. Israeli forces in the north were strengthened, and precautionary measures were also taken in the south. Syria's massing of three infantry divisions, tanks, and artillery, and a mobilization of Syrian reserves in the north, along with the evacuation of Soviet military advisors and their families from Damascus and Cairo, were all noted by Israeli intelligence. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was put on the highest state of alert. Nevertheless, Israeli intelligence, as late as 3 October 1973, perceived the outbreak of war to be very unlikely. This erroneous judgment was based upon two Israeli misperceptions: that Egypt's inferior air power would not permit it to launch a war against Israel, and that Syria would not "go it alone," without Egyptian active participation. On 5 October 1973 a movement of Egyptian forces toward the Suez Canal and a change from a defensive to an offensive posture triggered a crisis for Israel. At the same time, Israel's intelligence service belatedly reported an impending Egyptian attack across the Canal scheduled for the following day. Israel immediately raised the IDF alert level and strengthened its forces along the northern and southern borders. The war began on 6 October with a simultaneous attack by Egyptian and Syrian forces. Egypt's successful crossing of the Suez Canal on the 7th and Syria's advance on the Golan Heights catalyzed an Israeli intra-war crisis (IWC): perceiving a grave danger, it adopted the "Samson Option," the use of Israeli nuclear weapons to stem the Egyptian/Syrian resort to counterattacks on the coastal plain. A few days later, on 14 October 1973, Israel's nuclear weapons were returned to storage. By 10 October, after heavy losses, Israeli forces succeeded in reversing the tide of battle in the north, triggering a crisis for Syria. Syria's response was multiple: it stepped up resistance, called upon Egypt to increase military pressure on Israel in the south, and appealed to the Soviet Union for aid. During the next three days Israeli forces advanced 10 kilometers beyond the 1967 cease-fire lines into Syrian territory.  On 12 October Israeli Prime Minister Meir agreed to a cease-fire in place. Its rejection by Egypt and Syria triggered a crisis for the United States, which feared a possible confrontation with the USSR. All seven Soviet airborne divisions had been placed on an increased state of readiness. The heavy Soviet commitment to the Arabs, in the form of resupplying arms by air and sea, indicated to Washington that Moscow would not tolerate a humiliating Arab defeat comparable to that in 1967.  The successful Egyptian operation to cross the Suez Canal was followed on 14 October by a large-scale tank battle in which Egypt suffered a severe defeat. On the 16th the Israelis crossed the Canal, threatening to surround the Egyptian Third Army. A crisis for Egypt was triggered on the 18th when Sadat became aware of the worsening position. Egypt's response was to pressure the Soviet Union to obtain a cease-fire agreement, which was accepted by Israel and Egypt on 22 October. When the Egyptians continued their attempt to destroy Israeli tank concentrations in order to open up an escape route for the Third Army, fighting broke out once more, with Israel strengthening its positions on the Egyptian side of the Canal.  Israeli violations of the 22 October cease-fire agreement triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. Moscow responded on the 24th with a movement of naval vessels and a Note from President Brezhnev to President Nixon containing a clear warning that, unless the Israeli onslaught on the west bank of the Suez Canal was stopped at once, the USSR might intervene unilaterally. The U.S. responded with mounting pressure on Israel to stop fighting and to allow nonmilitary supplies to reach the Third Army. At the same time, Nixon issued a sharp reply to Moscow: most of the U.S. armed forces, including the Strategic Air Command with its nuclear capability, were put on a high state of alert, namely "Defensive Condition 3."  The crisis escalated further when, on 25 October, a Soviet freighter arrived in Alexandria reportedly carrying nuclear weapons. Finally, on 26 October 1973, a U.S.-Soviet-sponsored Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire was accepted by all the parties.  Talks between Egypt and Israel, with the active participation of U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger, continued for two months and concentrated on withdrawal to the post-Six Day War lines, the problem of the encircled Third Army, and the exchange of prisoners. A one-day symbolic Geneva Conference was convened on 21 December. Israel agreed to withdraw to 20 kilometers from the Canal and the size of both forces was reduced. A Disengagement Agreement was signed on 18 January 1974, ending the crisis for Egypt.  The negotiations between Israel and Syria took much longer. Kissinger mediated once more. Israel's demand for a complete list of all Israeli prisoners of war was negotiated by Kissinger in February 1974. In March Syria announced that it had decided to resume the war immediately. Shelling of Israeli-held positions in the north and firing back and forth continued throughout the spring of 1974. On 2 May the U.S. secretary of state began a month of shuttle diplomacy, traveling between Damascus and Jerusalem, with side trips to Riyad, Amman, and Cairo.  In the final agreement Israel returned parts of the Syrian town of Quneitra but kept control over two of the three strategic hills in the area where heavy weapons were forbidden. A UN buffer zone was established. The Israeli demand that Syria commit itself to a cessation of all terrorist activities was refused. As in the case of the Israel-Egypt Agreement, a U.S. Memorandum of Understanding was given to Israel. The Agreement was announced on 29 May and was signed on 31 May 1974, terminating the crisis for Israel, Syria, the Soviet Union, and the United States.  The superpowers, as crisis actors, were involved at a high level. Each supplied massive arms and equipment, as well as political support, to its client state. The cease-fire agreements were worked out between their representatives. Premier Kosygin arrived in Cairo on 16 October to persuade Egypt to accept a cease-fire. Kissinger visited Moscow on 19-20 October and hammered out a draft resolution for the Security Council, calling for an immediate cease-fire. The Council adopted this resolution within hours and authorized the creation of a UN force to police the Golan Heights.
South Yemen's active military assistance to Omani rebels created a crisis for Oman from 18 November 1973 to 11 March 1976. Fighting in Oman's eastern province of Dhofar between rebels and the sultan's army began in 1963. After independence in 1967 South Yemen increased support to the rebels. By 1970 the insurgents' control extended to all of Dhofar. The traditional sultan was deposed by his son in July 1970. This was followed by a lull in the fighting, and the more liberal sultan was able to gain some tribal support. After the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf in 1971, the area was characterized by a power vacuum. Oman's independence was proclaimed at the end of 1971. In 1972 the Omani forces, strengthened by British, Iranian, and Jordanian troops, along with financial aid and arms from Sa'udi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, succeeded in turning the campaign in their favor.  The focal point of tension between Oman and South Yemen had been the latter's support to the insurgents, along with Iraq, both in training (with arms supplied by the People's Republic of China) and in active participation in fighting. Rights over the Kuria Muria Islands, located off the Dhofar coast, were also in dispute. Clashes occurred on the Oman/South Yemen border in 1972, mainly as a result of an incursion into Dhofar by left-wing guerrillas operating from South Yemen. On 15 April 1973 Iran sent additional forces to Oman. On 18 November 1973 the Oman government announced that a military post had been attacked by South Yemen aircraft and that South Yemen forces were actively engaged in the fighting in Dhofar. Oman's response, on 22 December, was a successful military campaign to free the Muscat-Salala road held by the rebels. Oman's growing economic strength had enabled it to purchase large quantities of military equipment and to expand the army. On 28 January 1975 it was reported that guerrilla supply lines from South Yemen had been blocked. The rebels were completely cut off from supplies by October. And by the end of 1975 the insurgents had been driven out of their last strongholds in Dhofar and had crossed into South Yemen. cease-fire  South Yemen and Oman signed a cease-fire on 11 March 1976, under the auspices of Sa’udi mediation. Kuwait had attempted to mediate and drew up a plan that eventually came to fruition under Sa’udi Arabia’s leadership. The plan was for Sa’udi Arabia to pay South Yemen’s bankrupt government $400 million over five years in exchange for a halt to South Yemen’s assistance to the rebels in Oman. This resulted in a South Yemeni and Sa’udi statement of mutual friendship on 10 March and the cease-fire with Oman on the following day.  In May 1974 the League of Arab States (LAS) had created a conciliation commission that attempted to mediate, but without success. An LAS proposal for an international force to replace the non-Arab troops was refused by the sultan, who was willing to welcome it only if the Arab force consented to fight alongside the existing forces.  Oman received military assistance from the U.S. As South Yemen's relations with the Soviet bloc improved, the USSR increased arms supplies to the rebels.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
This crisis lasted from 15 July 1974 until 24 February 1975. As in earlier crises over Cyprus, there were three actors: Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece. The 1960 agreement among Greece, Turkey, and the U.K. for the maintenance of the status quo in Cyprus was undermined once more when a terrorist group, EOKA-B, advocating enosis (union with Greece), planned a coup against President Makarios. On 2 July 1974 in a letter to the Greek government, the president accused Greek officers in the Cypriot National Guard of plotting his assassination and demanded their removal. New policies were introduced by Cyprus to reduce their influence. On 15 July 1974 a military coup was engineered in Nicosia by officers from Athens, and parliamentary rule was overthrown, triggering a crisis for Cyprus. Makarios escaped to London, and Nikos Sampson was installed as President. Heavy fighting followed. The Cypriot response, on the 19th, was an appeal to the UN Security Council and to the U.K. for assistance. The 15 July coup also triggered a crisis for Turkey, which then proceeded to mount a counterpolice action, after the military junta in Greece rejected its demand to restore Makarios as President of Cyprus. Immediately after the coup, British and U.S. diplomats began mediation intended to lead to a cease-fire. Britain, one of three guarantor powers to Cyprus, was the lead mediator, and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger assisted.  On 20 July, after rejecting pleas from the U.S., the U.K., and the UN for restraint, Turkey invaded Cyprus. Soon 40,000 Turkish troops were in control of the territory stretching from Kyrenia on the north coast to Nicosia. Fighting was extensive, and there were thousands of casualties. A crisis was triggered for Greece with the invasion on 20 July.  The superiority of the Turkish forces and the distance between Greece and Cyprus prevented a Greek counterattack: and the disastrous failure of the Greek military junta's attempt to precipitate enosis toppled the regime in Greece. On 23 July a civilian government was restored in Athens. Sampson resigned as President of Cyprus, and Glafkos Clerides was installed as Acting President.  Peace negotiations opened on 25 July attended by representatives from the U.K., Greece, and Turkey and an observer from the USSR. An agreement was signed on 30 July confirming a cease-fire and establishing a security zone between the Greek and Turkish forces. Talks, however, broke down on 4 August, and Turkish forces advanced to occupy the entire northern part of Cyprus, over 40 percent of the island's territory. Human rights violations against the Greek population were reported. Once Turkey had achieved its military objectives, it called for a cease-fire on 16 August, which went into effect immediately. Following a series of talks between Archbishop Makarios and Clerides during November, Makarios returned to Cyprus on 7 December 1974. In February 1975 a Turkish-Cypriot Federated State was proclaimed and, on 24 February, a Constituent Assembly for Turkish Cyprus was convened, ending the crisis for Turkey. By their failure to challenge this act, the crisis ended for Cyprus and Greece as well.  The UN played an active role in the third international crisis over Cyprus. An emergency meeting of the Security Council was held immediately after the coup on 15 July. Several resolutions were passed, calling for a cease-fire, an end to foreign military intervention in Cyprus and respect for its sovereignty, and the resumption of negotiations, as well as cooperation of the parties with UN forces. The abortive cease-fire agreements of 22 and 30 July were to come into effect under UN auspices. The UN Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) supervised the cease-fire of 16 August. Talks between Acting President Clerides and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Denktash, were also held under UN auspices. On 13 December the UNFICYP mandate was extended for another six-month period.  The U.S., beset by the Watergate political crisis at home, was nevertheless active in efforts to mediate among the parties. Cyprus and Greece maintained that the absence of U.S. pressure on Turkey to stop military action encouraged Ankara. And when U.S. military aid to Turkey was stopped in December, relations between those two countries deteriorated. NATO was not active in the crisis. Greece, protesting that security organization's inability to restrain Turkey, withdrew its forces from NATO.  The Soviet Union made several military moves during the crisis. A Soviet task force moving toward Cyprus was reinforced at sea; and seven airborne divisions were put on alert. More than two decades later, the partition of Cyprus remained intact.
The final crisis for South Vietnam and Cambodia during the long war in Indochina occurred from 14 December 1974 to 30 April 1975. Civil wars in Cambodia and Vietnam persisted after the United States formally withdrew its forces in 1973. The U.S. continued to supply economic and military aid to the governments of both Cambodia and South Vietnam. Some U.S. advisors stayed in the area. By the end of 1974 forces of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and the Vietcong and North Vietnamese army in South Vietnam had increased their activities in preparation for a final offensive. The trigger for South Vietnam occurred on 14 December 1974, with the beginning of the North Vietnam offensive. For Cambodia, the crisis was triggered on 1 January 1975 with the launching of a major Khmer Rouge offensive. Several areas in Cambodia were lost and recaptured as fighting raged between the two sides. On 17 February Cambodia responded with a counteroffensive. The South Vietnamese response was a combination of continued fighting, a request to the U.S. for aid, and a tactical retreat instigated by President Thieu on 11 March. On 17 April the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, fell to the rebels, forcing the government to flee and marking the end of Cambodia's last crisis in the Vietnam War. Meanwhile, North Vietnamese troops pressed on with their offensive as the South Vietnam army retreated toward Saigon. Thousands of refugees fled before the advancing troops, clogging the roads and filling the ports and airports. Saigon fell on 30 April, ending the crisis--and independent existence--for South Vietnam.  U.S. involvement took the form of aid to both governments. Despite special appeals to Congress on 28 January by President Ford and, subsequently, by Secretary of State Kissinger, Congress decided to cut aid to both Cambodia and South Vietnam. Assistance was given to Vietnamese refugees; and by the end of the crisis U.S. activity was limited to evacuating U.S. citizens. UN involvement was confined to calls for a cease-fire and the fact-finding activities of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
The Mayaguez episode was a crisis for the United States and Cambodia from 12 to 15 May 1975. America's prestige was at a low point in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Indochina and the collapse of U.S.-supported regimes in Cambodia and Vietnam. In Cambodia the Khmer Rouge had emerged victorious from the civil war. While U.S. relations with China had improved considerably since 1971, relations with the new government of Cambodia were hostile. On 12 May 1975 a U.S.-registered cargo ship, the Mayaguez, was seized off Cambodian coastal waters by the Khmer Rouge, triggering a crisis for the United States. The ship was taken into custody, together with its crew, with no word of their fate. Washington looked upon this incident as a challenge to U.S. influence in Southeast Asia. Following demands for the return of the ship and crew, on the 12th, the U.S. threat, on 13 May, to use force if necessary triggered a crisis for Cambodia.  The U.S. decision to use military force was taken on the 14th by President Ford at the fourth and final meeting of the National Security Council on this issue. Cambodia's response, also on the 14th, was a statement accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs and threatening reprisals. A few minutes after fighting began, the Cambodians released the ship and crew, ending the crisis for the United States. Nevertheless, even after Cambodia's acquiescence, serious clashes took place between Khmer Rouge forces and U.S. marines in the vicinity of Koh Tong, an island thought to be in the area where the Mayaguez crew was being held. The U.S. employed massive force, and heavy casualties were reported on both sides.  The crisis for Cambodia ended on 15 May when the U.S. ceased its military operations. UN involvement was minimal: the Secretary-General offered his good offices to settle the dispute, but this had little effect. In addition to the two crisis actors, the PRC became involved when Cambodia requested Beijing to conduct limited negotiations on its behalf. The USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
Zaire, Zambia, South Africa, Angola, Cuba, the Soviet Union, and the United States were direct participants in a crisis from 12 July 1975 until 27 March 1976. The Alvor Agreement, signed on 15 January 1975, formally granted independence to Angola, to take effect on 10 November 1975 after elections in October. A transitional government was to be composed of representatives of the following: the FNLA (the National Front for the Liberation of Angola), formed in 1957, supported by the U.S. and Zaire, with its power base in the Bakongo tribe of northern Angola; the marxist-oriented MPLA, supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba and popular in Angola's coastal urban areas, among intellectuals of the north-central Kimbundu tribe; and UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), formed in the mid-1960s, in a split from the FNLA--it had a strong popular base among the Ovimbundu tribe in the south and central rural areas and received support from South Africa and Zambia. There was to be a unified security force under a Portuguese high commissioner. The Alvor Agreement broke down as early as March 1975, with major fighting between the FNLA and the MPLA erupting in late April. Portugal declared martial law on 15 May. President Kenyatta of Kenya mediated a cease-fire on 21 June, but it was broken almost immediately. On 12 July 1975 Soviet-backed MPLA forces attacked the FNLA headquarters in the capital, Luanda, triggering a crisis for Zaire and Zambia when the essential Benguela railroad was closed down. Zaire began sending small-scale commando units into Angola in mid-July to assist the FNLA. By that time the Soviet Union had started providing massive aid to the MPLA, causing alarm in Zaire, Zambia, and South Africa, as well as in the United States, which had been providing covert aid to both the FNLA and the UNITA movements.  Zambia responded on 27 July with an appeal to the U.S. for aid. Hydroelectric power projects, built jointly by South Africa and Portugal, were located on the Kunene River bordering South-West Africa (later Namibia). Clashes between UNITA and MPLA forces began approaching the power projects on 8 August, triggering a crisis for South Africa, which sent small units of troops to the projects on the 11th and 12th. On the 15th the FNLA captured the major port of Lobito, triggering a crisis for the MPLA (Angola), Cuba, and the Soviet Union. Cuba and the USSR were concerned that South African intervention would result in the defeat of the MPLA in the struggle for power and influence in Angola. Cuba's response, on 20 August, was a decision to increase military aid to the MPLA (which was later to be recognized as the government of Angola). More South African troops were sent to the district capital on 21-22 August. On the 21st UNITA declared war on the MPLA, after concluding an alliance with the FNLA. On the 31st the USSR, too, increased its aid to Angola.  On 1 September the MPLA (Angola) responded with a major offensive that succeeded in reversing its losses, triggering a crisis for the United States. Cuban troops began to arrive on the 3rd. On 11 September Zaire sent two full battalions to strengthen the FNLA. President Mobutu approached the U.S. for aid and initiated diplomatic activity with other African states. The U.S. responded on 25 September with an increase of covert aid to Zaire, to be funneled to UNITA and the FNLA. President Ford requested that Congress increase emergency aid to Zaire.  South Africa's response to the escalating crisis was the dispatch of a strike force into Angola on 23 October 1975 to aid the FNLA/UNITA alliance. It was successful in recouping earlier losses. A further escalation for Zaire, Zambia, the U.S., and South Africa was catalyzed by the arrival of a large number of Cuban troops to fight alongside the MPLA, together with massive arms supplies to Angola from the Soviet Union. On 10 November the remaining Portuguese personnel were withdrawn from Angola. Both the MPLA and the FNLA/UNITA declared the independence of Angola. The former was recognized by the USSR, Soviet-bloc members, including Cuba, and some African states. The latter was never officially recognized.  The U.S. crisis ended on 19 December 1975, when Congress refused to grant aid to Zaire or to support the FNLA/UNITA. An earlier appeal by Secretary of State Kissinger to the NATO Foreign Ministers' Council for support to the FNLA/UNITA was also rejected. The crisis for Zambia ended after a MPLA victory had become more apparent: on 18 February 1976 Zambia announced that it would recognize the state of Angola but not the MPLA government. This was done on 22 February, after negotiations. The crisis for Angola, Cuba, and the USSR ended on 24 February after UNITA announced, on the 12th, its decision to retreat and revert to guerrilla warfare, followed by a similar FNLA announcement on the 24th. On 28 February Zaire announced its decision to recognize the Angola government, after talks between Mobutu and the MPLA head, Neto. South Africa, after extensive negotiations via British Foreign Secretary Callaghan and the Soviet ambassador to London, achieved MPLA guarantees for the security of the hydroelectric projects and the safety of the personnel there. On 27 March South Africa announced a complete troop withdrawal from Angola.  There was intense foreign involvement in the Angolan War. Cuba, the Soviet Union, Congo (Brazzaville), and Yugoslavia actively supported the MPLA, with Cuban forces directly engaged in combat. The United States, China, North Korea, and Zaire aided the FNLA; Zaire, in addition to extensive diplomatic activity, provided military bases on its territory. Zambia supported UNITA diplomatically. And Tanzania provided diplomatic support and port facilities for the unloading of Soviet arms for the MPLA. There was also diplomatic activity by the Ivory Coast, Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria.  The OAU used several procedures in an attempt to settle the conflict; all were unsuccessful. In January 1975 it supported the Alvor Accords. In July it called for a cease-fire and a National Unity Government for Angola. On 28 July, Idi Amin of Uganda was sworn in as the new Secretary-General of the OAU and immediately took on the duties of mediating the ongoing situation in Angola, submitting a proposal for a government of national unity between the MPLA, FNLA and UNITA. OAU conciliation commissions were sent to the area in July and October 1975. On 10-13 January 1976 the OAU held an emergency summit meeting on Angola that Amin had requested; it broke down on the 13th with members divided evenly on whether to recognize the PRA or call for a government of national unity. By 2 February 1976 a majority of OAU members had recognized the MPLA government, automatically extending OAU recognition. Angola was admitted to the OAU on 10 February. By 22 February 70 states, including members of the European Economic Community (EEC) (later the European Community [EC] and, since 1992, the European Union [EU]), had granted recognition.  The UN was less active. The good offices of Secretary-General Waldheim were used to relay MPLA guarantees to South Africa. The UN sent an inquiry and conciliation mission to Angola on 14 October 1975. On 10 March 1976 Kenya requested an emergency Security Council session on South Africa's "act of aggression." The Council met from 26 to 31 March; and, despite South Africa's claim that its troops had already left Angola, a resolution was passed condemning South Africa and demanding that it respect the territorial integrity of Angola, as well as that it cease the use of Pretoria-controlled South-West Africa (later, Namibia) for military incursions.  Washington had been supplying aid covertly to the FNLA since the Kennedy administration. In January 1975 an interagency National Security Task Force on Angola was formed. In December the State Department instructed the Gulf Oil Company to suspend the payment of $125 million in royalties to the MPLA-controlled Angolan finance ministry. During the Angola crisis there were widespread strikes and unemployment in the United States in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate. These legacies prompted Congress to decide to withdraw aid to Zaire, thereby extricating the U.S. from a major crisis in southern Africa.  Angola was viewed by both the Soviet Union and Africans as a watershed in American attitudes toward U.S. military intervention in the Third World. The initial Soviet position on Angola was to favor the right of all three rival Angolan movements to participate in the transitional government, but that posture changed early in 1975. Sino/Soviet rivalry was a major factor in Moscow's approach to the Angolan conflict. Soviet MIG-21s, tanks, and missiles were airlifted into Angola for the MPLA, and Soviet naval movements took place outside Angolan waters. With Cuban military assistance, Moscow was able to help its local ally, the MPLA, to establish itself as Angola's legitimate government.  (The FNLA and UNITA factions remained in control of large parts of Angola's territory--by 1979 UNITA controlled much of the southern third of Angola--and continued to pose a military challenge to MPLA and Cuban troops. The FNLA ceased to function as a separate force, but the civil war continued for 20 years. There were several abortive or short-lived cease-fire agreements and a comprehensive UN-brokered peace agreement between the MPLA-dominated government and UNITA in November 1994. However, a stable peace in Angola remains elusive.)
Spain and Morocco, and later, Algeria and Mauritania were the direct participants in a two-stage crisis over Western Sahara that lasted from 16 October 1975 to 14 April 1976. Morocco, interested in its rich phosphate mines, renewed a long-standing claim to Western Sahara in 1974. In August 1974 Spain proclaimed its internal autonomy as the first step toward decolonization. Morocco objected and called for Spain's immediate withdrawal, UN supervision, and the repatriation of some 20,000 refugees then in southern Morocco. In early October Morocco and Mauritania took the question of sovereignty over Western Sahara to the International Court of Justice (ICJ, World Court), through the UN Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories, to determine if Morocco or Mauritania had a legal claim to Western Sahara. Algeria, the most visible advocate of Western Sahara's independence, was concerned about Morocco's expansion, while Libya declared its willingness to fight Spain for the "liberation" of the disputed territory.  A secret agreement between Morocco and Mauritania to divide Western Sahara was reached on 1 October 1975, after a Spanish announcement that a referendum offering the people of that territory the choice between independence and association with Spain would be held during the first half of 1976. Morocco reaffirmed its categorical rejection of any referendum on independence for Western Sahara. On 15 October a UN mission reported sentiment for independence in Western Sahara. On the 16th the World Court ruled that, despite some historical links and legal ties, neither Morocco nor Mauritania had a valid claim to sovereignty over Western Sahara. The same day King Hassan of Morocco declared that he interpreted the ICJ's reference to Saharan "links" to Morocco as validating Moroccan claims to sovereignty over the area and that he intended to lead a march of 350,000 civilians into Western Sahara to hasten its integration into his kingdom. This triggered a crisis for Spain. Fearing a military clash it attempted to stop the proposed march by appealing to the UN Security Council. It also noted that force would be used only against an armed invasion. On 28 October Spain imposed emergency measures in order to prevent hostilities.  An announcement by Spain and Algeria on 2 November that the march would be countered by force triggered a crisis for Morocco. The same day Spain's Acting Head of State, Prince (later, King) Juan Carlos, flew to Sahara. He returned to Spain the next day to hold talks with the Moroccan prime minister. A Moroccan minister was sent to Algeria; and 20,000 Moroccan troops were moved to the Western Sahara border.  Spain's major response to the crisis was to withdraw its forces eight miles from the border on 5 November. The march began on the 6th but was halted by King Hassan on the 10th, a day after Spain agreed to exclude Algeria from negotiations over the future of Western Sahara. An agreement was signed on 14 November 1975 by Mauritania, Morocco, and Spain dividing Western Sahara between the two African claimants but leaving Spain a share in the valuable Bu Craa phosphate mines. It also provided for Spain's withdrawal from the territory on 28 February 1976. Until then Western Sahara was to be administered jointly by the three countries.  The 14 November agreement terminated Spain's crisis. It also generated a crisis for Algeria, where Polisario bases were located. Clashes between troops from Morocco and Mauritania, on the one hand, and Polisario guerrillas and regular Algerian troops, on the other, began in December.  A crisis for Mauritania was catalyzed by the first major Polisario offensive on 10 December 1975, allegedly aided by Cuban and North Vietnam "volunteers." Mauritania, surprised by the very strong resistance to its occupation of part of Western Sahara, confronted force with force.  A major Algerian attack on Moroccan forces on 27 January 1976 marked the beginning of the second stage of this crisis. Morocco responded with increased efforts to occupy more of the disputed territory. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara two days ahead of schedule, on 26 February. The following day Polisario declared the disputed territory's independence as the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. The SADR, called SAHRAWI, was recognized on 6 March by Algeria, marking the end of its crisis. Other African states and North Korea, too, granted recognition to SAHRAWI. Morocco and Mauritania responded by severing relations with Algeria on the 7th. And on the 14th they signed a convention fixing the borders of the disputed territory between them: Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara, Mauritania the other third. (Morocco annexed the rest of Western Sahara in 1980 when Mauritania renounced its claim.) This terminated the crisis for Morocco and Mauritania, and the Moroccan March crisis as a whole.  (Clashes continued to the end of April, particularly between Mauritanian and Polisario troops. New tensions were to break out once more in June [see Case #268--Nouakchott I].)  The UN played an active role in crisis management. The Security Council, responding to Spain's appeal, met on 20 October 1975 and passed a resolution on the 22nd calling for restraint by all parties. It also requested Secretary-General Waldheim to begin negotiations. Between 26 and 28 October Waldheim moderated between the sides and his envoy, André Lewin, followed-up immediately afterwards. The Council convened twice more, on 2 and 8 November. However, on the 8th, Morocco rejected the Waldheim Plan, which called for a six-month cooling-off period in which the UN would temporarily administer Western Sahara and send several hundred peacekeeping troops. Mediation was also attempted in March and April 1976 by the Secretary-General and his representative, Sweden's Ambassador to the UN, Olof Rydbeck; but the parties refused to compromise.  The United States supplied military aid to Morocco. A visit to the area by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa in early November contributed to the winding down of the first stage of the crisis--the 14 November 1975 agreement. Mediation was also attempted by Egypt and Libya. The OAU debated the issue from 26 February to 1 March 1976 and passed a compromise resolution that left to individual members the decision whether or not to recognize the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. The OAU also supported the Arab League's dispatch of its Secretary-General, Mahmoud Riad, to the area but without tangible effect. Evidence of covert Soviet aid to Algeria and Polisario came in the form of the shooting down of a Moroccan plane by a Soviet SAM-3 missile.  (Four years after this crisis, in July 1980, the SADR was admitted to OAU membership following recognition by 36 of the 49 member-states.)
The U.K. experienced a crisis from 1 to 30 November 1975 over Guatemala's threat to annex the British self-governing colony of Belize. Belize was proclaimed a U.K. colony (British Honduras), closely linked to Jamaica, in 1862. It became a separate administrative unit in 1884, with British troops stationed in the area since 1948. Guatemala formally claimed the territory after World War II. A brief incident, an attempted incursion by two dozen members of the Belize Liberation Army, occurred in 1962.  Guatemala's claim to Belize and threats to annex the disputed territory once it became independent were discussed at the UN General Assembly for about 10 years prior to this crisis. The U.K. retained responsibility for the defense of Belize, but, in all other aspects, the colony was self-governing. In 1972 Guatemala threatened to invade Belize but the incident faded without violence. On 1 November 1975 the U.K. perceived a likely invasion of Belize following increased Guatemalan military activity--a movement of troops and patrol boats near the Belize border. The U.K. responded on 5 November with the dispatch of additional forces to strengthen the British garrison in Belize. A declaration by Guatemala that it intended to annex Belize was reported on the 7th. Talks were held during a visit by Edward Rowlands, U.K. Minister of State at the foreign office, to Guatemala and Belize. An agreement was reached on 30 November terminating the crisis: the two countries were to resume talks about the future of Belize in February 1976. Troops were subsequently withdrawn on both sides.  The UN Trusteeship Council contributed to crisis abatement by adopting a resolution on 20 November urging the resumption of negotiations between the U.K. and Guatemala. An earlier offer of UN arbitration had been rejected by Guatemala.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (Two years later a second U.K. crisis occurred over Belize [see Case #279].)
Disputes over fishing rights in waters contiguous to Iceland precipitated another crisis for the U.K. and Iceland from 23 November 1975 to 1 June 1976. In November 1973 an agreement was reached between Iceland and the U.K. that set the former's territorial waters as 50 miles offshore, within which certain areas were set aside for British fishers (see Case #254). On 15 July 1975 the government of Iceland announced its intention to extend its territorial waters to 200 miles off the Icelandic coast, as of 15 October; further, all foreign vessels would be forbidden to fish inside the new limit. During November Icelandic gunboats harassed British trawlers fishing for cod within the 200-mile limit. On 23 November 1975 British trawler skippers warned the U.K. that they would withdraw from Iceland's 200-mile zone unless they were assured of Royal Navy protection. On the 25th the British government, convinced of the danger to the welfare and safety of the fishers, decided to dispatch frigates to Icelandic waters, triggering a crisis for Iceland. Iceland's foreign minister termed this U.K. move as "unmasked armed violence" and initiated talks between the two governments. The foreign ministers met in December 1975 and the prime ministers in January 1976. When these talks did not achieve progress, Iceland broke diplomatic relations with the U.K. on 18 February. Britain maintained the presence of the Royal Navy in Icelandic waters throughout the crisis, in order to protect the trawlers engaged in uninterrupted fishing. There were minor clashes. On 1 June 1976 an interim agreement between the two countries was signed in Oslo, allowing British trawlers fishing rights within the 200-mile zone, while limiting their number to an average of 24 trawlers a day.  The UN Security Council mediated the crisis from 2 to 11 December 1975; and talks between the two disputants were held under UN auspices. In addition, the UN was the first to suggest that economic issues of the crisis should be discussed. NATO and the Nordic Council discussed the military and economic issues of the crisis and met with the Icelandic and British leaders.  (A similar, though non-violent, incident over fishing rights between Canada and Spain, backed by the European Union, erupted in March 1995, with Canada's seizure of a Spanish trawler in the North Atlantic for alleged "illegal fishing.")
The disputed territory of East Timor generated a crisis for Indonesia from 28 November 1975 to 17 July 1976. The three most important political parties in Portuguese East Timor were Fretilin, which demanded immediate independence, UDT, which favored eventual independence with the continuation of ties to Portugal, and Apodeti, which wanted integration into Indonesia. After the Portuguese government announced in June 1975 its intention to relinquish control over all overseas territories, the UDT held high-level talks with Indonesian officials and announced, on 6 August 1975, that the party had decided to follow a political line acceptable to Indonesia. On 11 August the UDT carried out a coup in East Timor and demanded immediate independence from Portugal. Fighting between Fretilin and UDT factions broke out immediately. On 27 August the governor of East Timor admitted that the Portuguese authorities had lost control of the situation. The Portuguese administration then abandoned East Timor and retreated to the offshore island of Atauro. Portugal rejected Indonesia's offer to move in and restore order. As fighting intensified in September, an announcement was made by the defense ministry in Jakarta, on 9 September, that Indonesia would refuse to accept any Portuguese move to hand over East Timor to a government dominated by Fretilin, which at that time controlled a major part of the East Timor territory. This was followed by an announcement by the foreign minister that Indonesia had the right to intervene in East Timor if war endangered its territory. Border clashes increased in October and, on the 11th, Fretilin announced that a transitional administration had been established. The crisis trigger for Indonesia was the Fretilin declaration of East Timor's independence on 28 November 1975. Indonesia feared that an independent East Timor would encourage internal secessionist movements in Sumatra, West Irian, and the South Moluccas, as well as aid communist infiltration and influence in the area. On 29 November the pro-Indonesian political parties in East Timor declared it to be a part of Indonesia. That day, too, Portugal rejected all declarations of independence and, on 30 November, formally requested help from the UN to settle the problem. The major Indonesian response, on 7 December, was a large-scale invasion of East Timor. Portugal severed relations with Indonesia and requested a meeting of the Security Council. A second invasion was launched on 25 December, with heavy fighting between Fretilin and Indonesian forces continuing throughout December.  In March 1976 the East Timor Provisional Government announced its intention to integrate the island with Indonesia. This was followed by an Indonesian declaration that its troops would be withdrawn. The integration was approved by the East Timor People's Assembly on 31 May. On 17 July 1976 the crisis for Indonesia ended when President Suharto signed a bill formally incorporating East Timor into Indonesia. At that time the Indonesian forces had achieved control of the entire coastal area but not much of the interior.  The UN General Assembly passed a resolution on 12 December 1975 condemning Indonesian military intervention and calling for the withdrawal of Indonesian forces. The UN Security Council met five times between 15 and 22 December 1975. On the 22nd it passed a resolution calling on Indonesia to withdraw its forces from East Timor without delay and urged that a special representative of the Secretary-General be sent to assess the situation. This was done in late January 1976, but he was unable to establish contact with the Fretilin. On 22 April another resolution with the same content was adopted by the Security Council. None of these resolutions helped to abate the crisis.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
The civil war in Lebanon created a crisis for Syria from 18 January to 15 November 1976. The civil war in Lebanon began in April 1975: it was the culmination of years of gradual dislocation of Lebanese society, which developed into a polarization of the Christian and Muslim communities and signaled the possibility of the disintegration of Lebanon. Syria has always maintained that Lebanon and Syria are integral parts of Greater Syria and that the division of the two countries was artificially created by France to serve its colonial interests. Thus a possible partition of Lebanon was perceived by Syria as a threat to its vital security interests: first, as undermining Syria's image as the guardian of Arab nationalism and unity; and second, as giving Israel a pretext to move into southern Lebanon and occupy the area up to the Litani River. Syria's primary interest in 1975 was to mediate among the conflicting parties in Lebanon. Toward the end of that year victories by the Christian militias seemed to heighten the possibility of a partition of Lebanon. On 7 January 1976 Syria threatened to intervene militarily after the Christian Maronite militia, on 4 January, besieged the Palestinian camps, Tel al-Za'atar and Jisr al-Basha, in a concerted drive to clear the region of "alien" elements. On 18 January 1976 Lebanese Christian forces triggered a crisis for Syria when they overran Karantina, al-Maslakh, and al-Naba's, predominantly Muslim towns in the self-declared "Christian Heartland," north of Beirut, and proceeded to expel their residents. The following day Syria responded by dispatching to Lebanon the Yarmouk Brigade of the Syrian controlled Palestine Liberation Army, in response to appeals by Lebanese leftist Muslim leaders. On the 19th as well, Syria sent a delegation to Lebanon to try to impose an effective cease-fire.  Shortly after Syria came to the rescue of the Muslim Lebanese and Palestinians, Syrian threat perceptions began to change. President Asad had made a proposal to resolve the internal Lebanon conflict: retain the confessional system but replace the numerical proportionate basis of allocating political power with equality between the Christian and Muslim communities. This would entail a 50-50 representation in the legislature and a reduction of the Maronite president's authority in favor of the Sunni Muslim prime minister. The plan was accepted by the Christians but was rejected by the Muslims and the Palestinians. Thus Syria no longer saw the Christians as the catalyst to a Lebanese partition; rather, it was now the Muslim leftists and their PLO allies who, on the momentum of successive victories, threatened the fragile Lebanese equilibrium.  On 28 March Syria decided to place an embargo on all arms supplies to the leftist-PLO coalition. By 9 April Syria was sending clear signals to the leftists that Syrian troops concentrating on the Lebanese border would be brought into use if their intransigence persisted. On 1 June Syrian troops poured into Lebanon in order to force a resolution of the conflict. The immediate--and successful--goal was the relief of some Christian villages under siege. The Syrian advance against the Muslim leftist-PLO forces continued throughout the summer. On 28 September Syria decided to inflict a military defeat on them to be followed immediately by peace talks in which the Syrian point of view would be imposed. A concerted offensive, in alliance with Christian forces but restrained so as not to destroy the Muslim-PLO camp entirely, smashed all Palestinian forces in the Lebanese mountains. By 30 September all opposition in Lebanon to Syria's hegemony had been overcome and partition had been averted. However, the crisis lingered until an Arab Deterrent Force was authorized by the Arab League in October, composed of 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian troops, which occupied the center of Beirut on 15 November. Shortly thereafter, Syria reverted to its traditional pro-Palestinian stance after tension and clashes between Syrian and Christian forces, supporting the PLO against the Israeli-backed Christian militias.  Secretary-General Waldheim offered his good offices for UN mediation, but it was refused. U.S. activity consisted of verbal approbation of Syrian actions and serving as a conduit between Syria and Israel, relaying intentions and information. The USSR supported Syria until the 1 June invasion--to which it was strongly opposed. Arms deliveries to Damascus were halted. Syria's careful efforts not to provoke Israel by crossing the "Red Line" of the Litani River kept the latter out of the Lebanon fighting. During the crisis an Iraqi troop movement to the Syrian border precipitated another crisis for Syria from 9 to 17 June (see Case #269--Iraqi Threat).
Ugandan claims to Kenyan territory caused a crisis for Kenya from 15 to 24 February 1976. Disputes between Uganda and the two other members of the East African Community, Kenya and Tanzania, had occurred for five years prior to this crisis. In 1971 and 1972 confrontations took place between Uganda and Tanzania over Idi Amin's allegations of Tanzanian support for exiled Ugandans (see Cases #245 and #247). During the next several years Idi Amin's behavior became more aggressive. There was a gradual deterioration of relations between Uganda and Kenya since 1975. On 15 February 1976 a crisis was triggered for Kenya when Idi Amin announced that large parts of Kenya and the Sudan historically belonged to Uganda and that he was investigating the possibility of claiming these territories. The disputed area extended to within 20 miles of Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Amin stated further that, despite his preference for peace, he would consider engaging Kenya in war in order to recover the territory. Should Uganda's access to the sea be denied by any country (Kenya or Tanzania), war would be the result. The following day another Amin statement, while withdrawing an actual claim to the areas, guaranteed the security of any Ugandans within that territory who sought independence. He also intimated that he was connected with the Luos secession movement in western Kenya. Kenya responded on 17 February when President Kenyatta addressed a mass rally, stating Kenya's readiness to fight to protect its territorial integrity. Amin cabled the OAU Secretary-General setting forth Ugandan claims, along with vague threats accompanying a denial of any intention to go to war. The OAU never met to discuss the issue. Amin approached the UN as well, but there was no activity by the global organization either. In Kenya protests were held in the town of Kakamega. On 20 February Kenyatta canceled two ministerial meetings of the East African Community and refused to participate in any further Community work until the issue between Uganda and Kenya was settled. On 23 February dockworkers in Mombassa boycotted Ugandan cargo. The crisis ended on 24 February when Kenyatta received a message from Amin disavowing any intention to seize territory from Kenya or Sudan.  (A telephone conversation between the two presidents was reported the following day dealing with matters other than territorial claims.)  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
The first of several international crises arising from the struggle for black majority rule in Rhodesia erupted on 22 February and ended in April 1976. Rhodesia and Mozambique were the crisis actors. War between Rhodesia and Zambia, Mozambique, and Botswana had been raging since 1976 when Rhodesia set up a War Council to supervise the destruction of guerrilla bases in those countries. Beginning in February 1976 Rhodesian troops and aircraft repeatedly raided across the 1,200-kilometer border with Mozambique in order to harass Zimbabwean guerrillas before they could infiltrate into Rhodesia, and to strike at economic targets in a bid to drive home to the Maputo regime the high cost of its support for the Zimbabwean insurgents. Systematic guerrilla activity against Rhodesia's UDI had begun in December 1972 but was restricted to the northeast. When the campaign spread throughout the country in 1976 Rhodesia became involved in a full-scale war. The scale of operations also changed, as large groups of guerrillas entered Rhodesia, operating from Mozambique, Botswana, and Zambia.  The heads of state of the "Front-line States"--Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia--met in Mozambique on 7 and 8 February 1976. There they reaffirmed the need for an armed struggle to achieve majority rule in Rhodesia. On the 8th Mozambique President Machel threatened to invade Rhodesia. Constitutional talks between Rhodesia's Prime Minister Smith and Nkomo, representing the African National Council, were resumed on 10 February. The first clash between Rhodesian security forces and unidentified guerrillas from across the Mozambique border, a three-hour battle on 22 February 1976, triggered a crisis for Rhodesia. Further guerrilla activity was reported in the Chipinga district, 180 miles south of the northeastern border, on the 24th. Rhodesia responded that day by launching Operation Thrasher, an attack on ZANLA bases near its southeastern border with Mozambique, causing the deaths of a number of people and extensive damage, which in turn triggered a crisis for Mozambique. Machel described the attack as an "act of war" and stated that Mozambique forces had shot down Rhodesian aircraft and helicopters, a claim that was not backed by other sources. The Mozambique response was to meet the Rhodesian forces with violence, an announcement on 3 March that all communications with Rhodesia had been banned, and the imposition of sanctions--including the confiscation of all Rhodesian property and assets in Mozambique in accordance with earlier UN and OAU resolutions. On the 8th Mozambique closed its border with Rhodesia, and the country was put on a war footing.  The crisis for Rhodesia faded in March 1976 with a temporary halt in guerrilla activities. The Smith-Nkomo talks ended in deadlock on 19 March with each side blaming the other. The crisis ended in April for Mozambique with a decision to set up a joint institute for the training of defense and police forces with Tanzania and Zambia.  The Security Council met in March and adopted a resolution on the 17th condemning Rhodesia. Mozambique's foreign minister appealed to the Council for $57 million in aid to cover the loss of revenue for Mozambique from the UN imposition of sanctions against Rhodesia. Another Security Council resolution on 6 April strengthened the sanctions. The OAU supported UN sanctions and granted military aid to the guerrillas.  The United States' involvement was limited to several statements by Secretary of State Kissinger favorable to Mozambique. The Soviet Union supplied weapons to both of Rhodesia's guerrilla organizations, ZIPRA and ZANLA.
A Polisario attack on Mauritania's capital caused a one-day crisis for Mauritania on 8 June 1976. On 8 June 1976 a force of 600-700 Polisario guerrillas attacked the city of Nouakchott, threatening Mauritania's political regime. The attack took the form of a lightning mortar and machine-gun offensive with several mortar shells falling around the presidential palace of Ould Daddah, causing turmoil and panic in the city. The Mauritanian response came immediately after the firing when troops reportedly crushed the attacking forces, killing Polisario leader El-Ouali. The remaining Polisario troops withdrew after an hour, thus terminating the crisis on the day of the attack. Nouakchott was attacked a second time in March 1977.  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN or the OAU, was active in this crisis.
An Iraqi troop concentration on its border with Syria caused a crisis for Syria from 9 to 17 June 1976. Events in the Middle East in 1976 were complex. A civil war was raging in Lebanon, with Syrian military participation in an attempt to avert a partition of Lebanon (see Case #265--Lebanon Civil War I). Syria's 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Israel (see Case #255--October-Yom Kippur War, in 1973, in Arab/Israel PC) had facilitated an uneasy truce between the two enemies, with Syria maintaining a division on its border in the Golan Heights. Iraq's relations with the rival Ba'ath regime in Syria were visibly tense. In addition, disputes between Iraq and Syria's ally, Iran, over the Shatt-al-Arab had never been solved (see Cases #172, #234, in 1959-60, 1969, in Iran/Iraq PC). In June 1976 Syria's preoccupation with events in Lebanon afforded Iraq an opportunity to attempt to weaken President Asad's regime. On 9 June 1976, in a sudden and surprise act, Iraq moved troops to its border with Syria, triggering a crisis for the latter. Part of Syria's army was engaged in the civil war in Lebanon, with much of its forces protecting Syria's border with Israel. A tacit agreement with Israel was sought to allow Syria to transfer troops from the Golan Heights. When this was achieved Syria responded on 13 June by removing its division from the Golan Heights and placing it on the Iraqi border. On 17 June the crisis ended when President Asad signaled the decline of threat perception by leaving the country for a three-day visit to France. Soon after the forces of both Iraq and Syria withdrew from the border to their original positions.  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN or the Arab League, was involved in this crisis.
Jewish hostages were held in Entebbe in a PLO-generated crisis for Israel and Uganda from 27 June to 4 July 1976. Guerrilla war against Israel by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took several forms, including the hijacking of planes from Israel's national carrier, El Al, or other airlines carrying Israeli passengers. After strict security controls were instituted, these acts diminished in number. However, the security conditions at some airports remained less stringent. One of these was Athens. On 27 June 1976 an Air France plane en route from Tel Aviv to Paris was hijacked shortly after a stopover in Athens by an armed group belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), including persons from Germany's Bader-Meinhof terrorist organization. This triggered a crisis for Israel. The pilot was forced to fly to Libya where the plane spent nine hours. Later it reached Entebbe in Uganda. The passengers were taken to the airport's former terminal building and divided into two groups--Israelis and Jews, and members of other nationalities. The latter were released shortly thereafter. The French crew remained with the former.  When it became apparent that Uganda's President, Idi Amin, had no intention of pressing for the release of the Jewish and Israeli passengers, Israel began to consider a military operation for their rescue. A decision to that effect was made on 1 July. On the 3rd three Hercules transport planes carrying Israeli commando troops landed in Entebbe, fought Ugandan soldiers in a one-hour battle, and succeeded in rescuing the hostages still being held at the airport. The arrival of Israeli troops and the military hostilities triggered a very short crisis for Uganda. The crisis ended on the 4th when the rescue team, together with the hostages, landed safely in Israel after a stop for fuel at Nairobi Airport. After the rescue, Amin blamed Kenya for aiding Israel and instituted several economic measures against its neighbor. In Arab League discussions Israel was condemned for the raid on Uganda, but no resolution was passed.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
A Libyan-backed attempt to overthrow President Numeiri caused a crisis for Sudan from 2 to 15 July 1976. With Sudan's independence on 1 January 1956 the predominantly Muslim north was united with the Christian and animist south. Regional diversity persisted in the postindependence period, with the most acute domestic problem being the question of Sudan's southern provinces, where open rebellion to the regime began in 1963. Harsh military action caused a large number of southern Sudanese to take refuge in neighboring countries. A guerrilla war began in January 1964. The unrest in the south was one of the main reasons for the bloodless military coup staged by a group of army officers under Colonel Numeiri in May 1969, which invested absolute powers in a National Revolutionary Council. Numeiri formally recognized southern autonomy and attempted to include southern political leaders in the government.  Negotiations with the Anya-Nya guerrilla organization, based in Uganda, began in 1971. The following year the civil war ended in Sudan, but hostilities in the south persisted. Relations between Sudan and Libya were strained. The former, together with Egypt and Sa'udi Arabia, was in the Western camp; Libya was strongly supported by the USSR. Libyan forces in Chad were another bone of contention between Libya, which wished them to remain, and Sudan, which advocated their withdrawal (see Case #243--Chad/Libya I, in Chad/Libya PC). Libya's leader, Qaddhafi, took advantage of Sudan's north/south problem and Numeiri's absence from the country to encourage an attempt to overthrow Sudan's government. Minutes after President Numeiri arrived at Khartoum airport, on his return from a visit to the United States and France, on 2 July 1976, grenades exploded in many parts of the city, and armed civilians advanced on the airport. The coup was suppressed by loyal government troops after some loss of life and considerable damage to property. Sudan accused Libya of designing the coup attempt and of an act of armed aggression: Libya, Numeiri claimed, provided training, arms, ammunition, and transport to the rebels. A complaint was lodged by Sudan in the Security Council on 4 July, and on the 6th Sudan broke off diplomatic relations with Libya. The crisis ended for Sudan with the signing of a joint Defense Agreement between Egypt and Sudan on 15 July: Libya was defined as the common enemy in the agreement.  The OAU and the Arab League were both involved in this crisis, although neither regional organization had any effect on the outcome: the latter urged President Numeiri to withdraw his complaint to the Security Council with a promise that his accusations against Libya would be investigated. The UN was inactive, as were both superpowers.
Greece and Turkey experienced a crisis over disputed rights to Aegean Sea resources from 6 August to 25 September 1976. Greece had long claimed an exclusive right to the continental shelf off each of its Aegean islands. Turkey disputed the claim. Their protracted conflict flared up again on 15 July 1976, when Turkey's prime minister announced that a Turkish "research vessel," the Sizmik I, would prospect for oil in the Aegean Sea before the end of the month. On the 19th Greece threatened military retaliation if Turkey violated its jurisdiction in the Aegean. And on the 29th Greece dispatched several warships to patrol the area. The Sizmik I sailed from Canakkale on 6 August, accompanied by a Turkish minesweeper and military aircraft. This triggered a crisis for Greece, which filed a complaint with Turkey immediately. On the 12th Athens declared a state of alert for all Greek troops along the border with Turkey. Almost all of the Greek air force was moved to advanced bases. And the Greek navy began patrolling the eastern Aegean, where the Turkish vessel continued to take seismic soundings. Greece also complained to the UN Security Council and appealed to the International Court of Justice.  The Greek military response of 12 August triggered a crisis for Turkey. Both parties entered into negotiations under U.S. auspices. The Security Council passed a resolution urging negotiations and providing a framework for crisis resolution. The U.S. and the Soviet Union also encouraged the parties to negotiate. In September the Turkish navy announced that its "research ship" would cease operations in the Aegean. On 25 September it returned to Turkish waters, terminating the first of three crises on this aspect of the Greece/Turkey conflict (see Cases #349 and #376).
A Rhodesian "hot pursuit" operation precipitated a second crisis for Mozambique on 9 August 1976 ending in November of that year. In March 1976 President Machel had announced the closure of his country's borders with Rhodesia, and Mozambique was put on a war footing (see Case #267--Operation Thrasher). A sharp rise in guerrilla activity had increased Rhodesian hot pursuit operations since Rhodesia's war spread to its eastern border with Mozambique. Early in August guerrilla attacks on Rhodesian security forces occurred at a camp at Ruda. On 9 August 1976 Rhodesian forces raided a guerrilla camp at Nagomia, Mozambique, and triggered a crisis for that state: it was reported that more than 300 Zimbabweans were killed. This dramatic operation, in which, according to Mozambique sources, approximately 600 were killed, was the largest raid across the border by Rhodesia. Mozambique responded on 11 August with a 30-minute mortar attack by government troops on a white residential suburb in Umtali, Rhodesia, close to the Mozambique border. Mozambique requested an investigation by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: it subsequently reported that the Pungwe camp on the Nagomia road was a refugee camp containing 8,000 black Rhodesians and that many women and children were among the 500 dead counted by UN officials. Rhodesia, on the other hand, produced captured documents on 29 August to provide evidence that the camp was a military base for several thousand Rhodesian African nationalist guerrillas. Further attacks on Mozambique territory were reported during August.  On 6 September the "Front-Line States" (then Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia) met in Dar es Salaam to coordinate their defense policies. Secretary of State Kissinger arrived in the area on the 13th, and soon thereafter agreements were concluded for $10 million in U.S. aid to Mozambique. Mozambique's foreign minister addressed the UN General Assembly on 5 October. And at a meeting in November 1976 of the Inter-State Defense Commission, created by the Front-Line States, it was decided to organize joint action for their defense. This ended the crisis for Mozambique.  The USSR, which had been supplying military, medical, and other aid to the guerrillas, published a condemnation of Rhodesia in Pravda in August.
The United States and North Korea were enmeshed in a crisis in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from 17 August to 16 September 1976. Since the end of the Korean War (1950-53) there had been many incidents and several full-scale crises between North Korea and South Korea and/or the U.S.  The most recent were Pueblo in 1968 and EC-121 Spy Plane in 1969 (see Cases #224 and #233, in Multiregional PCs: East/West). High tension in and near the DMZ was endemic, with a potential for instantaneous military flare-ups. One such outbreak generated a crisis in the summer of 1976. During the first half of August there were several indicators of a North Korean perception of higher-than-normal threat. One was a White Paper issued on the 5th by the Pyongyang regime, which declared that "war may break out at any moment," that is, a U.S.-South Korean invasion of the North. Another was President Kim Il-Sung's cancellation, on the 15th, of his planned trip to Sri Lanka to participate in the conference of the Non-Aligned Movement. But the catalyst was a curious incident.  On 6 August, after notifying North and South Korea of its (the UN Command's) intent to enter the Joint Security Area (JSA) of the DMZ for construction work, six South Korean workers and four UN (U.S.) guards approached a poplar tree, which had long obscured the view from one UN observation post to another, with the intention of cutting it down. North Korean guards immediately demanded their withdrawal, and they complied. Neither the commander of UN forces nor Washington was yet aware of this episode. It required a more dramatic incident to trigger a full-scale crisis. On 17 August, in a scuffle between forces of the UN Command and the North Korean People's Army, two U.S. soldiers were killed and nine wounded in the JSA of the DMZ: they were members of a group of 15 who had entered the area to prune the poplar tree. This triggered a crisis for the United States. President Ford was informed immediately. In an initial response the State Department demanded that the Pyongyang regime do the following: accept responsibility for the casualties; pledge that such an incident would not occur again; and punish those who perpetrated the attack. More significantly, two meetings of the crisis management group in the Ford (and Nixon) administrations, the WSAG (Washington Special Action Group), on 18 and 19 August, led to a series of visible military measures. These included the dispatch of a squadron of 20 F-111s and a navy task force, including an aircraft carrier, along with a B-52 training mission, to South Korea; and the placing of U.S. forces in South Korea on a higher state of alert--Defcon (Defense Condition) 3, the same as in the 1973 October-Yom Kippur crisis-war and only slightly lower than in the Cuban Missile crisis. U.S. decision makers at the highest level (Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger) perceived this incident as a test of their resolve and a challenge to U.S. influence worldwide.  The U.S. military response, though non-violent, triggered a crisis for North Korea on the 19th. Kim Il-Sung responded the same day with an order for a war posture by the Korean People's Army, reserves, and all auxiliary forces. The next day the U.S. president approved General Stilwell's plan to cut down the poplar tree--to demonstrate U.S. resolve--but with strict orders not to use force first. "Operation Paul Bunyan" was implemented on the 21st, with U.S. bombers and fighters flying over South Korean airspace, B-52 strategic bombers flying close to the DMZ, and 26 helicopter-gunships protecting the special unit of tree cutters, protected by U.S. and South Korean troops. The operation was completed without violence. It was the most dramatic show of U.S. force in Korea since the Korean War.  The Poplar Tree crisis began to wind down with a rare statement by Kim Il-Sung on 22 August, within hours of the completion of Operation Paul Bunyan. It was conveyed by North Korea's foreign minister to his U.S. counterpart at Panmunjom. "It is regretful that an incident occurred....; an effort will be made so that such incidents may not recur in the future"; and "Our side will never provoke first." After an initial cool reaction, because it did not meet the three U.S. conditions, the State Department, on 23 August, termed the message "a positive step."  The de-escalation phase had begun. After several meetings within the framework of the Military Armistice Committee (MAC) beginning on 25 August, the U.S. and North Korea signed a new JSA agreement on 6 September. It took effect on 16 September, marking the end of the most serious international crisis in Korea since the Korean War. The outcome was a compromise, an informal apology by North Korea, with the U.S. desisting from its three-condition ultimatum.  The USSR, on 19 August, called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. North Korea's other ally, the PRC, remained aloof from this crisis. So too did the UN, other than the UN (U.S.) Command in Korea. The conference of Non-Aligned States in Sri Lanka passed a resolution condemning U.S. acts.
A Syrian army advance toward southern Lebanon precipitated a crisis for Israel from 21 November to 13 December 1976. In an attempt to avoid the partition of Lebanon during the latter's civil war, Syrian troops entered Lebanon in January 1976 (see Case #265--Lebanon Civil War I, in Middle East: Non-PCs). By September Syria had defeated Palestinian and Lebanese Muslim leftists and remained in control of large areas of the country. In the middle of October a summit meeting of the heads of state of Arab countries took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On 18 October a comprehensive peace plan for Lebanon was signed, setting up an Arab Deterrent Force, consisting almost entirely of Syrian troops. By 20 November Syria controlled all the key points in Lebanon with the exception of the area south of the Litani River bordering Israel. A tacit agreement was reached with Israel marking the Litani as the "Red Line," whereby both countries avoided confrontation. On 21 November, as Syrian forces pushed toward south Lebanon, Israel perceived a crisis, recognizing that Syria might break the tacit Red Line agreement, thereby undermining Israel's influence in Lebanon. Israel responded the following day by concentrating infantry and tanks along its northern border with Lebanon. In Jerusalem Prime Minister Rabin met with U.S. Ambassador Lewis to discuss the situation on 23 November, while in Washington talks were held between Ambassador Dinitz and U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger. The Syrians halted at the Litani River. By 13 December the situation stabilized and the tacit agreement between the two countries was restored, a process to which the U.S. contributed greatly. The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
The extension of Rhodesia's military operations against African guerrillas to the border area with Botswana caused a crisis for Botswana from 20 December 1976 to 31 March 1977. In February 1976 Rhodesia had launched Operation Thrasher to deal with military incursions by Mozambique-based guerrillas into its territory (see Case #267). During that year a number of guerrilla operations were mounted from Botswana staging camps. Rhodesia's security forces dramatically increased their incursions into Botswana, which issued a public accusation on 12 August. In November a villager was killed and several bombs exploded in Francistown at the office of the African National Council (ANC). On 15 December Rhodesian forces raided a village on the border and kidnapped three Botswana citizens. Three days later fire was exchanged between Botswana police and Rhodesian troops. And on the 20th Botswana claimed that its territory had been violated by Rhodesian forces 31 times since the beginning of November 1976. On 20 December 1976 the Rhodesian government announced the creation of a new operational military zone--Operation Tangent--in the northwest and west covering the Botswana border area. This announcement triggered a crisis for Botswana, particularly because it had no army, only a police force. Botswana responded by declaring the 30-kilometer border with Rhodesia a protected area, imposing a curfew, and appealing to the UN Security Council on 21 December. It also set up a Police Mobile Unit to patrol the border and expanded it in January 1977. The Security Council met on 14 January and condemned Rhodesian incursions into Botswana, demanding the cessation of all hostile acts. The Council accepted a Botswana invitation to send a mission to assess its needs and requested the Secretary-General to organize immediately financial and other forms of assistance to Botswana and to report back to the Council not later than 31 March. The UN mission, which visited Botswana in February, reported that there was evidence of Rhodesian incursions and stated that Botswana's difficulties had been increased severely by the influx of refugees. The report recommended a $50 million grant over three years, half to reinforce the Police Mobile Unit and the rest for the care of refugees. The same day, 31 March 1977, Botswana decided to establish an army, terminating its crisis.  The USSR offered economic aid to Botswana. There was no U.S. involvement in this crisis.
An invasion of Zaire by Katangan exiles based in Angola brought about a crisis for Zaire and Angola from 8 March to 26 May 1977. Rebel forces in the Congo (later, Zaire) fled across the border to Angola and Zambia after Colonel Mobutu instigated a successful coup in Zaire in November 1965 (see Case #211--Congo II, in 1964, in Africa: Non-PCs). In Angola, members of the Congolese National Liberation Front (FLNC) were trained and aided by personnel and equipment from the Soviet Union and Cuba. During 1966 and 1967 armed rebels in Angola received assistance from Zaire, while Portugal supported separatist sentiments in Angola. Border incidents intensified as guerrilla movements became stronger. These conflicts continued throughout the Angolan civil war, with Zaire complaining to the UN Security Council on several occasions of rebel incursions from Angolan territory into its southern province of Shaba. On 8 March 1977 Katangan exiles residing in Angola invaded Shaba, triggering a crisis for Zaire. A crisis for Angola was triggered the same day when President Mobutu accused Angola, together with Cuba and the USSR, of being involved in an attempt to overthrow his regime. Angola feared an attack on its territory from Zaire and an internationalization of the conflict. Zaire responded with force on the day of the attack but, aware of its inability to repel the invaders alone, sent an appeal for help to African states, Belgium, and the United States. Morocco dispatched 1,500 troops in a French-supplied airlift. Pilots and mechanics were sent from Egypt. The U.S. supplied nonlethal aid. Angola responded on 11 March with a statement by the Defense Ministry disclaiming any responsibility for the invasion. On that day the FLNC announced in Paris that the goal of the invasion was to overthrow Mobutu's regime.  With the help of Moroccan troops and French advisors the Zairian army was able to stop the advance of the Katangan exiles and, subsequently, to reoccupy all the towns and villages. The Moroccans completed their mission on 22 May and withdrew, as did the Egyptians on the 25th. When the foreign troops left Zaire, Angola's fear of internationalization of the conflict subsided, and its crisis terminated on 25 May. The following day Zairian troops recaptured the last town held by the secessionist rebels in Shaba, ending Zaire's crisis and the Shaba crisis as a whole.  Nigeria provided a strong mediation role during the crisis, through the efforts of Foreign Minister Brigadier Joseph Garba. Prior to the onset of crisis, Garba met with Mobuto in Kinshasha on 3 March in a first attempt to help resolve the differences between Angola and Zaire. Throughout the crisis Garba provided good offices, actively pursued the normalization of relations, and urged both sides to control the insurgents taking refuge in their own borders. Although it seemed that a meeting between Garba and Mobutu on 26 April might lead to an agreement that would involve an inter-African observer group, the mediation ultimately failed to achieve a sustainable agreement between the two countries. The mediation efforts did not involve direct communication with the FLNC.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
Rhodesian raids on guerrilla camps inside Mozambique caused a third crisis for that state from 29 May to 30 June 1977. On 29 May 1977 Rhodesia's military command announced that security forces, with air support, had entered southwest Mozambique and had overrun guerrilla bases. The attack triggered a crisis for Mozambique. The same day its minister of defense stated that the Rhodesian military operation had been directed at military installations. On 30 May, after more raids, Mozambique announced a counteroffensive. The following day the crisis escalated when the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces announced that troops had occupied the town of Mapai and were prepared to stay in Mozambique as long as necessary in order to destroy the ZANLA guerrillas in the area.  Rhodesia's actions drew strong condemnations from the international community. On 1 June UN Secretary-General Waldheim condemned Rhodesia, as did the U.S. and the U.K. Even South African Prime Minister Vorster issued a statement of concern that the Rhodesian action would lead to increased communist (Cuban) activity in southern Africa.  Rhodesia's troops withdrew from Mapai on 1-2 June, but the tension level remained high. On 18 June Mozambique's President Machel accused Rhodesia of waging open warfare against his country and requested a meeting of the UN Security Council. The Council passed a resolution at the end of June condemning Rhodesia for aggression against Mozambique. The resolution also requested immediate and substantial material assistance to enable Mozambique to strengthen its defense capability in order to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution, on 30 June, ended Mozambique's crisis. There was no USSR involvement.
Guatemalan claims to Belize caused a second crisis for the U.K. from 25 June to 28 July 1977. Belize's independence had been delayed for many years because of Guatemala's threats to invade the territory once it became independent, claiming historic rights to its annexation. In 1975 Britain perceived a threat that Guatemala would invade Belize (see Case #262--Belize I). The issue had been discussed in the United Nations General Assembly year after year. In the early summer of 1977 the possibility of independence for Belize once more precipitated Guatemalan action. On 17 June Guatemala's defense minister stated that his country's forces were waiting for word from the president to begin the recovery of Belize. On 25 June 1977 Guatemalan troops were deployed to the Belize border area, and reservists were called up. This action triggered a crisis for the U.K., which was responsible for Belize's security. It was followed by a statement from President Garcia on 1 July affirming Guatemala's rights to the territory. The U.K. responded on 6 July by dispatching air, infantry, and naval forces to the area. HMS Achilles took up position in Belizean waters, and British troops were moved to within two miles of Guatemala's border. At the request of the United States, British Minister of State Edward Rowlands visited Washington to hold talks with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. Vance then held separate talks with Guatemala's Foreign Minister Adolfo Molina and a Belizean delegation led by Premier George Price. These talks focused on decreasing the military tension in the border region, and it was decided that Rowlands would visit Guatemala. He did so from 26 to 28 July and provided assurances that the U.K. would not be an aggressor. A joint communiqué was issued on the 28th in which both sides agreed to take steps to reduce the border tension, adding that there would be no sudden move to independence for Belize, thus terminating the U.K. crisis over Belize.  The United States welcomed the outcome of the talks. The UN was not involved in this crisis.  (The independence of Belize was proclaimed in 1981.)
A second Polisario attack on Mauritania's capital, on 3 July 1977, precipitated another crisis for Mauritania lasting until late that month. During the year after Nouakchott I, the Moroccan and Mauritanian armies had undergone major expansion to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of Polisario attacks, the former from 60,000 to 90,000, the latter from 3,000 to 12,000. On 13 May 1977 the Moroccan-Mauritanian Supreme Defense Committee was established to deal with the Western Sahara problem. Its first meeting took place in June. Polisario forces, backed by Algeria, attacked the capital of Mauritania on 3 July 1977, triggering a second crisis for Mauritania. Polisario claimed to have caused heavy losses and damage; Mauritania reported one civilian and one soldier killed. On 12 July the Mauritanian permanent representative to the UN sent a letter to the president of the Security Council accusing Algeria of responsibility for both the attack on Nouakchott and an assault on the Mauritanian ambassador in Paris, and requested an urgent meeting of the Council. However, no UN activity took place. On 15 July Mauritania responded with a reorganization of key positions in its armed forces. The following day the city of Zouerate was attacked by Polisario. And on 18 and 19 July Morocco airlifted 600 troops to Mauritania. Toward the end of July the reorganization of the Mauritanian army had been completed and the threat to the regime was reduced, terminating the crisis for Mauritania.  The OAU met between 2 and 5 July in Gabon and arranged for a special meeting on Western Sahara for October 1977. The U.S. and the USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
Border clashes between Libya and Egypt created a crisis for these two north African states from 14 July to 10 September 1977. The problem of undemarcated boundaries between Egypt and Libya was long-standing. The personal enmity between President Sadat and Colonel Qaddhafi increased after the conclusion of the October 1973 war between Egypt and Israel, when the Libyan leader accused Sadat of working toward a thaw in Egypt/Israel relations, as well as developing stronger ties with the United States. Egypt, on the other hand, resented the increasing Muslim fundamentalism in Libya and feared the spread of Soviet influence then prevalent in that country. For several years the two African neighbors had accused each other of acts of sabotage and had carried on an almost unbroken propaganda campaign (see Case #314--Libya's Threat to Sadat, in 1980). A crisis was triggered for Libya when Egyptian armed forces attacked a Libyan border police fort on 14 July 1977. The Libyan response, on 19 July, was artillery fire on an Egyptian border post killing nine soldiers and capturing 14. This triggered a crisis for Egypt. On the 21st Egyptian forces, supported by tanks and aircraft, crossed the border into Libya. During August intermittent clashes continued, with each side accusing the other of aggression. Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, along with President Boumedienne of Algeria, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and Foreign Minister Shaikh Sabah al Ahmad al Jabir as Sabah of Kuwait, succeeded in mediating the crisis. The mediators traveled to both countries, worked out a peace formula and called for a cease-fire on 24 July that was upheld. On 10 September Egyptian and Libyan troops withdrew from the border, terminating the crisis for both actors.  The United States provided arms and weapons to Egypt, as did the Soviet Union to Libya. Libya brought the matter before the United Nations, the Arab League, and the OAU, but no discussion took place.
The continuing dispute over the territory of Ogaden generated another crisis between Ethiopia and Somalia from 22 July 1977 to 14 March 1978. After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, the marxist ruling group in Addis Ababa, the Derge, turned to Moscow for military support. From 1977 a large contingent of Cuban troops was stationed in Ethiopia to assist the marxist regime against its domestic enemies and Somali irredentism. Somalia responded by realigning with the United States.  The revolution of 1974 that overthrew the monarchy in Ethiopia also generated an upsurge of competing regional nationalisms. Brutal repression was practiced by the Mengistu regime. Ten out of Ethiopia's 14 provinces were in a state of armed insurrection against the central government in Addis Ababa. Its failure to suppress the revolt in Eritrea, along with the hostility of Ethiopia's other neighbors, was perceived in Mogadishu as an opportunity to realize the long-standing Somali goal of liberating Ogaden. On 22 July 1977 the Somalia-backed Western Somalia Liberation Front (WSLF) mounted a full-scale attack in the Ogaden region, triggering a crisis for Ethiopia. Within days most of Ogaden was overrun; and Somali troops pushed on to capture a score of Ethiopian posts on the outskirts of the Ogaden Desert. Ethiopia responded on 7 August by severing diplomatic relations with Somalia. By October, 90 percent of the Ogaden had been captured by Somali forces: Somalia was on the threshold of total victory.  At that point the Soviet Union came to the aid of Ethiopia with an airlift of weapons. And after Somalia broke relations with the USSR and Cuba, the Soviets poured air force and army advisors, along with thousands of Cuban troops from Angola, into Ethiopia.  The counteroffensive by Ethiopian and Cuban forces began on 21 January 1978, triggering a crisis for Somalia. Jijiga, which had fallen to the Somalis in September 1977, was retaken in early March 1978; and, despite U.S. military aid, the Somalis were now a broken force. The dramatic Ethiopian breakthrough was masterminded by the Cubans and Soviets. On 9 March Somalia announced its intended withdrawal from the Ogaden region, conceding victory to Ethiopia. The withdrawal was completed on 14 March 1978, terminating the crisis--but not the protracted conflict--for both states.  The OAU's mediation committee, created in 1973, attempted to mediate during the crisis unsuccessfully. On 8-9 August 1977, delegates from the OAU met with Somali and Ethiopian leaders. The mediators reaffirmed the inviolability of borders from the colonial era, which caused the Somali representation to be dissatisfied and walk out of the negotiations. Somalia also turned down all additional attempts at mediation.  The U.S. provided Somalia with weapons. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
Rhodesian air raids on ZIPRA bases in Zambia brought about a crisis for that state from 31 August 1977 until 14 August 1978. Despite ongoing discussions in search of an acceptable constitutional settlement to the Rhodesian conflict, the situation deteriorated in 1977. In May of that year the British government released information that claimed that Rhodesia's Prime Minister Smith had proposed to take preemptive action against guerrilla attacks on the grounds that a buildup of African forces was taking place on the Zambian side of Rhodesia's border. Zambia was the home base for ZAPU and its revolutionary army, ZIPRA. On 16 May Zambia's President Kaunda said that a state of war existed with Rhodesia. On 8 July he stated that his country had approached one or two other states, presumably Cuba and Somalia, for aid. Earlier, on 8 June, Rhodesia accused Zambia of a rocket attack and threatened to disconnect Zambia's power from Rhodesia's Kariba hydroelectric station. In August an increasing number of incidents were reported on Rhodesia's borders with Zambia and Botswana. On the 27th it was reported from Zambia that air strikes were feared. In the light of tensions since May and the growing fear in late August, the first incident to take place was likely to trigger a fresh crisis. On 31 August 1977 a crisis was triggered for Zambia when Rhodesian jet bombers strafed the border district of Luanshya causing casualties and damage to property. Kaunda's response, on 3 September, was to impose several days of blackout and curfew in Lusaka, Zambia's capital, and in other cities. On the 7th the blackout and curfew were extended indefinitely when Kaunda invoked full powers under the state of emergency that had existed since Rhodesia's declaration of independence in 1965 (see Case #218--Rhodesia's UDI). On the 11th the president accused Rhodesia of using napalm, which was denied the following day by the Combined Operational Headquarters in Rhodesia. The curfew was lifted on 20 September.  A period of highly conflictual relations between the two states followed. Escalation occurred on 6 March 1978 when Rhodesian forces entered Zambian territory in force with aircraft, helicopters, and ground troops attacking the Luanshya district in what the Smith regime described as "hot pursuit." A secret meeting between Prime Minister Smith and ZAPU leader Nkomo in Lusaka on 14 August 1978 ended Zambia's crisis. The meeting, held under the auspices of President Kaunda, indicated an easing of tension. Smith attempted to bring Nkomo into his domestic support group via changes in the Executive Council of Rhodesia, to include local black representation. The council was set up in March 1978 but had been losing support among Rhodesia's black population.  The UN Security Council met on 15-17 March 1978 and adopted a resolution reaffirming sanctions against Rhodesia, which Zambia had been carrying out fully at great sacrifice. The OAU held discussions without passing a resolution. The United States and Britain attempted to seek implementation of the Anglo-American proposals for a constitutional settlement leading to internationally recognized independence for Rhodesia. There was no USSR involvement in this crisis.  (The Zambian railway to Rhodesia was reopened on 6 October 1978.)
A two-stage post-Vietnam War crisis in Indochina occurred from 24 September 1977 to 7 January 1979. The direct participants were Cambodia, Vietnam, and, on the periphery, Thailand. The deep-rooted conflict between Cambodia and Vietnam derived from many sources: ethnic hatred, traditional hostility, territorial disputes, and ideological differences. In essence, the former was engaged in a persistent struggle to maintain an independent existence against the steady encroachment of the much more powerful Vietnam. In March 1970 Cambodia attempted to expel North Vietnamese and Vietcong military concentrations from its territory (see Case #237--Invasion of Cambodia). Fighting began immediately after the fall of Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, to the Cambodian Maoist Khmer Rouge in April 1975 (see Case #258--Final North Vietnam Offensive). From that time onward the tension was exacerbated by disputes over boundaries imposed by the French colonial administration concerning some potentially oil-rich islands in the Gulf of Siam and, more importantly, threats to the survival of the diminishing Cambodian state. The conflict was intensified by the reluctance of North Vietnam's army to withdraw from acknowledged Cambodian territory after 1975. The persistent border conflict between Cambodia and Vietnam escalated in 1977. In April Cambodian forces staged heavy raids into Vietnam, whose militia guarding the area was forced to withdraw. In May Vietnam unilaterally extended its territorial waters to 12 miles and established a 200-mile "exclusive economic zone" that encompassed islands and archipelagos outside those territorial waters. These acts directly affected islands contested by Vietnam and China (see Case #384--Spratly Islands, in 1988, in China/Vietnam PC), as well as those in dispute between Vietnam and Cambodia. A treaty of economic and defense cooperation between Vietnam and Laos in August 1977 transformed Laos into a Vietnamese client, another step in Vietnam's efforts to gain control over all of Indochina. For Vietnam, a serious refugee problem in an economically strategic area, together with Cambodian attacks, exacerbated the tense situation. Cambodia was troubled by the continued presence of Vietnamese troops in the eastern part of its territory. Cambodia charged Vietnam with a plan to reconstitute the Union Indochinoise established by France, as well as an attempt to instigate an internal coup in Cambodia against the regime. Vietnam countered by accusing Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, of plans to reconquer Saigon and the Mekong Delta, which had belonged to Cambodia 300 years earlier. The Thai/Cambodia conflict was less acute than that between Cambodia and Vietnam. Nevertheless, uncertain borders, poor communication between Phnom Penh and its forces in the field, the lack of discipline among the Khmer Rouge troops, provocative Thai military action, smuggling operations, ideological factors, and the presence of an enormous Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand all contributed to poor relations between Cambodia and Thailand. The beginning of a lengthy crisis for Cambodia and Vietnam can be traced to 24 September 1977: Cambodia reported an invasion by several Vietnam divisions supported by hundreds of tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft; and the same day Vietnam alleged that four divisions of Cambodian forces had launched attacks along the entire border of Tayninh Province where over 1,000 civilians had been killed or wounded. Vietnam's initial response was a punitive assault in December by six divisions 50 miles into Cambodia. After inflicting a substantial defeat Vietnamese troops pulled back, with some units remaining in Cambodia to support subsequent diplomatic approaches. Cambodia moved 13 of its 17 divisions to hold the border against a renewed Vietnamese invasion. On 31 December Phnom Penh broke off diplomatic relations with Hanoi and quietly abandoned its Moscow embassy as well, thereby emphasizing the link between the Indochina dispute and the Sino/Soviet conflict. Vietnamese diplomats were ordered to leave Cambodia; and air services between the two countries were to be suspended as of 7 January 1978. A Vietnamese offer on 3 January to negotiate was rejected by Cambodia. There were contradictory reports concerning the fighting in January. Cambodia claimed to have expelled the Vietnamese after a major victory on 6 January, while Vietnam continued to report incursions into its territory. The Vietnamese invasion was suspended in mid-January, and its forces were gradually withdrawn from Cambodia. From the second half of January until June 1978 Vietnam's forces remained largely on the defensive repelling repeated Cambodian raids across the border. Vietnam's air force began systematic attacks against Cambodia in June 1978. After China cut off all aid to Vietnam the latter joined the Soviet bloc's economic union, COMECON, on 29 June. (Six months later it signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union.) In September 1978 the Khmer Rouge launched another series of raids deep into Vietnam, while the latter continued systematic incursions into Cambodia. Cambodia alleged the participation of foreign nationals--Russians and Cubans--as advisors to Vietnam's artillery companies and tank squadrons. By mid-September Vietnam's policy of minimum military reaction changed. The Thai dimension of this international crisis emerged soon after the end of the first stage of the Cambodia/Vietnam crisis. Despite an agreement on 2 February 1978 to normalize Cambodian/Thai relations, Cambodian troops, often acting in collaboration with Thai communist guerrillas, continued to make frequent raids into Thailand. On the 9th a sharp increase in Cambodia's raids into Thai border villages triggered a crisis for Thailand. Assaults on police posts in the frontier zone and destruction of small nearby population centers took place with no serious obstacles on the part of the Thai army or its border police units. The Thai government, while opting for diplomatic measures to control Cambodia, responded on 10 April with a statement by its prime minister vowing swift and drastic retaliation. With the onset of the second stage of the Cambodia/Vietnam crisis in mid-December and a Cambodian invasion directed at the Vietnamese port of Ha Tien, the scale of incidents in Thailand was reduced, marking the end of its crisis. The second stage of the crisis between Hanoi and Phnom Penh was initiated by Cambodia's intrusion into Vietnam on 15 December 1978. Vietnam responded with a massive and rapid strike into Cambodia on 25 December escalating the crisis for Cambodia (and the PRC--[see Case #298--Sino/Vietnam War, in 1978-79, in China/Vietnam PC]). Cambodia responded on the 31st with a request to the UN to condemn Vietnam and to demand that it cease "aggression" and that all Soviet military aid to Vietnam be stopped. The Cambodian foreign minister also requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. Vietnam's conquest of Cambodia was completed in less than a fortnight. On 7 January 1979 a puppet regime was installed in Phnom Penh terminating the crisis for Vietnam, for Cambodia--by force majeure--and the international crisis as a whole. However, it spilled over to a brief but intense military confrontation between China and Vietnam (see Case #298). Many states were involved in this complex crisis. China and the USSR urged the parties to resolve their disputes through negotiation. At the same time substantial aid programs--the USSR to Vietnam, the PRC to Cambodia--continued throughout the crisis. North Korea sent pilots to fight alongside Cambodia--and China--in the Sino/Vietnam War. The Soviet bloc and Albania supported Vietnam. Laos, Yugoslavia, and Romania remained neutral. The divisions in the communist world were thus widened, a development for which Moscow denounced Beijing. Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand condemned the Vietnam invasion of Cambodia in December 1978 and halted aid to Vietnam, as did Australia, Britain, Denmark, and Japan. The UN Security Council overruled Soviet and Czechoslovak objections and agreed to convene a formal meeting on 11 January 1979. Soviet proposals were rejected. And Prince Sihanouk was invited to address the meeting. A draft resolution was submitted on the 15th but was not adopted because of a Soviet veto. (The Vietnam invasion of Cambodia succeeded in toppling the Pol Pot regime but failed to destroy the Khmer Rouge forces, thereby initiating a protracted guerrilla war for a decade. Under massive international pressure and internal problems Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989.)
As part of the ongoing conflict over Western Sahara, French citizens working in Mauritania were held hostage by Polisario. This created a crisis for France and Algeria from 25 October to 23 December 1977. The Mauritanian town of Zouerate was attacked by Polisario guerrillas on 1 May and 16 July 1977. Zouerate was an important mining settlement housing a fairly large French community, consisting mainly of engineers and their families. In the May attack two French citizens were killed and six others taken prisoner. France, which had been supplying Morocco and Mauritania with arms and instructors, evacuated 450 women and children and issued a strong protest calling on Algeria to use its good offices to free the hostages. In May Mauritania and France considered reactivating their military defense agreements, which the former had terminated in January 1973. France brought the matter before the UN. However, all attempts to release the prisoners met with little success, due mainly to Polisario's unwillingness to cooperate. The abduction of two French engineers working on the Mauritanian railway 60 kilometers west of Zouerate, on 25 October 1977, triggered a crisis for France. On the 28th eight alleged members of Polisario were expelled from France.  France's major response, which was also the trigger to Algeria's crisis, was the placing of French paratroops on alert on 29 October, amid rumors that French troop-carrying aircraft had departed for Senegal. Algeria feared that the French would attack targets on Algerian soil, which housed major Polisario bases and training camps. On the 30th Algeria responded with a démarche from Foreign Minister Bouteflika to the ambassadors from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, drawing their attention to the risks of French intervention in the area and the subsequent danger to international security. On 1-2 November DC-8 and Transall transport planes flew to Dakar with approximately 300 reinforcements for the 1,100 French troops stationed in Cape Vert, Senegal. During the first two weeks in November French instructors were sent to Mauritania to establish communication facilities. From 1 to 7 November a French Foreign Ministry official, Claude Chayets, talked with Polisario leaders in Algiers, and from 5 to 6 November a second official visited the Algerian capital. On 7 November the Front Liberation National (FLN), Algeria's sole legal political organization, staged a demonstration against French threats of intervention--reportedly one of the largest since Algeria's independence from France in 1962. From 12 to 18 December French Jaguar aircraft strafed Polisario columns in Mauritania.  Negotiations with Polisario succeeded in freeing the hostages, who were handed over to UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in Algiers on 23 December 1977. Waldheim played a considerable mediation role throughout the crisis. On 12 November, he met Polisario representatives at UN headquarters in New York City. During the course of the crisis, Waldheim also met with Algerian Foreign Minister Bouteflika and Claude Chayets. The release of the hostages ended the crisis for Algeria and France.  At France's request, the UN General Assembly met on 31 October. The Secretary-General offered his good offices. And a resolution was adopted by the General Assembly on 9 November, calling upon all members to respect Western Sahara's right to self-determination. The U.S. was not involved; the USSR, marginally so.
Rhodesian attacks on bases of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) in Mozambique triggered another crisis for Mozambique from 23 November 1977 to 22 March 1978. After the Mapai Seizure of May-June 1977 (see Case #278), there was a decline in military activity on the Mozambique border. However, in November 1977 the raids of Rhodesian forces into Mozambique were reported to be the heaviest since the guerrilla war had begun. Serious food shortages prevailed in Mozambique prior to the crisis. On 23-24 November 1977 Rhodesian forces attacked the main operational headquarters of ZANLA near Chimoio in Mozambique. This was followed by raids on a base at Tembue, on 25-26 November. These attacks triggered a crisis for Mozambique. Salisbury announced that 1,200 ZANLA "terrorists" had been killed, expressing regret at the possibility of civilian deaths, but emphasizing that Rhodesia was at war and that civilians, particularly women and children, should not be in such camps. On 1 December Prime Minister Smith added that the raids had been essential to stop heavy attacks that had been planned against Rhodesia. ZANLA leader Mugabe denied that the Chimoio camp was a guerrilla base. On 23 December 1977 and on 14-15 February 1978, Rhodesia made public documents it claimed to have seized during the raids listing women guerrillas with their weapons, adding there had been armed clashes between rival ZANLA and ZIPRA (Zimbabwe Peoples Revolutionary Army) units.  President Machel visited Nigeria and Angola for talks between 13 and 17 December; and on the 18th, upon his return to Mozambique, he met with leaders of the "Front-Line States" to discuss joint strategy. At that meeting the presidents of Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia drew up a four-point declaration expressing their support for some aspects of the Anglo-American plan to develop a clear timetable for achieving majority rule in Rhodesia, while reaffirming the unity of their group and its commitment to the Patriotic Front in its "liberation war." Termination of Mozambique's crisis occurred on 22 March when it approved a law for compulsory military service.  The OAU Ministerial Committee met in January 1978 to discuss this crisis. The Rhodesian raids were condemned by the U.K. and the U.S. And the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for assistance to Mozambique. Several months before these Rhodesian raids, arms to aid the guerrillas had been received in Mozambique from both China and the Soviet Union, though neither was directly involved in the crisis.
The century-old dispute over the Beagle Channel erupted into a crisis for Chile and Argentina on 5 December 1977 and ended on 20 February 1978. Since the mid-nineteenth century Argentina and Chile contested the ownership of three tiny islands, Lennox, Nueva, and Picton, located at the eastern entrance to the Beagle Channel, a waterway 150 miles long and 3-8 miles wide in the southern tip of South America. The islands are inhabited by Chilean shepherds and patrolled by Argentinian torpedo boats. The two countries signed an agreement in 1972 referring the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which awarded the islands to Chile on 2 May 1977. Argentina's access to the Atlantic, to its Antarctic bases, and to the potential resources of oil, minerals, and fish in the South Atlantic and Antarctic regions was in jeopardy. On 5 December 1977 the Argentine government delivered a formal Note to Chile objecting to the terms of the court ruling. More important, it called up army reservists in the Mendoza border region the same day, triggering a crisis for Chile. Negotiations between Chile and Argentina ended on 28 December, and all further meetings were canceled. Chile's response, on 5 January, was a speech by President Pinochet stating that his government would henceforth pursue a more aggressive and pragmatic foreign policy. That day it was also reported that Chilean soldiers were being massed between Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas and that tank and infantry maneuvers were in progress with Chilean warships patrolling the Magellan Straits. This activity triggered a crisis for Argentina. Argentinian vessels sailed for the Beagle Channel area and remained offshore on 8 January. Two days later Argentina's naval commander, while observing maneuvers, stated that the navy was ready for action; the air force commander inspected airfields on the Chilean border. The same day President Videla interrupted a vacation to return to Buenos Aires for consultations with the military junta.  Throughout January 1978 Argentina and Chile continued their preparations for a military confrontation. On 19 January Videla and Pinochet met in Mendoza to discuss matters of joint concern, especially the area in dispute. When Argentina once more rejected the ruling by the ICJ, a second meeting between the two presidents was postponed. However, on 20 February they did meet once more and signed the "Act of Puerto Montt" under which a joint negotiating committee was set up and given 180 days to resolve the dispute. The crisis ended for both actors that day with no change in the status quo.  The United States tried to persuade both parties to reduce tension and seek a solution through diplomatic means. The UN and the USSR were not involved.  (Almost two months after the 180-day negotiating period a second crisis over the Beagle Channel occurred [see Case #295].)
Libya's continuing involvement in Chad's internal conflict generated a second crisis for those two states between 22 January and 27 March 1978. In April 1972 Libya occupied the Aozou Strip. (Later that year, on 28 November, Tombalbaye agreed, under pressure, to the cession of the Strip to Libya, and in December 1972 Chad and Libya signed a Treaty of Friendship.)  Chad President Tombalbayé was overthrown in an army coup on 14 April 1975 and was replaced by Felix Malloum, who pledged national unity by peaceful means. Within the opposition FROLINAT, Hissene Habré was ousted from the leadership by Goukouni Oueddei, who led the loosely organized Command Council of the Northern Armies. In April 1976 a Qaddhafi-supported mutiny and planned assassination of President Malloum failed. Throughout 1977 there were continuous pro-Libyan rebel attacks against Chad troops, with Libyan activity reaching its peak in the summer, when FROLINAT forces occupied territory south of the Aozou Strip. As in 1971, Libya perceived a threat to its influence in Chad as a result of a domestic Chadian political agreement, on this occasion between Hissene Habré and President Malloum, signed in Khartoum on 22 January 1978 with the help of Sudan's mediation. The agreement provided for a National Unity Government; the establishment of a constituent assembly; an amnesty for all political prisoners; and the reorganization of Chad's armed forces. Libya's major response, on the 29th, was active support for a FROLINAT offensive against Faya-Largeau, the administrative center of the province of Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti, in northern Chad.  This act, in turn, triggered a crisis for Chad. President Malloum responded by severing diplomatic relations with Libya on 6 February. A Chad appeal to the UN Security Council on the 8th to condemn Libya's involvement in the renewed fighting, as well as its occupation of the Aozou Strip, had to be withdrawn and a cease-fire accepted because of the loss of half the Chad army and the fall of Faya-Largeau to FROLINAT forces on 19 February. Libya halted the advance of its proxy on the Chad capital because of strong pressure by France, then an important arms supplier to Libya, and partly to avoid a clash with French military forces in Chad.  The crisis ended for Libya on 24 February when, at the first Sebha Conference, Chad and Libya agreed to settle their differences in a "new fraternal spirit"; to resume diplomatic relations; to hold a peace conference between the Chad government and FROLINAT on 21 March; and to establish a joint military committee to supervise affairs in Chad during the interim period, thereby legitimizing Libyan intervention in Chad. President Malloum of Niger, and the vice president of Sudan attended the conference and were influential in mediating the peace.  Chad's crisis and the second Chad/Libya international crisis as a whole ended on 27 March 1978, following a second Sebha Conference and a comprehensive agreement announced in Benghazi that day. Under the Benghazi Accords, Chad agreed to recognize FROLINAT. Both agreed to abide by the cease-fire; to allow free movement throughout Chad; and to assist a Libya-Niger military committee in implementing the Accords. Most important, Chad agreed to the termination of foreign (French) military bases and military presence in Chad. However, the Benghazi Accords were short lived, and other Chad/Libya crises were soon to erupt.  The two superpowers, as well as the UN and the OAU, were not involved in this crisis.
An Israeli retaliatory invasion caused a crisis for Lebanon from 14 March to 13 June 1978. PLO bases in Lebanon, supplied with Soviet weapons, had long been in operation as training camps for Palestinian guerrillas making frequent, mostly unsuccessful, incursions into Israeli territory. On 11 March 1978 11 Palestinians entered Israel by sea and attacked vehicles on the main highway 11 kilometers north of Tel Aviv. Thirty-five Israelis were killed and another 70 wounded before Israeli police, in a fierce clash, killed or captured all of the terrorists. Israeli troops, supported by the air force, crossed into southern Lebanon in a major attack against PLO bases, triggering a crisis for Lebanon on 14 March 1978. On the 17th Lebanon requested the Security Council to discuss the Israeli invasion. The Council met on the 19th and called for Israel's immediate withdrawal, along with the placement of a UN peacekeeping force in the area occupied by Israel. Lebanon's foreign minister met with ambassadors in Beirut to explain Lebanon's position. The hostilities ended at the end of March, but Israeli forces remained in Lebanon until 13 June 1978 when the last stage of the withdrawal was carried out. This terminated the crisis for Lebanon.  The Soviet Union and the United States were involved politically. Vice President Mondale acknowledged Israel's right to defend its borders against terrorist incursions but called for an Israeli withdrawal. The United States supported the Security Council resolution. The Soviet Union condemned the Israeli invasion and abstained in the Council vote. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established in 1978, remained in southern Lebanon through the Lebanon War of 1982 and for years thereafter.
France, Libya, and Chad were the crisis actors in the third eruption during the protracted Chad/Libya conflict from 15 April to 29 August 1978. The Benghazi Accords of 27 March 1978 provided a brief respite in the ongoing struggle between President Malloum's regime and the Libya-backed rebels led by Goukouni Oueddei for control over the territory and government of Chad. The cease-fire, authorized by the Benghazi Accords to take effect on 10 April, broke down almost at once. On 15 April FROLINAT forces, led by Goukouni Oueddei, seized Salal and advanced south to within 100 miles of Chad's capital, N'Djamena. This created a crisis for France by threatening its continued influence in equatorial Africa generally and, in particular, its secure access to the uranium resources of neighboring Niger, vital for France's force de frappe. France, which, since 1960, had assumed a proprietary right to protect former French colonies--and French interests--in Africa against external threats, responded on the 26th to an appeal by Malloum with an airlift of 1,700 troops, a heavy bombardment of rebel convoys, and the creation of a defense perimeter around the capital, thereby preventing the fall of Malloum's regime.  French intervention in April-May 1978 and its success in halting Goukouni's advance was perceived by Libya in mid-May as a serious threat to its hegemony in Chad. Qaddhafi responded on 22 June with an invasion by 800 Libyan troops, who overran several provinces in northern and central Chad. Libya's escalation of hostilities, in turn, created a crisis for Chad. President Malloum responded on 20 July with an appeal to the OAU to denounce Libya's intervention and to press for the withdrawal of Libya's forces from Chad's territory.  While an OAU commission was investigating Chad's charges, France and Libya concluded a secret agreement in late July 1978 providing for a de facto partition of Chad at the 16th Parallel into two spheres of influence. The formation of a virtual condominium over Chad ended the crisis for these two actors. Chad's crisis ended on 29 August, when an agreement was reached in Khartoum creating a National Unity Government, with Habré as Prime Minister and Malloum continuing as President and their military forces formally integrated.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
Fighting between South African forces and guerrillas based in Angola led to a crisis for South Africa and Angola from 3 to 17 May 1978. For much of the period since the SWAPO guerrilla war against the SADF stationed in Namibia began in 1966, its raids had been carried out from neighboring states. Since its civil war in 1975-76 (see Case #260--War in Angola), Angola had become the main staging area for SWAPO raids. In the early months of 1978 there was an intensification of SWAPO activity. SADF losses were reported in periodic clashes in the northern Namibian border region. In February 1978 Angola complained to the UN Secretary-General of South African violations of its territory and airspace. A SWAPO attack on the Ruacana hydroelectric power station in Namibia's border area with Angola on 3 May triggered a crisis for South Africa. The South African foreign minister and the army chief of operations reported that a raid of approximately 700 South African troops into Angola, on 4 May, was a response to the upsurge of guerrilla activity and the SWAPO raid the day before. That act catalyzed a crisis for Angola.  Angolan sources stated that the SADF occupied the town of Cassinga, 230 kilometers north of the border, which South Africa claimed to be SWAPO's main operational base. The town of Chetequera was also attacked. South Africa's raid was the largest since 1975-76, when its forces were involved on the side of UNITA in the Angolan civil war. In the operations at Cassinga, which lasted for 12 hours, six South African soldiers and about 1,000 refugees were reportedly killed. In addition to ground forces, aircraft were alleged to have been involved.  Angolan troops met the attacking forces. On 5 May Angola appealed to the United Nations for support. The following day a resolution was passed by the Security Council unanimously condemning South Africa and warning that "more effective measures might be taken." With the resolution, and the end of the raid, the crisis ended for Angola on 6 May. The ambassadors of Canada, France, the U.K., the U.S., and West Germany in South Africa formed a committee, known as the Contact Group, to investigate and propose solutions to the problem. On 17 May, for the first time since the raid, the South African foreign minister met with the Contact Group. This meeting, signaling a major reduction in stress, ended the crisis over Cassinga for South Africa.  U.S. activity was confined to the political realm. On 6 May the United States expressed grave concern and urgently requested that South Africa explain its behavior. The U.S. also participated in the Contact Group. The USSR was a major supplier of arms to Angola through Cuba, as well as arms and advisors to SWAPO. The OAU condemned South Africa on 9 May 1978 and called for the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia.
A second invasion of Shaba from Angola created a crisis for Zaire, Angola, Belgium, France, and the U.S. from 11 May to 30 July 1978. After a year of reorganizing and strengthening their forces, Katangan rebels invaded Shaba on 11 May 1978, triggering a crisis for Zaire. Zaire accused Angola of harboring the rebels and threatened to retaliate, triggering a crisis for Angola the same day. During the ensuing four days killings occurred on the part of both the rebels and the Zairian army. President Mobutu called for intervention by Belgium, France, Morocco, China, and the U.S. in order to quell the insurgents. In addition, he accused the governments of Algeria, Angola, Cuba, Libya, the Soviet Union, and Zambia of supporting, training, and actively fighting alongside the rebels.  On 14 May a crisis was triggered for Belgium, France, and the U.S. when their governments were informed of a massacre of French and Belgian citizens working in the mines, and of the danger facing the white community in Zaire. The U.S. viewed the events in Zaire as threatening its influence in the international system. On 16 May it responded with a decision to mount an airlift to carry foreign troops to the battleground. The French response, on 17 May, was a decision by President Giscard d'Estaing, together with the foreign and defense ministers and the chief of staff, to dispatch French troops to Zaire. Belgium, too, decided on the 18th to send troops. The foreign troops arrived in Zaire on the 19th, airlifted in American planes. That day, at the UN, Zaire accused Angola of aggression. However, the issue was not brought up for discussion in the Security Council since it was claimed that the dispute was an African matter.  The tide of battle turned with the intervention of foreign forces. Within two days Belgian troops had evacuated those persons who wished to leave the Shaba area. On 22 May the crisis ended for the United States and Belgium as Belgian forces began to withdraw from Shaba. French troops assumed a larger burden of the fighting. They occupied the towns around Kolwezi and cleared the area on 25 May, terminating the crisis for France. An African force, consisting of soldiers from Morocco, Senegal, and Zaire, took over from the French and the Belgian forces on 4 June. On the l0th Angola's major response to the crisis took the form of an announcement by President Neto that the incursion by FLNC rebels across Angola's border would be halted and that any Zairian troops crossing the border into Angola would be disarmed. Angola also denied any Soviet involvement in the invasion. By the end of June all foreign troops had left the conflict area.  Throughout July, a number of mediation attempts occurred, involving Deputy U.S. Representative to the UN Donald McHenry and Presiden Yhombi Opango of the Congo. McHenry had arrived in Angola on 28 June with the dual strategy of negotiating a rapprochement between Angola and Zaire and pressing for Namibian independence (related to the concurrent crisis 291). McHenry arranged for a series of talks between Zaire and Angola that opened in Brazzaville on 15 July under the chairmanship of Opango. The opening round of talks was one of rapprochement between the two combatants. A second round of talks occurred under the mediation of Opango and McHenry from 21-22 July, and a final round took place from 20-30 July. In the final round, Mobutu and Neto reached the Brazzaville Agreement on 30 July, which terminated the crisis for both sides. Zaire vowed to end border incursions and halt all aid to UNITA, FLEC and the FNLA, while Angola similarly pledged to disarm the FLNC and reopen the Benguela railroad to facilitate Zaire copper shipment for Atlantic export. Moreover, the two leaders promised to repatriate 500,000 Zairian and Angolan refugees and prisoners.
The shooting down of a Rhodesian civilian plane precipitated a crisis for Rhodesia and Zambia from 3 September to 31 October 1978. On 3 September 1978 an Air Rhodesia Viscount civilian plane was shot down unexpectedly by ZAPU (Zimbabwe African Peoples Union) guerrillas near Kariba, in Rhodesia's border area with Zambia, triggering a crisis for Rhodesia. Ten survivors were reportedly murdered on the ground after the plane had crashed. The plane was shot down by a heat-seeking SAM-7 missile, the first time such advanced weaponry had been used in the war over Rhodesia. Zambia, anticipating Rhodesian retaliation, appealed to the U.K. to restrain Rhodesia. The U.S. and Britain urged Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia not to retaliate. The UN Secretary-General condemned the guerrilla attack. Within Rhodesia, the incident had caused great indignation. Smith announced on 10 September that martial law legislation would be introduced. Four days later Smith rejected the inclusion of ZAPU leader Nkomo in any internal settlement and objected to British and American support for the Zimbabwean guerrillas. Zambia complied with a Rhodesian demand to ground all civil aviation.  Smith visited the U.S. on 7 October. On the l0th all racial discrimination in Rhodesia was formally abolished. The same day the Security Council passed a resolution, at India's initiative, condemning the U.S. for allowing Smith's visit. On 19 October Rhodesia launched a major offensive against targets in Zambia, triggering a crisis for the latter. The raid was mainly against ZAPU bases, and 300 followers of Nkomo were reportedly killed. Zambia responded with military resistance: minor clashes ensued. President Kaunda declared on 23 October that his country was militarily weaker than Rhodesia and was unable to fight back. Kaunda also had 18 foreigners arrested on suspicion of aiding Rhodesia. Kaunda's statement of weakness ended Zambia's crisis. Rhodesia's crisis ended on 31 October with an extension of martial law to half the country. The crisis ended with no change in the status quo.  The USSR was not involved, the U.S. marginally so.
An international crisis over the civil war in Nicaragua involved Costa Rica and Nicaragua from 10 September 1978 to 17 July 1979. During 1978 there was severe unrest in Nicaragua, with widespread demonstrations and strikes in opposition to President Somoza's dictatorial regime. On 22 August the National Palace was temporarily seized by left-wing guerrillas of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (SNLF), who were supported by Costa Rica. The internal situation worsened in early September when regime repression increased, and the Sandinistas called for a national insurrection against Somoza. On the 9th heavy fighting broke out between the Nicaraguan National Guard and Sandinista supporters. A foreign policy crisis for Nicaragua was triggered on 10 September 1978 by a guerrilla attack from Costa Rica at the border town of Penas Blancas. According to Somoza, the 300-man invasion force was part of a plan to overthrow his regime, with the complicity of the Costa Rican government, President Cararo, and other high officials. Nicaragua responded the same day with a counterattack and the reorganization of the National Guard to meet attacks throughout the country. The following day Somoza declared a partial state of siege.  A crisis for Costa Rica was triggered on 12 September by Nicaraguan bombing of its territory and "hot pursuit" by Nicaraguan forces across the border. The following day the state of siege was extended throughout Nicaragua. The Costa Rican response to the crisis was the signing of a mutual aid and cooperation agreement with Venezuela on 15 September, a day after the latter had sent four jet bombers to Costa Rica on a goodwill visit. Costa Rica had no official army; its defense was handled by a Civil Guard. Panama, too, sent arms to Costa Rica. On 16 September Nicaragua recalled its ambassadors from Costa Rica, Panama, and Venezuela, and, later, from Colombia.  On 18 September the Permanent Council of the OAS accepted a proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers to consider the situation in Nicaragua. At meetings that took place in Washington between 21 and 23 September, a resolution was passed affirming the principle of nonintervention and reaffirming Nicaraguan sovereignty over its internal affairs; and a decision was reached to send an investigation team to Nicaragua. A statement by the United States Department of State expressed concern at reported atrocities committed by the Nicaraguan National Guard. On 25 September the insurgents were defeated and factories and businesses reopened in Nicaragua, terminating its first crisis. On that day, too, Somoza announced that Nicaragua would accept U.S. mediation.  On 29 September Nicaragua's president agreed to a mediation team sponsored by the OAS, the mediating countries being the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and the United States. Its first meeting was held on 16 October. However, by mid-January 1979 mediation efforts collapsed. And on 8 February the U.S. ended all military aid to Nicaragua.  Following clashes between Costa Rican Civil Guards and Nicaraguan National Guards on 21 November 1978, Costa Rica severed diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and began a call-up of 2,500 troops. A resolution was passed by the UN General Assembly on 15 December condemning Nicaragua for repressing its population and demanding that Nicaragua cease all acts endangering the security of its neighbors. UN activity made it difficult for Somoza to contend that his government was a victim of foreign communist aggression; and his regime became isolated. On the 27th Somoza threatened to invade Costa Rica if that country continued to assist the guerrillas. On 30 December Somoza met with the presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, all of whom had been supporting him in the fight against the Sandinistas.  Sporadic fighting continued until 27 May 1979, when a second crisis was triggered for Nicaragua by an invasion of guerrillas from Costa Rica. Nicaragua responded the same day by repelling the invaders. The U.S. continued to refuse to sell arms to Nicaragua and, according to Somoza, convinced Israel to impose an arms embargo as well.  At the end of May Nicaragua called upon the Permanent Council of the OAS to invoke the Rio Treaty in response to the Costa Rican invasion. Costa Rica requested the same OAS action against Nicaragua on 3 June. The following day the OAS Council met and passed a resolution calling for the replacement of President Somoza's dictatorship by a democratic regime. A U.S. proposal to dispatch a peacekeeping force to Nicaragua was rejected by the OAS. Despite the embargo, U.S. military equipment found its way into the conflict zone. Heavy fighting continued throughout June. Toward mid-July the OAS agreed to a proposal whereby General Somoza would resign, a cease-fire would take place, and the left-wing revolutionary junta would assume power in Nicaragua. No agreement was reached between Somoza's government and the Sandinistas. The president fled Nicaragua on 17 July 1979, ending the crisis for Costa Rica and Nicaragua.  (The Sandinistas, in coalition with liberal democrats, assumed power in Nicaragua. During the Carter administration a $75 million loan was granted to Nicaragua, but the final payment was withheld by President Reagan in January 1981, when relations between the two countries deteriorated: the State Department charged that the Sandinista government was aiding guerrillas in El Salvador; Managua denied the charges.)
A second crisis for Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel lasted from 16 October 1978 to 8 January 1979. The first crisis over the Beagle Channel ended in February 1978 with a moratorium of 180 days in an attempt to settle the dispute (see Case #287). During that period six rounds of negotiations took place, with little progress. Soon after, Argentina began overt military preparations. On 16 October a crisis for Chile was triggered by Argentina's call-up of 50,000 reservists. Tank and troop movements, with minor clashes, were later reported near the Chilean border. Chile responded on the 24th by sending troops to the border and canceling naval maneuvers with the U.S. and Peru, due to take place 1,500 miles north of Chile, in the event that Argentina might try to occupy the disputed islands in the Beagle Channel.  On the day of the deadline, 2 November, the two states announced that they had reached an agreement on joint economic development of the Beagle region, but that the distribution of the maritime zones had still not been resolved. Chile's Foreign Minister, Herman Cubillos Sallato, proposed mediation by a friendly government. Argentina agreed on the 8th. On 11 December Sallato met with Argentina's Foreign Minister, Carlos Washington Paston, to designate a mediator, and they chose Pope John Paul II. but the talks collapsed after Chile rejected an Argentinian plan.  On 16 December a crisis for Argentina was triggered when Chile put 45,000 troops on full alert. It responded on the 21st with a complaint to the UN Security Council that Chile was creating a military imbalance in the disputed area by illegally deploying troops and artillery. The same day Chile asked for an urgent meeting of the OAS to prevent Argentina from attacking the islands; and the Pope announced that he would act as mediator. The offer was accepted by both states. On the 26th Cardinal Sumore arrived in Buenos Aires to start a mediation mission. The Pope’s mediation efforts contributed significantly to a reduction of tension and a decreased willingness to resort to violence as a means of crisis management. The crisis ended for both actors with the signing of the Declaration of Montevideo on 8 January 1979, in which the two parties accepted the Pope's mediation and committed themselves not to use force in their relations with one another.  The Security Council discussed the problem but did not pass a resolution. On 10 November 1978 the United States called on the OAS to offer its services to the parties in order to avoid a violent conflict; but it did not become more deeply involved in the crisis despite U.S. and Chilean requests.  (The issue remained unresolved until 1984 when a Vatican-mediated treaty was signed by Argentina and Chile. The accord granted Chile sovereignty over the islands but limited its maritime rights to the Pacific waters, while Argentina won control of the waters on the Atlantic side of the Beagle Channel.)  There was no USSR involvement in this crisis.
Tanzania, Uganda, and Libya were the actors in a crisis from 30 October 1978 to 10 April 1979 leading to the fall of Uganda's President Idi Amin. In 1971 General Idi Amin seized power in Uganda in a coup that overthrew the regime of President Milton Obote, who then took refuge in Tanzania. From that time onward relations between the two countries were hostile as Amin perceived President Nyerere of Tanzania as supporting a military overthrow of his regime. Crises between the two countries occurred in 1971 and 1972 (see Cases #245, #247). During the years that followed no overt clashes occurred, but there were mutual accusations of troop movements. In October 1978 serious mutinies erupted in various Ugandan army barracks near the Tanzanian border. The mutineers were reported to have fled into Tanzania. On 30 October Ugandan troops invaded Tanzania and occupied the Kagera Salient, triggering a crisis for Tanzania. Idi Amin announced that he had annexed the area north of the Kagera River. A large Ugandan force followed the invading troops. Tanzania's resistance in the Salient on 31 October triggered a crisis for Uganda, but the Tanzanian major response was a counteroffensive launched on 11 November. Uganda responded on the 13th by withdrawing its forces from the Kagera Salient. By late November President Nyerere made it known that Tanzania would not be satisfied until Amin was overthrown. Sporadic fighting continued until the end of January 1979 as Tanzanian forces pushed across the Ugandan border. As they began to advance northward into Uganda, the tense border situation exploded in a series of violent exchanges.  By mid-February the Tanzanian advance had come within 150 kilometers of Kampala. At that stage, Libya, an ally of Amin's Uganda, renewed its mediatory efforts, with little success. As Amin's position became more vulnerable, the Ugandan leader appealed to "all friendly countries" to come to his rescue with troops and military equipment. On 25 February the government of Libya perceived the possible downfall of Amin as a threat to its influence in the region. It responded to this crisis on 4 March by sending troops to Kampala to join an earlier contingent that had arrived in Entebbe, together with supplies, in mid-February.  Despite the new equipment and foreign reinforcements, Uganda suffered defeat after defeat until, by 25 March, Tanzanian artillery was firing on Kampala and Entebbe. On 6 April Tanzanian and anti-Amin Ugandan forces moved to the outskirts of Kampala; and, on the following day, they captured Entebbe. On 9 April it was reported that Libya paid the Ugandan National Liberation Forces (UNLF, the combined exiled anti-Amin forces) the equivalent of $20 million to allow Libya's expeditionary force to pull out of Uganda without being attacked.  The crisis ended for Libya in defeat. The following day Amin fled from the capital, and the crisis ended for Uganda and Tanzania.  Amin's appeals to the OAU, the Arab League, and the UN, on 4 November 1978, to force the Tanzanians to stop fighting had failed, as did the mediation attempts by Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia. Discussions in an OAU ad hoc committee on interstate conflicts were also fruitless. On 25 February envoys from the committee visited the presidents in their capitals in hopes of resolving the crisis. Tanzania had demanded that the OAU condemn Ugandan aggression, but a seven-point plan that the committee presented did not contain such a resolution, and Tanzania summarily rejected it. On 2 March 1979 the OAU admitted that its efforts to reach a cease-fire had failed. UN Secretary-General Waldheim appealed to Tanzania and Uganda to stop fighting and offered his good offices to seek a solution.  United States involvement was political: on 6 March 1979 the State Department accused Libya of direct military involvement; this followed a statement by Secretary of State Vance calling for the withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the Kagera Salient at the onset of the crisis. A Pravda statement on 12 November 1978 accused Tanzania of aggression: the USSR had been a supplier of weapons and advisors to Amin's Uganda prior to the crisis, but there was no increase in this activity during the crisis. In March 1979 the Soviet Union reportedly withdrew advisors and military supplies from Uganda.
A South African troop buildup precipitated a crisis for Angola from 7 to 14 November 1978. In May 1978 South Africa invaded Angola after a guerrilla attack on the Ruacana hydroelectric power station in Namibia (see Case #291--Cassinga Incident). On 22 October Angolan, SWAPO, Cuban, and East German forces launched a major offensive against UNITA in the southern and central parts of Angola On 7 November 1978 Angola's minister of defense stated that intelligence reports had reached him of a major buildup of South African forces along the border with Namibia; further, that South Africa planned a large incursion into Angola. The same day Angola responded with a general mobilization of the Angolan army (about 200,000 men) and a curfew in the five largest urban centers. On 8 November the SADF command issued a statement denying any intention of invading Angola. But on the l0th a bomb explosion in Angola's second largest city, Muambo, gave rise to the fear of an imminent South African attack. The next day Angola's President Neto accused South Africa of fighting an undeclared war against Angola and closed its airspace to South African overflights.  South African statements claimed that Angola's perception of war was the result of UNITA successes in the 22 October campaign and that Angola wished to detract attention from its domestic problems. The crisis ended with a statement on 14 November by South Africa's Prime Minister Botha, denying any intention to invade Angola.  UN activity took the form of an appeal by the UN Special Committee on Apartheid to all governments on 14 November to help Angola repel South African "aggression." Angola accused the Security Council of ineffective measures to stop the threat of invasion.  There was no U.S. or USSR involvement in this crisis.
A crisis between China (PRC) and Vietnam, which escalated to full-scale war, lasted from 25 December 1978 to 15 March 1979. China and Vietnam were hostile neighbors for a thousand years. Most of what later became North and South Vietnam--Cochin China (from 1862) and Annam (from 1874)--was controlled by France through the first half of the twentieth century. Although Vietnam declared its independence in September 1945, French domination ended only after its defeat at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954 and the Geneva Agreement on Indochina soon after (see Case #145, in Indochina PC). From that point onward there were several incidents and disputes between China and Vietnam including armed conflict over the Paracel Islands in 1959 and 1974. Tension between China and Vietnam mounted in the summer of 1978. On 29 June Vietnam joined the Soviet bloc's economic community, COMECON. On 12 July China tightened border controls in order to stem the influx of refugees, which had reached 169,000 of the Hoa people fleeing Vietnam to China. Moreover, a significant military buildup occurred along the Sino/Vietnam border. The two countries edged toward full-scale war during the summer of 1978, while fighting continued during the autumn, followed by a break during the rainy season. In November Vietnam and the USSR signed a Treaty of Friendship, which pledged Soviet assistance in the event of an attack. And in December the continued drain on Vietnam's resources led to its decisive Invasion of Cambodia (see Case #284, in Indochina PC). Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia on 25 December 1978 triggered a crisis for China. Its response was a military incursion into Vietnam on 17 February and the occupation of several border villages. This, in turn, triggered a crisis for Vietnam.  Chinese troops met with stronger than anticipated opposition leading to a halt in military operations. They were resumed on the 23rd, after the invasion force had been enlarged to 200,000. Vietnam responded by launching two counterattacks into Chinese territory the same day. Fighting subsided on 5 March. A PRC government statement that day announced that the Chinese troops had attained their goal--"to punish the Vietnamese aggressor"--and would withdraw to Chinese territory; but the image of China's military embarrassment persisted. The same day the government of Vietnam issued a decree proclaiming general mobilization. Chinese troops were withdrawn from Vietnam by 15 March 1979 terminating the crisis for the PRC and Vietnam.  On 17 February, the day of the Chinese incursion, Vietnam urged the UN Secretary-General to take appropriate measures to put an end to China's "aggression" but did not request a formal session of the Security Council. On the 22nd the U.S., the U.K., Norway, and Portugal requested an urgent meeting of the Council to consider the situation in Southeast Asia. The five ASEAN countries (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) circulated a draft resolution calling for a halt to all hostilities in Indochina; but, as with the proposed resolution on Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, it was vetoed by the Soviets.  China's exercise in deterrence had mixed results: it was revealed as unable to prevent the toppling of a regime (in Cambodia) to whose support it was publicly committed; and it failed "to punish" Vietnam. At the same time China emerged in a stronger political position because the USSR abstained from participation in the war. And there was no apparent damage to the normalization of U.S./PRC relations, which had been strengthened in December 1978.
A Polisario attack on the Moroccan town of Tan Tan triggered a crisis for Morocco on 28 January 1979. The crisis faded in March of that year. On 10 July 1978 the government of Mauritania, under President Mokhtar Ould Daddah, was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mustapha Ould Mohammed Salek. Polisario immediately announced a unilateral cease-fire in Mauritania and entered into peace talks with that country. Concentration of activities by Polisario then moved against Moroccan troops stationed in the northern section of the disputed territory.  By the fall of 1978 Polisario raids began to creep closer to southern Morocco, and in September a group of guerrillas carried out a spectacular raid 70 kilometers into Moroccan territory. Morocco appealed to the UN, without success. On 27 December Algerian President Houari Boumedienne died. He had been viewed by Polisario as one of its main sponsors and supporters and a source of political, military, and ideological strength. His death gave rise to a series of Polisario offensives that were termed "Houari Boumedienne Attacks." In December alone, Morocco reportedly lost 600 troops.  Mauritania's involvement in the Saharan conflict had resulted in serious economic difficulties. With the overthrow of President Ould Daddah, Mauritania began to pull out of the Western Sahara conflict in 1979. On 1 January 1979 Colonel Salek of Mauritania spoke of his support for the right of self-determination for all peoples. Shortly thereafter he announced that he had asked Morocco to withdraw all its forces from Mauritania by March 1979. More serious Polisario attacks in Morocco occurred on 16 and 17 January 1979. On 28 January Polisario forces attacked Tan Tan, a garrison town, air force base, and convoy assembly point 40 kilometers inside Moroccan territory. Fighting continued for three days as the Moroccan forces in the area resisted and ultimately succeeded in defeating the invaders. King Hassan sent his top military advisor to the area and summoned other military officers to a meeting in Marrakesh. On 2 February Morocco's Foreign Minister, Boucetta, stated, in a message to his Algerian counterpart, Bouteflika, that Morocco did not intend to exercise its "right of pursuit." Morocco's major response, on 8 March, was an announcement by King Hassan that he had decided to establish a Defense Council, comprising two members of each political organization or party, to deal with the Saharan situation which, he said, had reached the "limit of the intolerable." The Moroccan Chamber of Representatives approved the king's decision and adopted a declaration that recommended that the government exercise its right of pursuit and mount retaliatory operations whenever Moroccan territory was the object of military aggression.  The crisis faded sometime in March, with a temporary halt in Polisario activities.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
Rhodesian raids on guerrilla bases in Angola and Zambia occurred during a crisis for these three states from 12 February to 31 May 1979. The transitional Rhodesian government established in April 1978 made little progress toward reaching an understanding with the Patriotic Front, with no cease-fire in sight. By the beginning of 1979 Rhodesia's security forces reportedly totaled 50,000, including a 10,000-man army. In February 1979 guerrilla attacks on power and transport installations in Rhodesia increased. On 12 February 1979 another Air Rhodesia Viscount, on a flight from Kariba to Salisbury, was shot down by a SAM-7 missile, and all 59 passengers and crew were killed (see Case #293). In response to the downing of the plane by guerrillas in Zambia, Rhodesian forces attacked Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) bases in Zambia on 23 February. Three days later seven Rhodesian planes bombed a ZIPRA base near Luso in Angola, marking a new phase in the Rhodesian war, with Angolan territory now a target for Rhodesian raids. The attack triggered a crisis for Angola, which responded the following day with a strongly worded statement condemning Rhodesia, as well as South Africa. (The latter was thought to have provided Mirage planes for the attack.) March 1979 was marked by repeated skirmishes on all fronts.  On 13 April Rhodesian commandos again attacked guerrilla bases in Zambia, including ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo's house in Lusaka, as well as other targets in the city and countryside. This triggered a crisis for Zambia, which responded on the 16th with a declaration by President Kaunda of a curfew on parts of the country close to the national railway line. On the 22nd Kaunda announced that Zambia would be receiving new weaponry.  On 10 May 1979 Angola's President Neto met with Kaunda and concluded an agreement declaring that an attack on either party would be considered an attack on both. A Joint Security Force was to be set up to repel Rhodesian or South African incursions into their territories. This pact marked the termination of Angola's crisis, while Zambia's crisis ended two days later with the lifting of the curfew that had been imposed on 16 April. The crisis ended for Rhodesia on 31 May with the change of government: that day Ian Smith handed over the reins of government to Bishop Abel Muzorewa.  The UN Security Council met on 8 March 1979 to discuss the strengthening of sanctions against Rhodesia, while condemning the forthcoming Rhodesian elections as insufficient in the provision for black representation in government.  The Ministerial Council of the OAU met between 1 and 3 March and adopted a resolution condemning Rhodesia. The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this case.
War between North and South Yemen triggered a crisis for both from 24 February to 30 March 1979. In the years following their 1972 crisis, relations between the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) in the north and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) in the south oscillated between statements of friendship and calls for unity, and expressions of hostility and border clashes. After the assassination of the YAR's president in June 1978 there was a sharp rise in tension between the two states, and relations with the PDRY were severed. In the following month, both heads of state were killed within days of each other. Accusations and counteraccusations of murder and penetration across each other's border followed. Despite PLO leader Yasser Arafat's attempt at mediation in September, serious border incidents continued, with both sides massing troops along the frontier. In December the YAR sent troops to restore control over some villages on the border. Localized clashes escalated into open hostility as the YAR charged the PDRY with training saboteurs, harboring foreign troops from Cuba, Ethiopia, and the USSR, and having aggressive designs. The PDRY rejected these accusations, claiming the YAR had made open declarations of war. Renewed attempts by Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, and the PLO to ease the tension and stop border clashes were made during the first half of February 1979. On 24 February 1979 North Yemen (the YAR) informed the U.S. ambassador that South Yemen (the PDRY) had launched a three-pronged attack across the border, with Soviet assistance, while the latter maintained it was successfully repulsing an attack launched by North Yemeni forces and had penetrated into the YAR capturing border towns. North Yemen called for an emergency meeting of the League of Arab States (LAS) to discuss South Yemen's "aggression" and appealed to the United States for arms.  Sa'udi Arabia placed its armed forces on a state of alert on the 28th. The Sa'udis, while remaining a staunch ally and supporter of North Yemen, also wished to improve their relations with the PDRY and sought to preserve the military balance in the area.  That day, too, the U.S. announced a speedup of delivery of Sa'udi-financed U.S. arms to North Yemen. This move reflected, at least in part, the profound impact of the Iranian revolution and a fear that Yemen would be the next target in a Soviet plan to dominate the region. The USSR was the main supplier of arms and weapons, directly, or indirectly through Cuba, to South Yemen.  On 2 March mediation efforts by the LAS – specifically involving Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Kuwait – succeeded in bringing about an agreement on a cease-fire to begin the next day. Nevertheless, fighting continued for two weeks after the 3 March agreement. On the 5th the LAS adopted a resolution calling for a cease-fire and agreed to form a follow-up committee to supervise its implementation and work toward normalizing relations between the two adversaries. A meeting in San'a between the chiefs of staff of both Yemens on 16 March resulted in a second cease-fire agreement. The withdrawal of YAR and PDRY troops began on the 18th and was completed the next day. The presidents of both states arrived in Kuwait on the 28th, and, under the auspices of Kuwaiti mediation, on the 30th they announced a provisional agreement to unite their countries, thereby terminating the crisis. (With the beginning of the unity talks after the Kuwait summit, a new atmosphere prevailed--both Yemens abstained from public accusations, and propaganda ceased immediately.)  The UN remained aloof during this crisis.  (The two Yemens united in 1990. In 1994, a full-scale war erupted between the two former independent states of (North) Yemen and South Yemen: the latter tried to secede but was not successful. It was in substance, though not in form, an international crisis in the still unresolved conflict between long-standing Yemeni adversaries.)
South African raids on SWAPO bases in Angola caused a crisis for Angola from 6 to 28 March 1979. SWAPO had carried on guerrilla warfare against South African troops in South-West Africa since 1966. In 1978 activity was intensified, and a crisis occurred from 3 to 17 May (see Case #291--Cassinga Incident). In November of that year Angola perceived the possibility of a South African invasion (see Case #297--Angola Invasion Scare). Guerrilla activity against South Africa reached its highest intensity in January 1979. On 6 March air and ground attacks by the SADF on SWAPO targets in southern Angola triggered a crisis for Angola. The attacks lasted until the 15th, the targets being mainly arms dumps and supplies. Some villages were attacked as well, and minor clashes were reported. Angola accused South Africa of using napalm, but there was no verification of this claim. On 16 March Angola approached the United Nations for help. The Security Council met between 20 and 28 March and passed a resolution on the 28th: it condemned South Africa and demanded an immediate end to provocative acts; it also called for "aid to strengthen the defensive capabilities" of Angola. The resolution ended the crisis for Angola's decision makers.  The United States abstained from the Security Council vote. The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (Following the crisis, in April, President Neto announced to the Angolan people that he planned to increase the size of the armed forces. In October 1979 South African troops invaded Angola once more [see Case #308].)
The Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United States were enmeshed in a lengthy international crisis marking the onset of the prolonged war over Afghanistan (1979-91). The crisis lasted from mid-March 1979 until 28 February 1980. Two crucial events preceded the Afghanistan Invasion crisis and war. The last King of Afghanistan, Mohammad Zahir, was overthrown in a coup on 17 July 1973; and a republic was proclaimed by his first cousin and brother-in-law, Mohammad Daoud Khan, who had served as Prime Minister from 1953 to 1963. Daoud, in turn, along with 30 family members, was killed in a left-wing coup on 27 April 1978. This marked the end of the Mohammadzai lineage of the Durrani Pushtun, which had ruled Afghanistan for 150 years.  A revolutionary council took power in the new Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (the DRA), with three leaders representing competing factions on the left of the Afghan political system: Mohammad Taraki, leader of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), as President; Babrak Karmal as Vice-President; and Hafizullah Amin as Deputy Prime Minister.  From the outset the new left-wing rulers of Afghanistan relied upon the Soviet Union for funds to cover the payroll of civil servants, and for a commitment to support the new regime during a critical period in the modern history of Afghanistan. Because its coup lacked legitimacy within Afghanistan, the new ruling party, the PDPA, faced open rebellion during the subsequent months from a welter of antigovernment forces dominated by Muslim fundamentalists, later known as the Mujahuddin. The most serious challenge was the Herat Uprising in mid-March 1979. It was so serious that the PDPA Politburo turned to Moscow for assistance to ensure its survival. A crisis for the USSR was triggered by the Heart Uprising and by the PDPA appeal for urgent aid in mid-March 1979. Moscow decided at once to take whatever steps were deemed necessary to keep the Communists in power in Kabul. Operationally, the Soviets began a large-scale airlift to the PDPA regime on 26-27 March: cargo planes, light tanks, armored personnel carriers, and helicopter gun ships. General Yepishev was sent to Kabul on 5 April; and Pravda articles began to blame the U.S., Pakistan, China, and Egypt for provoking and backing the Afghan rebels.  Within the PDPA, Taraki was replaced by Amin as the dominant figure after the Heart Uprising. However, an article in Pravda in mid-July clearly indicated that the Soviets were seeking a replacement for Amin. This triggered a crisis for Afghanistan. Amin then embarked on a hundred bloody days of repression to save his own position. Moscow, increasingly concerned about the ability of its client regime to survive, made the critical decision to invade Afghanistan, on 27 November 1979. Implementation began on 24 December, when troops of the 105th airborne division began to land at Kabul airport.  By 27 December Amin was dead. He was succeeded by the most loyal pro-Soviet Afghan leader, Babrak Karmal, long-time head of one of the two dominant PDPA factions, the Parcham (Flag) Group, formed by him in 1967 against the then-dominant Khalq Group. The two groups had renewed their cooperation in July 1977 to oppose the Daoud regime. But factional rivalry broke out again soon after the overthrow of Daoud and remained a constant until the collapse of the PDPA regime amid the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1991. The installation of Karmal as leader of Afghanistan marked the end of the USSR's and Afghanistan's initial crisis--but not the international crisis as a whole or the Afghan War; from that time on, until 1991, Afghanistan under Babrak Karmal was an appendage of the USSR in the Afghan War.  For both Pakistan and the U.S. a crisis was triggered by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on 24 December. An emergency meeting of the U.S.'s National Security Council was convened to cope with what President Carter termed the most serious superpower crisis of his presidency. The U.S. response took the form of a series of measures announced on 2 January 1980. The U.S. blocked the export of 17 million tons of grain to the Soviet Union, then facing a severe food shortage; stopped the sale of computers and other high tech equipment to the USSR; reduced the permissible catch by the Soviet fishing fleet in U.S. waters from 350,000 tons to 75,000 tons; delayed the opening of a Soviet consulate in New York; postponed the renegotiation of a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union, then under consideration; boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980; reassured the Pakistanis of U.S. security support; and visibly increased U.S./ China cooperation, including the sale of military equipment to Beijing.  That U.S. response also marks the beginning of the winding down of its Afghanistan Invasion crisis. The main reason was that, at the end of 1979, the U.S. administration and public opinion became preoccupied with the hostage crisis in Iran (see Case #309--U.S. Hostages in Iran, in Middle East: Non-PCs). Termination of the U.S.'s Afghanistan crisis is identified with a decision on 28 February 1980 to pursue a two-track policy: return to normal relations with the USSR; and continue a steady flow of arms aid, via Pakistan, to the many groups of anti-Soviet Afghan guerrillas until the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.  Pakistan's generals perceived the Soviet invasion as a graver threat than did the U.S., namely, the distinct possibility that the Soviets would invade Pakistan as well. For that reason and because of its geographic proximity to the USSR they responded much more cautiously than the U.S.: on 29 December 1979 Pakistan delivered a strongly worded message to Moscow condemning the invasion and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet forces. At that early stage, however, Pakistan took no concrete action, unlike its later crucial role as a conduit for sustained U.S. covert operations in support of the Mujahuddin.  Washington, aware of Pakistan's sense of insecurity, especially because of the long-standing (1971) Indo-Soviet military alliance, sought to provide reassurance to General Zia, Pakistan's leader: this took the form of an offer of limited military aid, at a high level meeting with Carter's National Security Advisor, Brzezinski, in Rawalpindi on 2 February 1980. This marked the end of Pakistan's crisis.  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan also generated concern in many states, notably Iran and the PRC. The UN Security Council and General Assembly addressed this conflict frequently, in 1979-80 and throughout the long war, which dragged on for more than a decade. So too did many regional and interregional organizations, including ASEAN, the European Community, NATO, the Non-Aligned Group, and the Islamic Conference. Frequent resolutions were passed by these organizations calling for the withdrawal of Soviet forces--but to no avail until 1991 when the Soviet Union, less than a year before its own disintegration into 15 independent states, concluded that the costs of continued occupation of Afghanistan vastly outweighed the benefits.
Another crisis for Libya, Chad, and France in equatorial Africa occurred from 12 April to 10 November 1979. Shortly after the formation of a National Unity Government for Chad on 29 August 1978, fighting erupted once more between government and rebel forces. Rivalries among the latter and mass killings of minority Muslims in the south aggravated the situation. The Malloum-Habré coalition government broke down in February 1979. Thousands of Christian Saras were reported slaughtered in the capital by Habré's followers. By the end of February, FROLINAT leader Goukouni's forces entered N'Djamena. And by 11 March, when the first Kano Conference on national Chad reconciliation opened, there were four competing power centers, led by Goukouni, Habré, Asil, and Kamougue. France and Nigeria pressed Goukouni and Habré to share power. And this was done in a new Provisional State Council, Gouvernement de l'Unité Nationale Tchadienne (GUNT), formed on 23 March in accordance with an agreement a week earlier. Goukouni became interim Head of State, following Malloum's resignation that day. And in mid-April, after an inconclusive second Kano Conference from 3 to 11 April, Goukouni took over the Interior portfolio, with Habré as Defense Minister. While they had yielded to Libyan and Nigerian pressure at Kano to enlarge GUNT, they reneged upon their return to Chad. It was the volte-face by Goukouni and Habré that triggered a crisis for Libya on 12 April 1979, the onset of Chad/Libya IV. While there was some minor Libyan troop activity in the norththat began on the 13th, and Libyan support for a secessionist movement in southern Chad, its major response did not come until 25 June, following another inconclusive reconciliation conference, mediated by Nigeria in Lagos from 26-27 May. The four factions represented in the Provisional State Council were absent from Lagos; however, dissidents, backed by six of Chad's neighbors (Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Libya, Niger, Nigeria, and Sudan), demanded the formation of a new, enlarged National Unity Government by 25 June. When this call went unheeded, Libya sent 2,500 troops into northern Chad aimed at Faya-Largeau. The Libyan invasion, in turn, triggered a crisis for Chad and France the same day. The former appealed to Paris not to withdraw its forces from Chad. France agreed, and French reconnaissance planes and bombers played a crucial role in the Chad counteroffensive that forced the Libyans to retreat.  A second Lagos Conference, the fourth concerned with Chad in 1979, met in mid-August, with all eleven Chad factions represented, along with all of Chad's neighbors and also Benin, Congo, Liberia, and Senegal. The upshot was an agreement providing for the following: a cease-fire to be monitored by a peace force with contingents from states not bordering Chad, headed by the OAU Secretary-General; demilitarization of N'Djamena; amnesty for all political prisoners; the merger of all factional militias into a national army; and the formation of a broad-based transitional National Unity Government. When that government was established on 10 November 1979, the crisis ended for all three actors, Chad, France, and Libya. Yet the complex civil and international conflict over Chad continued.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis, the UN marginally so.
A Polisario attack on a strategic road in Morocco led to a crisis for Morocco and Algeria from 1 to 25 June 1979. A large-scale Polisario military operation inside Moroccan territory, on the Goulimime-Tarfaya road, triggered a crisis for Morocco on 1 June 1979. The targeting of an important mineral area within Morocco was quite rare. An additional incident took place on 4 June, north of Zag. The Moroccan response was multiple, including violence. Its troops met the Polisario guerrillas, losing about 20 soldiers, with a number of others wounded. On 6 June King Hassan announced that he had ordered the Moroccan army, in the future, to exercise its "right of pursuit" whenever lives of Moroccan citizens were endangered; that decision had been taken by the Moroccan Chamber of Representatives in March. The next day Hassan appealed to the OAU. Moreover, the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the Security Council were summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told that Morocco would not stand by "with arms folded" against repeated aggression. And on the 15th Morocco requested an urgent meeting of the Security Council.  The right of pursuit claim made by the king on 6 June triggered a crisis for Algeria, which feared Moroccan incursions into its territory. On the l0th Algeria appealed to the incumbent Chairman of the OAU, Sudan's President Numeiri. Ambassadors of the permanent members of the Security Council were summoned to Algeria's Foreign Ministry as well.  A major Polisario offensive took place at Tan Tan on 13 June. This city had been the victim of an earlier attack in January 1979 (see Case #299).  The Security Council discussed the issue from 15 to 25 June; no resolution was passed. On the 25th Morocco requested the indefinite suspension of the UN debate, having perceived the lowering of tensions after the incidents at the beginning of the month. Polisario attacks into Morocco had been temporarily stopped; and it did not exercise its right of pursuit into Algeria. Morocco's request ended the crisis, but there was no agreement between the adversaries. The OAU "Committee of Wise Men" (Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Guinea, and the Ivory Coast) met on 23 June to discuss the conflict and set forth recommendations.  There was no superpower involvement during the 1979 crisis. However, Polisario was armed with Soviet-made antiaircraft missiles, tanks, and artillery, while the United States supplied King Hassan with large amounts of military equipment, including jet fighters and radar.  (In subsequent years Morocco adopted a strategy of building massive walls of sand across the Sahara Desert, advancing steadily and bringing nearly one-third of the territory of Western Sahara and almost all of its population inside their ramparts. Since 1981 Polisario has been unable to breach the advancing walls. Nonetheless, despite military losses, Polisario has scored important diplomatic victories: it was admitted into the OAU in 1982; and in November 1984 the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was seated as a full-fledged member. In protest, Morocco quit the OAU. It was supported by Zaire, which suspended its participation.)
Soviet statements implying USSR intervention in the event of war between Afghanistan and Pakistan created a low-threat crisis for Pakistan from 1 June to 3 July 1979. Hostile relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan date to Pakistani independence in 1947 when Afghanistan demanded the creation of a separate Pushtu-speaking Pathan state in part of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. Several crises occurred over this issue, in 1949-50, 1955, and 1961-62 (see Cases #129, #150, #182--Pushtunistan I, II, III, in Afghanistan/Pakistan PC). Between 1976 and 1978 Kabul dropped its insistence on self-determination for the Pathans on the Pakistani side of the border, and an active search for a solution began. After the marxist coup in Afghanistan in April 1978 clashes between Afghan government forces and anti-communist rebels led to a large-scale influx of refugees into Pakistan. The nature and length of the border made it almost impossible for Pakistan to control the border crossings. A crisis was triggered for Pakistan by a statement in Pravda on 1 June 1979 accusing it of allowing Afghan rebel groups to attack Afghanistan from its territory, and indicating that the USSR would not remain indifferent. Pakistan, although perceiving its military strength as sufficient to cope with direct Afghan threats, viewed a Soviet-backed and Soviet-protected Afghanistan with alarm.  The Soviet statement, which charged Pakistan with willingly providing border sanctuaries to the Afghan rebels, made it clear that Moscow would intervene in the event of war between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan responded the same day with a denial of Soviet allegations, adding that it adhered strictly to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and calling for a resumption of normal relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.  On 11 June the Tass news agency charged that the U.S. was training Afghan rebel forces in Pakistan. This was denied by a spokesperson for the State Department: the U.S., as Pakistan's long-time patron, extended political support to its client.  The dialogue between Afghanistan and Pakistan was renewed on 1 July when Afghan Foreign Minister Shah Mohammad Dost arrived in Pakistan for talks with President Zia-ul-Haq. The crisis ended on 3 July with a joint decision to continue the talks: the two parties agreed to prepare the ground for a summit meeting. It was also agreed that the refugees in Pakistan would return to Afghanistan as soon as possible, on a voluntary basis.  (Agreement between the two parties did not alter the situation. The flow of Afghan refugees into Pakistan continued, as did attacks on Afghanistan by rebels operating from Pakistani sanctuaries. A summit meeting never took place. Six months later the USSR invaded Afghanistan and imposed a pro-Soviet regime (see Case #303--Afghanistan Invasion, in Multiregional PCs: East/West). Afghan anti-communist guerrillas engaged in warfare against Soviet forces lasting a decade.  The UN was not involved in this crisis.
Rhodesia, Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia were enmeshed in the decisive crisis of the protracted conflict over black majority rule in Rhodesia from 15 July 1979 to 4 March 1980. Guerrilla warfare against Rhodesia, as noted, began in 1972 and expanded in scope and intensity in 1976. Operations were carried out from bases in Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia. On 13 April 1979 Rhodesian forces captured 14 people in Francistown, Botswana, which had been occupied by ZAPU, destroying the ferry between Botswana and Zambia, allegedly used for supplies to ZIPRA. Clashes between Rhodesian and Mozambiquean forces, the latter better equipped than those of Botswana, were frequent in 1979. The attacks were primarily on economic targets. Some of the more serious recorded attacks took place on 9-10 February, on the Mapai-Pafuri road; on 20 February, on the Chimoio guerrilla base; the 14 March bombing of Chokene; and the 18-21 April bombings of Mozambique army positions in the Gaza Province. In Zambia, as well, raids were numerous. Zambia was the target several times in 1979, on 26 June, 1 and 20 July, 23 August, and throughout the month of October.  After the elections in Rhodesia in April 1979 a new government led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa took office on 31 May. Muzorewa quickly made it clear that his government intended to continue the policy of preemptive attacks on guerrilla bases and economic targets in Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia. The war inside Rhodesia-Zimbabwe escalated quite rapidly, with reports of about 1,000 people being killed each month. The number of guerrillas operating within Rhodesia during July was estimated at about 12,000. Early in July Muzorewa visited the U.S. and U.K. in order to seek recognition for Zimbabwe and to get economic sanctions lifted. A crisis for Rhodesia was triggered internally on 15 July 1979 when a large number of security forces loyal to Ndabaningi Sithole, the leader of the opposition ZANU Party (Zimbabwe African National Union), were killed--apparently by regular Rhodesian forces. Internal events, peaking with the massacre, made it clear to Bishop Muzorewa that his regime did not have the ability to cope with the issues at hand. Further, on 18 July the High Court ruled that seven MPs of the Zimbabwe Democratic Party could take their seats in Parliament, thereby causing Muzorewa to lose parliamentary control. On 25 July U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced that recognition of independence and sovereignty would not be forthcoming as long as the government and constitutional structure of Muzorewa's Zimbabwe-Rhodesia remained unchanged.  From 1-8 August the Commonwealth heads of government met in Lusaka, Zambia, and decided on an all-party conference to end the Rhodesian conflict. The conference would be held in London in September. Invitations were sent to the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia government and to members of the Patriotic Front, along with a draft outline for a new constitution for Zimbabwe.  The trigger to Botswana's crisis was an attack by Rhodesian troops and helicopters on ZIPRA bases at Francistown on 8 August. The response was immediate--an air attack on the helicopters returning to Rhodesia.  On 15 August Rhodesia responded to its crisis by accepting the invitation issued at the end of the Lusaka Commonwealth Conference: Prime Minister Muzorewa's decision was based upon the need to stop the internal challenges to his regime and to achieve some political stability.  A crisis for Mozambique was triggered on 5 September when important economic targets in the Limpopo Valley were attacked by Rhodesian forces. Severe damage caused a reduction in the country's capacity to wage war. Mozambique responded the same day with strong resistance by its army. Fighting in the valley continued until 10 September, and attacks on other targets were reported on the 13th, as well as on 27 September to 1 October and on 11-13 and 18-20 October.  During October Muzorewa sent a message to Zambia's president threatening to take nonmilitary measures if Kaunda did nothing to stop ZIPRA infiltration into Rhodesia-Zimbabwe. Indeed, this threat was realized on 5 November when trains carrying maize shipments to Zambia were prevented from passing through Rhodesia.  British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington opened the constitutional conference on Rhodesia at Lancaster House on 10 September. Lord Carrington played a very strong role in the negotiation process, often dictating the pace and substance of the talks. Specifically, he used the possibility of recognition and an end of sanctions as an incentive to Muzorewa and as a threat to the PF. By 15 November some progress had been made at Lancaster House: agreement on transitional arrangements for Rhodesia had been reached; and the British government had proposed the establishment of a Cease-Fire Commission on which military commanders of both sides would be represented.  Despite apparent political progress, Rhodesia expanded its economic pressure on Zambia with a series of major military attacks. A crisis for Zambia was triggered on 17 November when Rhodesian forces attacked a bridge on the main road to Tanzania; Zambian villagers were killed, and another vital bridge linking Zambia to Malawi and Mozambique was blown up. On the 20th Kaunda responded by declaring a full alert, canceling all military leaves, and announcing a call-up of reserves. On 12 December Lord Soames, newly appointed Governor of Rhodesia for the interim period, arrived in Salisbury to oversee the cease-fire, elections, and the transfer of government.  The crises for Botswana and Mozambique ended with a cease-fire on 21 December. The cease-fire culminated after months of mediation efforts on the part of Lord Carrington, in which he made proposals, issued ultimatums, and tried to allow the parties to save face. While Lord Carrington’s strong mediation role sometimes angered the negotiating parties, his efforts did help lead to the Lancaster House accords on 21 December. Zambia's crisis ended on 31 January 1980 when its border with Zimbabwe was reopened, once the situation had stabilized. And on 4 March 1980, with the election of Robert Mugabe, former leader of the Mozambique-based ZANU, as Prime Minister of the new state of Zimbabwe, the crisis terminated for Rhodesia as well.  United Nations activity consisted of a Security Council resolution, passed on 23 November 1979, condemning Rhodesia for its raids into Zambia and calling for full compensation. A condemnation of Rhodesia was also issued by the OAU. The United States supported the Lancaster House discussions. The Soviet Union provided military aid and advisors to ZIPRA.  (Following the elections in Zimbabwe, internal unrest persisted, especially in Matabeleland--where Joshua Nkomo, former leader of ZAPU/ZIPRA, enjoyed the total support of his fellow Ndebele tribespeople.)
A South African incursion into Angola caused another brief crisis for Angola from 28 October to 2 November 1979. In September 1979 Augustino Neto, who had led Angola to independence and had been its president since 1975, died. A day after his death Angola reported a South African attack on several economic targets in southern Angola by troops stationed in South-West Africa. Then, on 13 October, reportedly for the first time, Angolan forces crossed into South-West Africa. On 28 October South African troops attacked roads and bridges 190 kilometers inside Angola, in the Sierra da Leba area. Angola responded on the 31st with an appeal to the United Nations. The Angolan ambassador to Belgium and the MPLA's Politburo were especially vocal in their accusations of South African hostile activity.  Angola's crisis ended on 2 November when the Security Council adopted another resolution condemning South Africa and calling for an immediate SADF withdrawal. The U.S.'s abstention from the vote was perceived unfavorably by Angola. There was no change in the Angola/South Africa relationship after the crisis ended and no reports of withdrawal by the SADF from Angola at the end of the raids. The stalemate continued.  There was no regional organization activity during the crisis, though earlier, on 6-20 July, the OAU Council of Ministers, as well as the OAU heads of state and government, had met to discuss the ongoing dispute between South Africa and Angola.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
A crisis for the U.S. and Iran over American hostages held in Iran lasted from 4 November 1979 to 20 January 1981. On 11 February 1979 an Islamic fundamentalist movement led by Ayatullah Khomeini established a new regime in Iran to replace the exiled Muhammad Riza Shah. During the course of government efforts to crush the power of the clergy--90 percent of Iran's population belonged to Shiite Islam--Ayatullah Khomeini had been exiled from Iran in 1963, after leading students in a protest march against the shah. The shah's regime was protected by the Savak--a secret police force known for its harsh methods--and was bitterly opposed by many Iranians. The U.S. was viewed by anti-shah Iranians as propping up the shah, exploiting Iran's oil, profiting from the enormous sale of arms, and helping the Savak.  Two factions joined forces to overthrow the shah: a coalition of the clergy, masses of the Muslim faithful, and the traditional merchants of the bazaar; and the emerging class of Westernized nationalist students and intellectuals. On 26 October 1979, four days after the shah had been admitted to a New York hospital, young Iranian revolutionaries met and planned a sit-in at the U.S. embassy in Teheran. The previous week the provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan had turned marching demonstrators away from the U.S. embassy. On 4 November a crisis was triggered for the U.S. when some 400 Iranian students, acting under the inspiration of the new revolutionary regime in Teheran, broke away from one of Teheran's frequent demonstrations and stormed the U.S. embassy. U.S. marines held them back for a time with tear gas while diplomats within tried to shred secret documents. Minutes later the students occupied the embassy, indicating that this had been done in order to protest the admission of the shah to the U.S. for medical care. As support for the students grew, a decision was made to put the U.S. hostages on trial if Washington did not return the shah to Iran. The U.S. rejected this demand two days later. On the 6th, as well, the provisional Bazargan government collapsed.  In the following days President Carter sent two representatives, Ramsey Clark and William Miller, to Iran to seek to secure the release of the hostages. Khomeini would brook no compromise on his demand that the shah be returned to Iran for trial. On 10 November all Iranian students in the U.S. without legal documents were ordered to leave. Two days later U.S. oil purchases from Iran were discontinued. The following day U.S. and British naval vessels began maneuvers in the Arabian Sea. Iran called for a meeting of the Security Council on 13 November. All Iranian assets in the United States were frozen the following day, and the U.S. initiated action against Iran in the International Court of Justice.  On 20 November Iran suddenly released all black and female U.S. hostages. An internal political struggle began between the students and the clergy, on the one hand, and the secular political leaders in Iran, on the other.  After receiving medical treatment in the U.S., the shah went to Panama on 15 December. On that day, too, the International Court ordered the return of the U.S. embassy in Teheran to U.S. control, while the Iranians declared that the trial of the hostages would certainly take place. The U.S. approached the Security Council for economic sanctions, but the Soviet Union (and East Germany) voted against the draft resolution, thus preventing its approval.  Major efforts at negotiation began in January 1980. The UN set up a five-member commission under Secretary-General Waldheim to inquire into Iran's grievances. The U.S., in an effort not to provoke Iran further, delayed imposing formal economic sanctions on 6 February. On the 18th Iran's President Bani-Sadr authorized a visit by the UN commission. However, when it arrived in Iran on the 23rd, Khomeini announced that the hostage issue would be decided by the new Iranian Majlis (Parliament), to be elected in March. The ayatullah also called upon the militant students not to allow members of the commission to see the hostages until the commission's report was published. On 10 March the UN commission met with the Revolutionary Council. When the commission members felt they had reached an impasse, they gave up. Parliamentary elections in Iran were postponed on 22 March. The same day, at a meeting of the U.S.'s National Security Council, President Carter authorized a plan to rescue the hostages. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran on 7 April. And on the 11th the fateful U.S. decision was taken to send an airborne rescue mission to Iran. U.S. helicopters landed in Iran on 24 April. However, a collision between two helicopters, causing the death of eight U.S. soldiers, led Carter to abort the mission.  The U.S. attempt to rescue the hostages by military means triggered a crisis for Iran on 24 April 1980. By the end of the month Iran had responded by dispersing the hostages among 16 locations. Secretary of State Vance resigned on the 27th and was replaced by Senator Edmund Muskie. The shah died on 27 July in Egypt.  In September a German diplomat in Washington informed Muskie that a close associate of Khomeini wanted to meet urgently in Bonn with senior representatives of the U.S. government to work out conditions for the release of the hostages. A week later Sadeq Tabatabai met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The former agreed, on 22 September, to inform Khomeini of U.S. proposals, but on that day war broke out between Iran and Iraq, and the hostage issue was set aside. In November, two days before the U.S. presidential elections, the Iranian Parliament adopted the conditions outlined by Khomeini for the release of the hostages. Algeria was asked to serve as the mediator. The Algerian mediators controlled the transmission of messages between the two parties, often evaluating both sides’ arguments and making suggestions for compromise.  In December Iran demanded $24 billion from the U.S. to cover its claims on frozen Iranian assets and property taken by the shah and his family. However, by early January 1981 the claim had been reduced to $9.5 billion. Christopher flew to Algiers to work out a complex international agreement with Algeria's Foreign Minister, Muhammad Ben Yahya. The final documents were signed in Algiers on 20 January; and later that day word was received in Washington that the hostages had been freed--35 minutes after Ronald Reagan was installed as President of the United States.  Unsuccessful negotiation and mediation efforts were made throughout the crisis by Swiss and West German diplomats, as well as by private citizens. Pope John Paul II and Yasser Arafat of the PLO also tried to mediate between the two adversaries.
Colombia and Nicaragua were the adversaries in a crisis over long-standing competing claims to the San Andrés Archipelago. It lasted from 12 December 1979 to 8 July 1981. The roots of this territorial conflict can be traced to the era of Spain's colonial rule. In 1803 a Spanish Royal Order allocated the islands of the San Andrés Archipelago, along with three uninhabited cays, Quita Sueño, Roncador, and Serrana, to the viceroyalty of Santa Fé de Bogotá, precursor to present-day Colombia and Panama, extending to the Mosquito Coast. In 1853 Nicaragua claimed sovereignty over the Atlantic coast and its nearby islands. So too did independent Colombia.  The United States, which had controlled the economically valuable cays since 1869, took possession in 1919. On 24 March 1928 the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty between Colombia and the U.S. recognized the former's sovereignty over the San Andrés Islands. A follow-up agreement between them on 10 April gave Colombia fishing rights around the cays but recognized that sovereignty over these reefs remained in dispute. Nicaragua, which was occupied by U.S. marines in 1928, accepted the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty on 6 March 1930. A much later agreement between Washington and Bogotá, the Vasquez-Saccio Treaty of 8 September 1972, accorded sovereignty over the cays to Colombia and divided fishing rights equally between the two states. The treaty was ratified by Colombia--but not by the U.S. because of intense lobbying by the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. The ratification process was rescheduled for January 1980. On 12 December 1979 Nicaragua claimed jurisdiction over a 200-mile continental shelf, triggering a crisis for Colombia. Bogotá's initial response, on the 20th, was to repudiate the claim. On 26 January 1980 the United States urged a judicial solution to the territorial dispute.  Nicaragua escalated the crisis on 4 February by issuing a "white book" that claimed all of the San Andrés Archipelago; at the same time it indicated a willingness to negotiate. Two days later Colombia rejected negotiations with Nicaragua. Its major response to the crisis, on 7 February, was to reinforce bases in and around the San Andrés Islands and to deploy three surface warships and a submarine to the area. This high-visibility signal of Colombia's intent to use force, if necessary, triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. In the event, no violence occurred. Rather, Nicaragua responded with persistent pressure in an effort to block U.S. ratification of the 1972 treaty between Colombia and the United States. The ratification process took another 18 months, until 7 July 1981, when the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, which formalized Colombia's sovereignty over the long-disputed islands and cays. This ended Colombia's crisis, in victory, and Nicaragua's crisis, in defeat.  The U.S., as noted, was very active throughout and played a crucial role in crisis resolution. Neither the USSR nor the OAS was involved. And the UN was involved only indirectly: Colombia referred its grievance to the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was unable to settle the dispute.
Tunisia and Libya were the protagonists in a crisis from 27 January to 30 April 1980. Several issues contributed to strained relations between these North African Arab neighbors. One was a long-standing dispute over the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra): a ruling by the International Court of Justice had not yet been made. Another was a failed Libyan attempt at union in January 1974: the merger was formally proclaimed, but Tunisia withdrew within a few weeks. These and other bilateral matters were exacerbated by acute differences in character and leadership style between President Bourguiba of Tunisia and Libya's Colonel Qaddhafi. A crisis for Tunisia was triggered on the night of 26-27 January 1980 when a group of 50 Tunisian insurgents crossing the border from Algeria attacked and captured army and police installations in the oasis town of Gafsa, killing 40 persons. Tunisian security forces regained control of the town in the evening of the 27th. Interrogation of prisoners revealed that they had been trained in Libya, with the goal of forming a pro-Libyan "revolutionary" government that would seek and receive Libyan military aid.  Tunisia immediately sought diplomatic, economic, and military aid from Western and Arab states. France sent military transport planes and advisors to Tunisia on 28 January, triggering a crisis for Libya. This was followed by the dispatch of three French warships and five submarines on the 30th to patrol off the Tunisian/Libyan coast. The same day Tunisia expelled Libya's ambassador. On the 31st the U.S. defense secretary announced that the delivery of military equipment to Tunisia would be expedited.  Libya, too, responded to its perceived threat with several measures. On 4 February the French embassy in Tripoli was burned by a crowd of demonstrators. France's cultural center in Benghazi was ransacked the same day. On the 5th France recalled its ambassador to Libya. On the 7th Qaddhafi accused Paris of a new imperialism in Africa. Three days later he threatened war against France. An emergency meeting of Libya's General People's Congress on 12 February demanded that France withdraw its "invasion force" from Tunisia. It also called for an alliance with the "oppressed people" of Tunisia in their armed struggle to overthrow the Bourguiba regime. That day French military aircraft were withdrawn from Tunisia.  Crisis tension declined on 27 February when Qaddhafi declared the confrontation with Tunisia over, after the "fall" of Tunisia's Prime Minister Hedi Nouira, who was hospitalized in Paris. The next day Libya's leader said that the possibility of a serious confrontation with France, too, had ended following President Giscard d'Estaing's statement on the 26th that French forces had not actively intervened in the Gafsa fighting.  Relations between Tunisia and Libya remained severely strained during March and the first half of April 1980, particularly after the execution on 12 April of 15 Tunisians convicted of participating in the Gafsa raid. By the end of April a more conciliatory tone was evident in statements by the two adversaries, and the crisis ended.  The most involved actor, other than the adversaries themselves, was France. Both Tunisia and Libya appealed to the OAU in early February: the former called for condemnation of Libya's alleged involvement in the raid on Gafsa, and Libya sought a censure of France for its "invasion of Tunisia." First, Africa's regional organization on 15 February and then the Arab League on 28 February adopted resolutions reaffirming the principle of noninterference in internal affairs and respect for national sovereignty. The Arab League also established a four-member mediation mission – led by Iraq and including Kuwait, Syria and Jordan – and called upon the two protagonists to take steps to normalize their relations. The commission’s mediation efforts were minimal and did not contribute to crisis abatement. U.S. activity in this crisis consisted of the dispatch on 7 February of two air force transport planes with armored vehicles for the Tunisian army. The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
Morocco experienced another crisis with Polisario in their long-standing conflict over Western Sahara from 1 March to mid-May 1980. Mauritania withdrew from the southern part of Western Sahara in August 1979: it had received the area in 1976 via an agreement with Morocco as the successors to Spanish Sahara (see Case #261--Moroccan March). In an attempt to fill the vacuum, both Morocco and Polisario renewed their spasmodic military operations in various parts of the disputed territory during the succeeding months; but these incidents were routine, not crises. A crisis for Morocco was triggered on 1 March 1980 when Polisario forces reportedly defeated units from Morocco's Zegalla column dispatched to clear the area of Oued Draa in the north toward the Western Sahara frontier with Morocco. Serious clashes continued throughout the first two weeks of the month.  On 9 March the Moroccan force began the second part of its mission--to relieve the besieged Moroccan garrison of 4,000 at Zag. The Polisario Front claimed a major victory, a turning point in the war, in which they "put out of action" 2,000 Moroccan troops and caused heavy damage to Moroccan equipment. While Morocco denied these claims, it confirmed that serious fighting had taken place. And a call by Morocco's King Hassan to his troops on 14 March "to make the necessary sacrifices ... for the defence of the territorial integrity of the country" indicates a serious military setback: it appears that Moroccan forces were forced by Polisario guerrillas to withdraw to Jbel Ouarkziz.  On 24 March Polisario reportedly submitted to the UN, the OAU, and the Non-Aligned Movement documents purporting to prove collusion between Morocco and South Africa, which allegedly provided weapons in the campaign to subdue Western Sahara. But the international organizations did not respond.  Fighting broke out in the area again on 6 May after a few weeks of calm. Moroccan forces were more successful in this phase, claiming to have destroyed several "enemy centers" in a "large-scale mopping-up operation" against the "mercenary elements filtering across the Algerian border." Morocco also renewed its criticism of Algeria and Libya for allegedly providing Polisario with North Korean military equipment.  Clashes continued on 9 and 10 May and then tapered off.  In the nature of this protracted conflict, incidents continued to erupt, reportedly in early June, on 21 June, on 10 July, and again in July-August. Thus the conflict continued unabated--and is still unresolved. However, the March-May 1980 round of serious clashes related to Morocco's "Operation Iman" wound down by mid-May 1980.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
Angola experienced another crisis with South Africa from 7 June to 2 July 1980. Angola's crisis was triggered on 7 June 1980, when units of the SADF penetrated deep into Angola from South-West Africa and carried out large-scale operations in Angola's southern border provinces of Cunene and Cuando-Cubango. Prime Minister Botha of South Africa described the raid as a "shock attack" designed to destroy the operational headquarters of SWAPO.  Angola's major response was a request on 26 June for an urgent meeting of the Security Council. The next day it warned the Council that, if Angola's forces were unable to repel the SADF in the fierce fighting then raging, it would request outside help, implying Soviet or Moscow-backed Cuban intervention. On 27 June, too, the Security Council passed a resolution condemning South Africa for its raid and called for the withdrawal of SADF units from Angola immediately. This had a decisive impact on crisis resolution: on the 30th Pretoria notified the UN that all its forces in Angola had been withdrawn; but this claim was disputed by Angola.  At the beginning of July Angolan troops claimed to have reoccupied several villages and towns. Crisis termination occurred on 2 July: that day the SADF flew Western journalists and military attachés to the border zone, where they were briefed on Operation Smokeshell as an incident that had passed into history. SADF raids continued, but at a subcrisis level of intensity.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was active in this crisis, causing dissatisfaction by Angola. By contrast, as noted, the UN was highly involved. The global organization had been involved in the South-West Africa-Namibia Question since its creation in 1945, as the successor to the League of Nations Mandate over that territory. For years it had tried, without success, to arrange negotiations between South Africa and SWAPO to move toward independence for Namibia. The OAU reinforced the UN posture during this crisis. On 30 June its Council of Ministers condemned South Africa's intrusion into Angola and called upon the Security Council to impose comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against the Pretoria regime. These were to come many years later.
Egypt and Libya were embroiled in a personalized crisis from the 11th to the end of June 1980. Almost from the moment they came to power--Muammar Qaddhafi in Libya through a military coup in 1969, Anwar al-Sadat, who succeeded Nasir as President of Egypt in 1970--their relations were marked by acute hostility. There were several sources of this animus. One was personal rivalry for Nasir's mantle of leadership in the Arab world. Another was Sadat's marked shift to a pro-U.S. policy during and after the October-Yom Kippur War of 1973-74 (see Case #255, in the Arab/Israel PC). Hostility was accentuated by a violent border dispute in 1977 (see Case #281--Egypt/Libya Clashes).  Another source was Egypt's peace agreement with Israel in 1979, which Qaddhafi attacked virulently; in fact, Libya took the lead in the group of "resistance" or "steadfastness" Arab states in pressing, successfully, for the expulsion of Egypt from the Arab League. And finally they disagreed over Chad, with Libya supporting Goukouni Oueddi, Egypt backing Hissene Habré (see Case #304--Chad/Libya IV, in 1979--in the Chad/Libya PC). During the late 1970s Qaddhafi and Sadat engaged in frequent verbal attacks and some attempts at sabotage and assassination. A crisis for Egypt was triggered by Qaddhafi's blunt and provocative speech on 11 June 1980, marking the tenth anniversary of the evacuation of U.S. bases in Tripoli. Not only did Libya's leader declare that the freedom of the Libyan people was threatened so long as U.S. forces remained on Egyptian territory, he also unequivocally proclaimed Libya's "alliance with the Egyptian people and army in order to topple treason in Egypt" and urged a jihad (holy war) by all Muslims against the Egyptian regime.  Egypt responded on the 16th by declaring a state of emergency in the western part of Egypt, deploying troops to the region bordering Libya, and reimposing martial law regulations in force for 70 years that Sadat had lifted a month earlier. These measures triggered a crisis for Libya: Libya's Foreign Secretariat termed them equivalent to "a declaration of a state of war"; and it affirmed Libya's "legitimate right to self-defense." Libya added insult to the threat by holding the U.S. responsible for Egypt's "aggression," because "al-Sadat is not the master of his decisions."  Libya followed this up with a vigorous diplomatic campaign on 18 June, conveying its view of the crisis--as an Egyptian "threat to the stability of the region"--to the UN Secretary-General, the President of the UN Security Council, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, the OAU, the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO), and the Non-Aligned Conference. The same day the Arab League Secretary-General concurred, terming Egypt's state of emergency and its massing of troops on Libya's border "a threat to Arab security and general security in the region."  At an African ministerial council meeting on 21 June the Arab rejectionist states led by Libya failed to expel Egypt from meetings of the OAU and the Arab-African Cooperation Organization, despite support from the Arab League. The strongest condemnation of Egypt from within the Arab world came from the Political Committee of the "National Front for Steadfastness and Confrontation," comprising Algeria, Libya, Syria, and the PLO. Tension continued to increase, with Libya accusing Egypt of making war preparations along its border.  On 26 June the commander of Libya's forces on the front with Egypt said that Libya would not be the first to launch a war but warned that Libya had enough power to repel any Egyptian attack. The next day Libya's Foreign Secretariat repeated its call to overthrow the Egyptian regime. On the 27th, too, Egypt's defense minister de-escalated the tension by denying any intention to attack Libya and explaining the arrival of U.S. planes--for a 90-day joint U.S.-Egyptian training exercise. The crisis faded rapidly after that statement. In sum, it was intense in hostile rhetoric but without violence.  The U.S. and the USSR were not involved, though both Libya and Egypt expressed concern during the crisis about active support to their adversary. The UN was only marginally involved.
Poland, the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany were enmeshed in another major intra-Soviet-bloc upheaval from 14 August 1980 to 13 December 1981 (see Cases #141--East German Uprising, in 1953; #155--Hungarian Uprising, in 1956; and #227--Prague Spring, in 1968, in Europe: Non-PCs). Since the formation of Poland's Communist regime in 1944 there had been several violent outbursts of internal discontent, notably in 1970 and 1976, which led to major changes in both the party and state leadership. In the summer of 1980, too, a wave of industrial unrest gripped Poland in response to marked increases in food prices. However, violence was conspicuously absent from strikes and demonstrations led by Solidarity, an independent trade union headed by Lech Walesa, later the first President of Poland in the post-communist era. Yet for the Soviet Union, as for the U.S. in the Americas, unrest anywhere in Eastern Europe was perceived as a risk to Moscow's hegemony. This concern had already given rise to the Brezhnev Doctrine, during the Prague Spring crisis in 1968 (see Case #227, in Europe: Non-PCs): this asserted the concept of limited sovereignty among members of the bloc and the Soviet Union's right to intervene in the domestic affairs of any member when bloc interests--as defined by Moscow--were threatened by internal events. On 14 August 1980, 17,000 Polish workers at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk went on strike and occupied the huge industrial complex. They also presented a series of demands, some of which were perceived as political in nature by the Communist leaders of Poland. These events triggered a crisis for Poland and the USSR.  Warsaw's initial reaction was a government statement the next day criticizing the strikers' demands and noting the expectation of bloc allies that Poland's Communist regime would resolve its problems. Moscow's response was slow in coming--and indirect. The defense ministers and, separately, the foreign ministers of the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO or Warsaw Pact) met on 15-17 and 19-20 October to consider the challenge, more than two months after the initial strike by Solidarity. Prime Minister Pinkowski and the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers Party (PUWP) Kania, were frequently summoned to Moscow for talks with Brezhnev.  A crisis for two other bloc members, East Germany (the DDR) and Czechoslovakia, was triggered on 30 August by a 21-point agreement between a Polish government commission and a delegation from the "Inter-Factory Strike Committee": the Gdansk Accords seemed to include political concessions to the strikers. East Germany initially responded on 28 October by promulgating "temporary" measures restricting visits by Polish citizens to the DDR. And Czechoslovakia reacted on 11 November with a set of rules restricting the purchase of Czechoslovak currency by Polish citizens.  Contingency plans for a large-scale WTO military intervention envisaged 15 Soviet tank and motorized divisions, drawn from the DDR, Czechoslovakia, and several military districts of the USSR, reinforced by three Czechoslovak and East German divisions and another dozen Soviet divisions--a formidable force. In late November 1980 the WTO concentrated troops on the Polish border, the major response of the three bloc members. And the USSR's defense ministry postponed the regular half-yearly rotation of one quarter of all Soviet conscripts.  Pressure from the USSR, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia for greater resolve by Poland's Communist rulers continued. The buildup of WTO forces near the Polish border led to a report by the Intelligence Oversight Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives in January 1981 asserting that the prospect of a Soviet invasion remained "very high." On 4 March Moscow demanded from the PUWP leaders that the course of events in Poland be reversed. On 18 March WTO forces held maneuvers. Tension increased at the end of March and persisted through the spring.  On 5 June the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) sent a strongly worded letter to its Polish counterpart, expressing disappointment at the lack of leadership under Kania. On 10 September Moscow demanded "radical measures" from the Polish Communist leadership. These were taken on the night of 12-13 December 1981. Almost the entire leadership of Solidarity, including Walesa, was arrested. Martial law was declared. And a "Military Council for National Salvation," led by General Jaruzelski, was created. These acts ended the crisis for all four actors.  Western reaction was muted. U.S. Secretary of State Haig declared on 13 December that the U.S. was "seriously concerned" by Poland's declaration of martial law and by the arrests. Several members of NATO adopted symbolic diplomatic and economic steps to indicate their displeasure. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
Malta experienced a crisis with Libya over disputed offshore oil deposits from 20 August to 15 September 1980. Malta's political leaders hoped that the island-state could emulate the former colonial ruler, the U.K., and become self-sufficient in oil by exploiting offshore deposits. The most promising of these was the large Medina Bank 68 miles southeast of Malta's main island. Malta claimed jurisdiction over Mediterranean waters to a distance of 98 miles south of its southern coast, which was halfway between Malta and Libya. President Qaddhafi, however, as part of Libya's maritime claims that included the entire Gulf of Syrte (see Cases #330 and #363--Gulf of Syrte I and II, in Africa: Non-PCs), claimed two-thirds of the offshore waters, to a point 65 miles from the southern coast of Malta.  Libya and Malta had agreed in 1976 to submit their dispute to the International Court of Justice. Although Malta refrained during this period from prospecting in the disputed area, Libya proceeded with geological soundings. In July 1980 Malta's Prime Minister Mintoff responded belatedly by requesting the Texaco Oil Company to resume earlier prospecting in the Medina Bank on behalf of the government of Malta. In August Texaco chartered an oil rig from the Italian state oil company, which set out for the disputed area. On 20 August 1980 one of Libya's submarines and, soon after, a Libyan frigate began to harass the oil rig, triggering a crisis for Malta. Upon the advice of Italy's Foreign Ministry the Italian chartered vessel ceased operations at the Medina Bank. Malta responded to the threat by placing its minuscule air force on alert on 26 August. The next day 42 Libyan military personnel were expelled from the island-state. And on 30 August a Malta government statement accused Libya of endangering peace in the Mediterranean.  The UN became involved on 4 September, when the Security Council, at Malta's request, considered Libya's alleged "illegal act." However, the Council adjourned without taking any action.  Italy's intervention proved to be decisive for crisis management. On 15 September Italy and Malta exchanged notes formalizing an agreement on Malta's neutrality, announced a week earlier. Italy, an erstwhile protector of Malta, with historic interests in the central Mediterranean, recognized Malta's self-declared nonalignment and offered military aid and diplomatic support, in return for Malta's pledge not to join any alliance, not to permit foreign troops to be based on the island, and not to grant U.S. or USSR warships docking facilities. Italy also promised substantial economic assistance. That Italian initiative terminated Malta's foreign policy crisis and the international crisis as a whole.  (In the post-crisis phase UN Secretary-General Waldheim expressed his intention on 17 October to send a special envoy to Malta and Libya to mediate their dispute. On 13 November he submitted a report to the Security Council, indicating that Libya had undertaken unconditionally to seek ratification by Libya's People's Congress of a new agreement to seek adjudication by the International Court of Justice in December. Moreover, Libya reaffirmed its willingness to strengthen ties of friendship and cooperation with Malta.)  The U.S. and the USSR were not active in this crisis.
Iran and Iraq experienced several crises during Gulf War I, 1980-88. The first lasted from 17 September until 30 November 1980. The specific focus of conflict, which erupted into full-scale war in mid-September 1980, was the Shatt-al-Arab. Despite the 1937 agreement there were interstate crises between Iran and Iraq in 1959-60 and 1969 (see Cases #172, #234). Another agreement between them was reached in Algiers on 6 March 1975; and a more formal "reconciliation" treaty was signed in Baghdad on 13 June 1975 recognizing the Shatt-al-Arab as the common border between Iran and Iraq.  (Mis)calculating that the turmoil in Iran following the ouster of the shah offered a unique opportunity to assert Iraqi primacy over the Shatt-al-Arab, Saddam Hussein expressed dissatisfaction with the 1975 accord on several occasions in 1979. Relations between the two states became increasingly tense, exacerbated by growing unrest among the predominantly Arab population in Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan. There were also increasingly shrill mutual accusations of hostility and responsibility for cross-border land and air clashes.  In March 1980 Iraq began to launch commando raids into Iranian territory. On 7 April Iran placed its armed forces on full alert and responded with an anti-Iraqi propaganda campaign. On the 16th Iran announced the formation of a "Revolutionary Islamic Army for the Liberation of Iraq" and called upon the people of Iraq to revolt against the Ba'ath regime. The same day Saddam Hussein warned that war could not be excluded from the escalating conflict and demanded Iran's recognition of the Arab character of Khuzestan. And on 10 September he linked the clashes to Iraq's territorial claims. On 17 September 1980 President Saddam Hussein announced in Iraq's National Assembly the formal abrogation of the 1975 treaty; and he proclaimed full Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. This triggered Iran's first crisis of Gulf War I. Four days later Iraqi forces launched a major offensive, occupying much of the border area including parts of Khorramshahr. They also almost completely encircled Iran's principal oil refinery at Abadan. And on the 22nd Iraqi planes attacked six Iranian air bases and four army bases.  Iran responded on the 23rd with powerful counterattacks on air bases in the heart of Iraq, at Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Habaniya, Kut, and Nasiriya, triggering a crisis for Iraq. The same day Iraq occupied about 120 square kilometers of Iranian territory, after encountering only minor resistance. Its main offensive was in the direction of Khuzestan and Iran's key oil facilities. By 28 September Iraq was poised to seize all of southwestern Iran. The battle raged on, with the adversaries striking oil and other economic targets, bombing towns, sinking naval vessels, etc. On 5 October both Abadan and Khorramshahr were reported to be ablaze, and the Iraqi city of al-Faw to be deserted. The same day Iraq's governing body, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), withdrew a conditional cease-fire offer of 24 September and vowed to "continue the just and honorable battle whatever its duration and the sacrifices required."  On 17 November 1980 Teheran Radio claimed that Iranian troops had driven Iraqi forces from Susangerd. On the 19th, noting the absence of any further advances by Iraqi troops, Iran's President Bani-Sadr called for "total victory" over Iraq's Saddam Hussein: this marked the end of Iran's crisis. By 30 November, according to a consensus of foreign journalists reporting from the battlefront, Iraqi forces had dug in and a stalemate followed, terminating the onset crisis--and the first phase--of the Iran/Iraq War.  The U.S. posture, proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter on 22 September 1980, was "strict neutrality." However, because of the grave danger of curtailed oil supplies to U.S. allies in Europe and Japan, by mid-October some 60 warships of the U.S., the U.K., France, and Australia were patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, the vital passageway that links the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The USSR, too, from the beginning, proclaimed a policy of strict noninterference, while accusing the U.S. of attempting to exploit the conflict for Cold War ends. In reality, the Soviet Union and its East European clients provided limited arms supplies to both Iran and Iraq. The former also received weapons from Syria, Libya, and Israel, while France and North Korea sent arms to Iraq.  There were several failed efforts to mediate the Iran/Iraq conflict in the onset phase as, in fact, throughout the eight-year war. The UN Security Council unanimously called for a cease-fire, to take effect on 25 September. On 5 November the UN Secretary-General was asked by the Security Council to send a special representative to the area of conflict. Similarly, the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO) sent a Good Offices mission headed by the president of Pakistan. And the Non-Aligned Movement sent a mediation committee on 21 October. All third party efforts at crisis management were to no avail.
The Gambia experienced a crisis from 27 October to 7 November 1980 as a result of alleged Libyan involvement in an attempted coup. The Gambia's relations with Libya deteriorated in 1979. Most visibly, its government nationalized a transport company jointly owned with Libya, following Tripoli's apparent failure to honor promises of economic aid. Most important was alleged Libyan involvement in internal attempts to overthrow The Gambia's government. A formal protest was sent to Libya in March 1980.  In a related incident, Senegal, The Gambia's long-time protector--de facto since the latter's independence in 1965, formally since their mutual defense agreement in 1976--severed diplomatic relations with Libya on 14 July 1980: President Senghor accused Libya of training a mercenary army and attempting to destabilize the governments of Chad, Mali, Niger, and Senegal in order to assert Libya's dominance over equatorial Africa.  Apart from The Gambia and Senegal, several of Libya's neighbors saw its "long arm" in attempts to overthrow their regimes, as in Chad since 1978 (see Cases #288, #290, #304--Chad/Libya II, III, IV, in Chad/Libya PC), and in Tunisia (see Case #311--Raid on Gafsa). A crisis for The Gambia was triggered on 27 October 1980 by the murder of the deputy commander of its paramilitary Field Force. While the government later attempted to dispel rumors that this had been part of an attempted coup, Libya's embassy was closed and its staff expelled on 29 October.  The Gambia accused Libya of attempting to use its money and power to destabilize Gambian society. Specifically, Libya's diplomatic mission in the Gambian capital, Banjul, was accused of providing financial aid and training to two opposition groups in The Gambia, the Movement for Justice in Africa (MOJA-Gambia) and the Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party (GSRP), seeking to spread confusion and disorder in The Gambia. On 30 October these radical groups were banned. On the 31st 150 Senegalese troops flew into Banjul at the request of The Gambia's long-time leader, Sir Dawda Jawara--he held power from 1965 to 1994--to take part in a previously scheduled joint training exercise under the terms of their defense agreement. These troops took up positions around the State House, around The Gambia's Field Force barracks at Bakai, and at Yundum airport.  Stress among The Gambia's decision makers declined in the succeeding days. The Senegalese troops remained in The Gambia for a week. Their departure on 7 November marked the end of the crisis.  There was no UN or regional organization involvement or superpower activity in this crisis.  (Eight months later, Senegalese troops again successfully defended the Jawara regime against an internal revolt [see Case #329].)
Jordan experienced a crisis with Syria from 25 November to 14 December 1980. Instability has been the norm in the relations between these two Middle East Arab neighbors. They ranged from confrontation, as in 1970 over the PLO-Hashemite regime civil war in Jordan (see Case #238--Black September), to reconciliation, extending to an (abortive) agreement to establish a federation between them, as in 1975-76. Relations deteriorated once more in 1978-80.  Syria's minority Alawi-led regime, perceiving itself as increasingly isolated within the community of Arab states, accused Jordan of several hostile plans and actions: intention to make peace with Israel and to regain control over the West Bank and Gaza, at the expense of the PLO; harassing Syrians trying to cross the border into Jordan; and most important, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood within Syria in its attempts to overthrow the Asad regime.  However, none of these catalyzed a military-security crisis. This was a product of a Syrian initiative. On 25 November 1980 Damascus began moving armored units forward to positions on the Jordanian border. By the first week of December the military confrontation became ominous, with 30,000 Syrians and 24,000 Jordanians, supported by 1,000 tanks, facing each other. The confrontation lasted two weeks but without violence. Sa’udi Arabia’s Second Deputy Premier Prince Abdullah served as an important mediator in the crisis and facilitated de-escalation. Syrian forces began to pull back on 5 December, Jordan's on the 10th. By the 11th most had redeployed to their pre-crisis positions. The military confrontation and, with it, the crisis ended on 14 December. But the fundamental distrust between the two regimes remained.  Both sides could claim political gains from the 1980 crisis. Jordan had demonstrated resolve and capability in the face of dramatic pressure from its much stronger neighbor. Syria had indicated the likely cost to Jordan of breaking ranks with its Arab allies in the conflict with Israel, of abandoning the PLO, and of continuing to meddle in Syria's internal affairs.  The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya experienced a crisis over territory from 5 December 1980 until 29 June 1981. In 1980 two Somali offensives tried--but failed--to take control of Ogaden. On 5 December 1980 Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi and Ethiopia's ruler, Mengistu Mariam, called on Somalia to renounce all territorial claims against Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Tanzania--and to pay reparations for damage caused to Ethiopia in its full-scale attack on Ogaden in 1977 (see Case #282--Ogaden II). This demand, the culmination of an Ethiopian diplomatic offensive against the U.S.-Somalia military assistance agreement of July 1980, triggered a crisis for Somalia, which perceived it as a declaration of war: it feared having to defend its borders with Ethiopia and Kenya simultaneously.  Somalia responded two days later: a joint declaration by all of its governing institutions--the Supreme Revolutionary Council, the Central Committee of the ruling Somalia Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Council of Ministers, and the People's Assembly--called on the Somali people to defend their national rights. This was perceived as a declaration of war by Kenya and Ethiopia, triggering crises for them.  Despite the intense hostility and the danger of war--ever-present in the prolonged struggle for control over Ogaden and other Somali-claimed territories, there was no violence during the ensuing months. Crisis termination was signaled by a formal agreement for cooperation between President Barré of Somalia and President Moi of Kenya on 29 June 1981.  The OAU reiterated its opposition to Somali territorial claims in August 1980. Neither of the patron states, the U.S. and the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
France and Libya, the two major powers in this PC, experienced a crisis from 6 January to 16 November 1981 over the latter's merger plan with Chad. Fighting between Habré's Forces Armées du Nord (FAN) and Goukouni's Forces Armées Populaires (FAP) resumed in March 1980. On 6 June the former took control of Faya-Largeau, a strategic town in northern Chad. Goukouni's transitional government responded by signing a Treaty of Friendship with Libya on 15 June. Toward the end of 1980 the balance of political and military power in Chad changed dramatically following a large-scale intervention by Libyan troops in support of forces loyal to Goukouni, who launched an attack on the capital, N'Djamena, on 6 December. On 14-15 December Habré's FAN evacuated their positions, and a cease-fire agreement was signed the next day.  France, too, despite a warning to Libya and an expression of "grave concern" on the 13th, decided in principle to withdraw all the forces it had stationed in Chad since independence.  (Tension between France and Libya had become exacerbated by France's military support for Tunisia after an attack on the Tunisian town of Gafsa in January 1980, allegedly with Libyan involvement [see Case #311--Raid on Gafsa, in Africa: Non-PCs]. France was also concerned about a possible military confrontation with Libyan forces in Chad.) The catalyst to the fifth international crisis in the protracted Chad/Libya conflict was a joint communiqué by Goukouni Oueddei and Qaddhafi in Libya's capital, Tripoli, on 6 January 1981 announcing that they had decided "to work to achieve full unity between the two countries." The merger plan evoked strong adverse reaction in Africa. It also triggered a crisis for France, which responded on the 8th with a sharp condemnation of the merger plan. Libya's leader tried to offset the hostile reception by redefining the goal the following day as "full unity, rather than a merger."  On 11 January, two days after President Giscard offered to increase French garrisons in friendly African states, a fresh contingent of French troops arrived in the capital of the Central African Republic. This triggered a crisis for Libya, which was accentuated on the 15th when France's Mediterranean fleet was placed on alert.  During the following month Libya and France exchanged recriminations and threats: by Libya, to impose an economic boycott including an embargo on oil; by France, to act if Libyan troops in Chad moved to invade another state in Africa. In response to a series of threatening French words and deeds and in another attempt to deflect widespread criticism of the merger plan, Qaddhafi promised on 15 February to withdraw from Chad as soon as its government deemed the presence of Libyan forces no longer necessary. In March and again in May he announced the intention to withdraw the estimated 7,000-12,000 Libyan troops in Chad; but only 200 were evacuated.  Goukouni, along with France and several African states, was dissatisfied. In late April 1981 clashes occurred between Goukouni's forces and those of Libya's ally in Chad, Foreign Minister Ahmad Acyle. The calls for Libya's withdrawal from Chad became increasingly insistent after a series of Libyan air raids on border villages in Sudan, where the FAN was believed to be rearming and regrouping its forces. Moreover, Libya's approval of President Sadat's assassination on 6 October heightened tension with Egypt and other countries that feared further Libyan destabilization attempts in the region: Qaddhafi had already called upon the Touareg, desert nomads, to revolt against Niger and Mali.  Pressure from France and several African states finally led Goukouni to seek the withdrawal of Libyan troops from Chad. This was formally requested on 29-30 October. Nigeria provided the most important source of mediation, which enabled all parties to reach an acceptable resolution. An airlift of Libyan troops began on 3 November. And by 16 November all Libyan soldiers had departed, marking the end of the crises for Libya and France and the international crisis over the merger plan.  The most highly involved actor in this crisis, other than France and Libya, was Africa's regional organization. Following the announcement of the merger plan an OAU ad hoc committee held an emergency summit meeting in Lomé, Togo, and sharply condemned Libya's military presence in Chad. It rejected the merger scheme and called on Libya to withdraw its forces from Chad so as to enable the OAU to arrange elections in April 1982. This démarche helped to abate the crisis. The superpowers were minimally involved. The U.S., which had been providing military aid to Habré's FAN, issued a statement of support for Sudan, then experiencing border attacks from Libyan forces in Chad. The USSR, long a patron of Qaddhafi's Libya, continued its close military and economic relations but played no role in this crisis per se. The UN Security Council was apprised but did not take any specific measures to abate the crisis.
Ecuador and Peru experienced another violent crisis over their long-disputed border from 22 January to 2 April 1981. As noted, there were several incidents and two international crises over the disputed territory, in 1935 and 1941-42 (see Cases #50 and #86). The two disputants had signed the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro on 29 January 1942, which allocated the territory to Peru but gave Ecuador navigation rights on the Amazon River; it also called for demarcation of the border.  Demarcation work was suspended in August 1951, following Peruvian attacks on Ecuadorian posts in the disputed Gualingo area. In 1960 Ecuador declared the Rio Protocol null and void, asserting that it had signed under duress. Border incidents continued, the latest in 1978, a minor clash at a border post near Qualquiza, in Peru. The catalyst was a minor clash on 22 January 1981. Ecuador viewed the trigger as an attack by a Peruvian helicopter on a military outpost near Paquisha. Peru countered that its plane had been fired on by Ecuadorian forces while en route to Peruvian border posts with supplies. On 28 January skirmishes erupted, each side accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Peruvian forces occupied three Ecuadorian border posts. The two disputants closed their border, mobilized their forces, and suspended commercial flights.  At that point in the escalating crisis the OAS initiated mediation. On 29 January its Permanent Council called on Ecuador and Peru to accept a commission of inquiry. Ecuador agreed; but Peru balked, contending that the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol--Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S.--should be directly involved in any settlement. Peru also declined offers of mediation from the Colombian and Venezuelan presidents. The OAS Council also approved, by a vote of 20-0, an Ecuadorian request for an OAS foreign ministers meeting.  Per Peru’s request, the four guarantors of the Rio Protocol served as mediators in the conflict, and they met on 31 January and arranged a cease-fire. Hostilities ended on 1 February, and the cease-fire took effect the next day. However, while tension and stress declined, the crisis lingered. On 20 February a Peruvian helicopter was attacked by Ecuadorian forces. Both states again sealed their borders on the 23rd. The four guarantors once more mediated, with a proposal for mutual withdrawal of troops behind a nine-mile zone. The parties agreed, withdrawing their troops by 17 March. The border was reopened on 2 April, marking the end of this Ecuador/Peru border crisis.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
Mozambique experienced an inconclusive crisis with the Union of South Africa from 30 January to late March 1981. South Africa targeted most of its neighbors as part of a lengthy struggle against the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1970s and 1980s. These generally brief crises took the form of cross-border raids against alleged ANC bases--in Zambia (see Case #244), in Angola (see Cases #297, #302, #308, #313, #331, in Angola PC), and in Lesotho (see Case #339).  On 26 November 1980 Prime Minister P. W. Botha publicly warned South Africa's neighbors that continued support for ANC guerrillas would result in cross-border raids by the South Africa Defence Forces (SADF). On 28 January 1981 he announced the arrest of a KGB officer, Major Alexei Mikhailovich Kozlov, who was accused of spying in South Africa on behalf of the ANC and SWAPO. The trigger to Mozambique's crisis was a SADF raid on 30 January 1981, which destroyed ANC headquarters in Matola, a suburb of the capital, Maputo. The SADF reported 30 ANC members and two of its soldiers killed.  On 8 February the ANC president, Oliver Tambo, denied that there were ANC bases or training camps in Mozambique. The presence of Soviet warships in Mozambique waters at the time--the USSR and Mozambique had signed a treaty of cooperation in 1977--raised the stakes by adding a Cold War dimension to the South Africa/ANC conflict. On 19 February Soviet Ambassador Vdovin was reported to have warned of an "appropriate response" if "anyone attacks us or our friends." No such attacks occurred. There was a further minor border incident on 17 March; and the crisis faded late in March 1981, without an agreement, formal, informal, or tacit.  While the Soviet Union was involved in this crisis through the presence of a naval flotilla, the U.S. remained aloof. And the UN did not play a role in abating the crisis.
Israel and Iraq experienced a crisis from January until 19 June 1981 over the development and, later, the destruction of the Osirak nuclear reactor. Iraq had long been Israel's most implacable enemy. It was the only Arab participant in the 1948-49 war that did not sign an armistice agreement with Israel (see Case #120). Moreover, for decades it was in the vanguard of the Arab coalition against Israel, in word and deed.  Since the overthrow of its Hashemite monarchy in 1958 (see Case #165--Lebanon-Iraq Upheaval, in Middle East: Non-PCs), and especially after the Ba'ath Party came to power in 1963, Iraq sought to forge a nuclear capability. A pro-Soviet policy led to the construction of a small nuclear research reactor in 1968. In 1975 President Saddam Hussein secured a French commitment to build a larger reactor for "research." Israel's diplomatic efforts from 1976 to 1979 to persuade France to desist from this commitment proved to be in vain. A bomb exploded at Marseilles's harbor on 6 April 1979, with serious damage to a reactor that France had built and that was being dispatched to Iraq. On 28 October 1980 Israel's cabinet made a decision in principle to attack the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad. No date was specified; but a tentative date was set--soon after Israel's anticipated elections in November 1981. The rationale was expressed on several occasions by Prime Minister Begin: a nuclear weapon in the hands of any Arab state posed a threat to Israel's existence. A nuclear Iraq under Saddam Hussein was perceived as especially dangerous. A crisis for Israel was triggered by a French announcement in January 1981 that the Osirak reactor would be fully operational by 14 July. Israel Air Force (IAF) plans for a preemptive strike were approved by the cabinet on 15 March, to be implemented before the November election lest Begin be replaced by a Shimon Peres-led Labor government which, it was assumed, would be unwilling to implement this decision. On 3 May the Begin cabinet decided to act by the 10th.  The IAF attack occurred on 7 June, destroying the Osirak nuclear reactor and, for some years, Iraq's embryonic nuclear capability. The IAF raid ended Israel's crisis. Simultaneously, it catalyzed a brief crisis for Iraq--until 19 June, laying bare its vulnerability to Israeli retaliation and Iraq's relative military weakness.  (The initial world reaction was widespread condemnation of Israel--by the U.S., the USSR, France, the UN, and others the next day. Several days later the U.S. expressed its displeasure by suspending the delivery of F-16 planes to Israel, while approving a large-scale arms transfer, including Advanced Warning Airborne Command System (AWACS) aircraft, to Sa'udi Arabia. On 17 July the U.S. suspension was lifted. However, it was only in the context of the Gulf crisis and war a decade later that the major Western powers changed their public stance on Israel's 1981 destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor.).
Guyana and Venezuela experienced another crisis over a large tract of disputed territory from 4 April 1981 to March 1983. Following the 1968 crisis (see Case #228, Essequibo I), there were minor military incidents in 1969 and 1970, until Guyana, Venezuela, and the U.K. formally agreed to a 12-year "cooling-off" period, in the Port of Spain Protocol on 18 June 1970. Thereafter the boundary dispute was quiescent for a decade, until the approach of the expiry date. A crisis for Guyana was triggered by a Venezuelan government statement on 4 April 1981: it did not intend to renew the Port of Spain Protocol in 1982, and it opposed Guyana's Upper Mazaruni hydroelectric project in the disputed territory.  Whatever Venezuela's motives for this statement--to create an image of resoluteness for President Herrera before the 1983 presidential election; to exploit the economic and political vulnerability of Guyana; to strengthen its links with the U.S., since both Venezuela and the United States were concerned about Cuba's influence in the region; and/or to respond to pressure from Venezuelan nationalists to adopt a hard line--Guyana perceived a serious threat to its territorial integrity. It responded the same day by reaffirming its determination to carry on with the project, which was "crucial to the development of the nation." And on territory, Guyana President Burnham stated that his country would "not cede an inch."  In fact, during 1981 the crisis was characterized by a war of words and a diplomatic battle. Venezuela's ambassador to the OAS assured his colleagues in late May that there would be no armed conflict. More important, President Herrera declared on 2 June that Venezuela was committed to "keeping alive the historic claim to the Essequibo territory" and that his country would not renew the Port of Spain Protocol, which was due to expire on 18 June 1982. The U.K. was formally notified of Venezuela's position on the Protocol on 11 December 1981.  Apart from the war of words, there were other indicators of growing tension. In early June 1981, anticipating a possible internal or external attack, Guyana held a 10-day military exercise named "Operation Thunderflash."  Until the late summer of 1981 Venezuela remained the crisis initiator, putting growing pressure on a much weaker adversary. However, at the end of August a new catalyst emerged. Grave concern was expressed by Venezuela's foreign minister about the possible transfer of thousands of Cuban troops then in Angola to Guyana in the near future. That possibility triggered a crisis for Venezuela, especially since Cuba, alone among Caribbean states, had given unqualified support to Guyana on this dispute: Venezuela perceived a threat to its territorial aspirations, a finite time for response (the Port of Spain Protocol was due to expire on 18 June 1982) and a heightened probability of involvement in military hostilities, due to Cuba's unconcealed and active support for Guyana and Guyana's public acknowledgment that, in the event of a Venezuelan attack, it would accept assistance "from any nation that wanted to give it."  In 1982 tension was sustained by the continued war of words. It escalated once again on 18 June 1982 with the expiration of the 12-year "cooling-off" period. On 8 July the Guyana Assembly insisted on Guyana's right to the territory. During the next three months President Burnham expressed his fear of an invasion and refused a Venezuelan proposal for bilateral negotiations. In addition, Guyana accused Venezuela of violating its airspace and producing border incidents, in a letter to the UN on 14 September 1982. The same month President Herrera reaffirmed that Venezuela "wants a peaceful solution."  During the first three months of 1983 Venezuela and Guyana disagreed on the modalities of peaceful crisis resolution. Venezuela proposed bilateral talks; Guyana wanted to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice or the UN Security Council.  The crisis ended in March 1983 when both adversaries formally referred the dispute to mediation by the UN Secretary-General. (During all of 1983 UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar met with the leaders of the two states, but he did not succeed in finding a solution: the tangible dispute was accentuated by the personal antipathy between Herrera and Burnham. UN mediation continued intermittently through January 1999 and primarily involved fact finding.)  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis, though Venezuela tried to elicit U.S. support by playing the "Cuba card": the U.S. did not alter its stance of May 1981, namely, that it had "no position of substance on the issue."  (Other incidents occurred; for example, in December 1983 six Venezuelan fishing boats were seized by Guyana because they were allegedly fishing illegally in Guyana's territorial waters.)
Honduras and Nicaragua experienced the first of their four crises in the 1980s from 28 April to 13 May 1981. The last 15 years of the Honduras/Nicaragua protracted conflict were shaped by an internal struggle for power between the Sandinistas and the right-wing contras. This conflict has deep roots in Nicaragua.  The Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN) (Sandinista National Liberation Front) were the followers of General Agustino Sandino, who led anti-Conservative and anti-American insurrections from 1926 until his death in 1934. The "Sandinistas" triumphed over the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza (see Case #294--Nicaraguan Civil War, in Americas: Non-PCs). On 19 July 1979 they formed a provisional government, the first pro-Soviet regime in the Americas since Castro's triumph in Cuba 20 years earlier.  Almost from the moment the Sandinistas assumed power in Managua, U.S. antagonism led to financial support to the right-wing "National Resistance," better known as the "contras." From 1981 onward the contras launched cross-border raids against the Sandinista regime from sanctuaries in Honduras and Costa Rica, mostly the former. This was to generate interstate crises between Honduras and Nicaragua in 1981, 1986, 1988, and 1989. As soon as the Sandinistas achieved power in Nicaragua (see Case #294--Nicaraguan Civil War, in 1978-79, in Americas: Non-PCs), the contras began to mobilize funds and fighters, to organize in sanctuaries in Honduras and Costa Rica, and to induce border incidents between Nicaragua and its neighbors. Typical was the overflight of Honduran territory by Nicaraguan planes on 9 November 1980: Honduras claimed that it shot down two Nicaraguan planes in its Paraiso area; Nicaragua attributed the loss to its planes being "blown over the border by adverse winds."  In early April 1981 the Reagan administration cut off U.S. aid to the new regime in Nicaragua. And in the spring Honduran officers were expressing the view that "war with Nicaragua is unavoidable." A crisis for Honduras was triggered on 28 April 1981 by a Nicaraguan attack on a Honduran border post at Guasale, in search of contras. The same day troops of both states were placed on alert, and the border was closed. This catalyzed a crisis for Nicaragua. For Honduras it was perceived as a threat to territory, for Nicaragua, a threat to its political regime.  Clashes occurred on 3 May at el Tablazo and again on the 5th. On 7 May Nicaragua's defense ministry denounced Honduras for 120 acts of "aggression" and charged that Honduras disregarded five official notes of protest. Nonetheless, the same day a meeting was held between the Honduras President, General Policarpo Paz Garcia, and a senior Nicaraguan government official. After six days of negotiations a joint declaration was issued, emphasizing the willingness of the two adversaries to reduce the tension between them. This ended the low-intensity crisis of 1981.  There was no UN, U.S. or USSR involvement in this crisis.  (Although the contras were not directly involved in this crisis, their presence in the border area of Honduras was perceived by the Sandinista rulers of Nicaragua as a constant source of threat; and they were a catalyst to hostile acts by Honduras against Nicaragua [see also Cases #369, #383, #389].)
Syria and Israel, inveterate foes for almost half a century, were enmeshed in one of two missile crises over Lebanon in the 1980s from 28 April to 24 July 1981 (see also Case #357). Lebanon was, formally, a member of the Arab coalition against Israel since the beginning of the Arab/Israel conflict in 1947-48. However, it participated only in the first war of the protracted conflict (see Case #120). During most of the next two decades the Israel/Lebanon border was quiet, apart from several PLO raids from southern Lebanon since the mid-1960s, which became more frequent after its expulsion from Jordan in 1970 (see Case #238--Black September, in Middle East: Non-PCs). One of Israel's most dramatic responses was the destruction of 13 planes at Beirut Airport in December 1968 (see Case #229). In May 1970 and February 1972, Israeli armor and planes attempted, with little success, to destroy PLO and, later, Hizbullah bases in southern Lebanon in retaliation for cross-border raids against Israeli settlements in northern Israel. It was a pattern that continued into the mid-1990s (see Case #409).  The outbreak of civil war in Lebanon in April 1975 made a complex situation more unstable. Syria, which had long assumed a hegemonial role in Lebanon, intervened, occupied the Biqa (Bekaa) Valley in eastern Lebanon, and established its primacy in the entire country in 1976 by skillful "divide and rule" tactics, shifting its alignment with the Christian and Muslim-Druze-PLO contending factions in what developed into a 16-year civil war (1975-91). A cease-fire in October 1976 led to the creation of a 30,000-man Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) by the Arab League: Syria was the preeminent contributor from the outset; and from 1979 the ADF was a purely Syrian force. At the same time the U.S. brokered a "Red Line" agreement between Israel and Syria in 1976 that specified legitimate acts and constraints on their behavior in Lebanon (see Case #275). The 1981 missile crisis centered on alleged violation of the Red Line agreement. In the spring of 1981 the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia, were ensconced in the strategic town of Zahle astride the Beirut-Damascus highway. Aware of impending general elections in Israel, which Begin's Likud-led coalition seemed likely to lose, the Christian Falange leaders tried to draw Israel into Lebanon's civil war--and succeeded. On 28 April 1981 Israeli planes shot down two Syrian helicopters carrying supplies to Syrian troops on Mount Sanin overlooking Zahle. Syria responded the next day by deploying SAM-3 ground-to-air missiles in Lebanon and attacking the Christian militia in Zahle. As threatened by Israel's prime minister, Israeli planes destroyed the Syrian missile bases on 28 May.  Both Israel and Syria accused each other of violating the 1976 Red Line agreement: by the use of Syrian air power against any party to the civil war and the introduction of missiles into Lebanon; and by Israel's intervention in the civil war with air power far north of the Israel/Lebanon border.  On 5 May the U.S. dispatched Philip Habib as a special envoy to mediate between the parties and to end the crisis. Moreover, in response to continuing Israeli bombing raids against Syrian positions and the PLO headquarters in Beirut, on 10 and 17 July, the U.S. froze the delivery of F-16 planes to Israel on 18 July; they were released on 11 August, after the cease-fire.  Crisis abatement was the result of mediation and pressure on both sides--the U.S. vis-à-vis Israel, and Sa'udi Arabia vis-à-vis Syria and the PLO. A cease-fire was negotiated separately with the PLO--formally with the Lebanon government--and Israel. It took effect on 24 July, ending the crisis for both Syria and Israel, the two state crisis actors, and the Al-Biqa crisis as a whole.  The U.S., as noted, played the decisive role in crisis resolution. The USSR supported Syria verbally and politically; and it held joint landing maneuvers with Syrian forces as an indicator of its intent if the crisis threatened to overthrow the Syrian regime. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
A long-standing border dispute generated the first of several crises between Nigeria and Cameroon from 15 May to 24 July 1981. On 31 May 1975 General Yakubu Gowon, Nigeria's Head of State, and President Ahmadou Ahidjo of Cameroon signed an agreement in the Cameroonian town of Maroua: the access channel to the port of Calabar was to remain within Nigeria's territorial waters; and the rights of Nigerian fishers within a two-kilometer strip were not to affect the territorial waters between the two states. However, after the fall of Gowon in July 1975, the Maroua Agreement was not ratified or implemented by Nigeria. The territorial waters dispute remained unresolved. On 15 May 1981 a Cameroonian patrol boat fired on Nigerian soldiers on the Cameroon/Nigeria border, killing five and wounding three. This triggered a crisis for Nigeria. On the 18th Nigeria's foreign minister issued a formal protest condemning the attack as occurring within Nigeria's territory and warned that Nigeria would "fight back" if pushed further.  This verbal response triggered a crisis for Cameroon. On the 24th President Ahidjo delivered a message to Nigeria's President Shehu Shageri, expressing "regret" for the killing and calling for a joint commission of inquiry to resolve the crisis. Nigeria rejected the proposal and demanded an unqualified apology, full reparations, and the punishment of Cameroon's soldiers who opened fire. It also pressed for international arbitration of the dispute.  Pressure for a military response, including pressure from the speaker of the house of representatives, grew in Nigeria. On 27 May a group of Nigerians damaged Cameroon's embassy in Lagos. Nigeria's attempt to place the issue on the OAU agenda at the Nairobi summit in June failed; and it boycotted the meeting. Mediation efforts in July by Kenya's foreign minister, Dr. Robert Ouko, and the OAU Secretary-General, Edem Kodjo, were more successful in bringing about crisis abatement. On 20 July Cameroon's president reportedly offered to pay compensation to the families of the five Nigerian soldiers. On the 22nd Ahidjo accepted an invitation to visit Nigeria. And on the 24th a letter from Shageri accepted Cameroon's offer of compensation, along with its agreement to international arbitration to resolve the border dispute.  This terminated the first of several full-scale crises between these West African neighbors (see Cases #377 and #410).  There was no UN, U.S. or USSR involvement in this crisis.
Senegal experienced a foreign policy crisis as a result of a coup attempt in its neighbor and client, The Gambia, from 30 July 1981 to 29 January 1982. Dawda Jawara had been in power since The Gambia attained independence in 1965, at first as Prime Minister and from 1970 as President. Opposition groups had attempted to overthrow his regime on several occasions, mainly because of discontent over the state of the economy, and its dependence on groundnuts for most of its export earnings: one of these attempts generated an international crisis (see Case #318). On 30 July 1981, while Jawara was in London, the leftist 12-member National Revolutionary Council (NRC) led a coup against his regime, accusing the president of "corruption, tribalism, social oppression, and creating a bourgeois class." Within hours the NRC took control of the airport, the radio station, and most of the capital. They announced the suspension of the constitution and proclaimed their intention to establish a "dictatorship of the proletariat." The coup triggered a crisis for Senegal, which felt an obligation to intervene -- as it did in 1980 (see Case #318). Indeed, Jawara immediately requested Senegal's military intervention. President Diouf of Senegal responded on the 31st by dispatching 400 soldiers to its neighbor. By the 6th about 2,700 Senegalese troops were deployed in The Gambia. In the meantime, Jawara proclaimed a state of emergency upon his return to Banjul on 2 August. On 19 August, at Diouf's initiative, the two states announced their intention to create a confederation, Senegambia. A summit meeting in The Gambia's capital led to an initial agreement. The inauguration of the confederation, with the signing of a treaty on 29 January 1982, marked the end of the crisis. (Two days later Senegalese troops left The Gambia.) Verbal support for Senegal's military intervention was conveyed to Diouf by the U.S. president, the chairman of the OAU, and several African leaders. The USSR's Tass news agency denied allegations of involvement in the coup. The UN was not involved in the crisis.
Libya experienced two crises with the United States over the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra) in the 1980s. The first lasted from 12 August to 1 September 1981. Relations between Libya and the U.S. were characterized by undisguised hostility since Colonel Muammar Qaddhafi overthrew the Libyan monarchy and seized power in 1969. His anti-U.S. policy and pronouncements, military alignment with the Soviet Union, and frequent interventions in the domestic affairs of neighbors and more distant African states generated a U.S. image of Libya as "public enemy no. 1" in Africa.  Libya had persistently claimed the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra) as an "internal sea"; and in 1973 it extended the 12-mile limit of its claimed territorial waters north of the Gulf into the contiguous Mediterranean Sea. The U.S., by contrast, adhered to international convention, which viewed the Gulf as part of international waters, that is, the global commons. Thus, when U.S. reconnaissance flights over the central Mediterranean-Gulf of Syrte area began in 1972, tension increased. Qaddhafi warned the U.S. of a possible military confrontation if it continued to intrude into Libya's maritime space and airspace. Libya's active intervention in Chad throughout 1981 (see Case #321--Chad/Libya V, in Chad/Libya PC) further exacerbated the difficulties in its relationship with the U.S. This deterioration was accentuated by the closure of Libya's embassy in Washington on 6 May 1981. The ongoing dispute over Libya's territorial waters erupted a few months later. A crisis for Libya was triggered by a U.S. announcement on 12 August 1981 that its Sixth Fleet would hold maneuvers in the Mediterranean. Libya responded with a full military alert the same day. And on the 18th it accused the U.S. of violating Libya's territorial waters by holding naval exercises within the Gulf of Syrte. The next day two U.S. F-14s shot down two Libyan SU-22 fighters 60 miles from Libya's coast, but within the Gulf of Syrte--the only act of violence in this crisis. The U.S. also warned Libya against retaliation, threatening to use military force if Libya attacked U.S. aircraft or ships involved in the Sixth Fleet exercise.  On the 20th Qaddhafi declared that Libya was ready to defend its territorial waters even if it led to war with the U.S. or a World War III. President Reagan responded the same day that he had deliberately ordered the maneuvers in order to challenge Libya's claim to the disputed waters.  The crisis ended abruptly on 1 September when Libya's ruler threatened to attack U.S. nuclear bases in the Mediterranean and cause "an international catastrophe" if the U.S. once more intruded into Libya's Gulf of Syrte.  The USSR offered only verbal support to its client: Tass accused the U.S. of "terrorism." Acting through the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, all Arab states except Egypt and the Sudan criticized U.S. behavior. Both protagonists informed the UN Security Council of this incident; but there was no UN--or OAU--involvement.  (In effect, the 1981 crisis was a prelude to a more severe confrontation between the U.S. and Libya over the Gulf of Syrte, including serious clashes, in 1986 [see Case #363].)
Angola experienced one of its many crises with the Union of South Africa during the 1970s and 1980s from 23 August to 30 September 1981. There were several SADF "hot pursuit" operations into Angola, in May and at the end of July 1981. The most dramatic of these, which escalated to a full-fledged interstate crisis, was Operation Protea. Heavy bombing raids on the Angolan towns of Cahama and Chibemba, deep inside Angola, on 23 August triggered a crisis for Angola. These were followed the next day by a South African invasion consisting of two motorized columns, with 80 vehicles and 32 tanks. The town of Xangongo was reduced to rubble and was occupied on the 25th. Units of the South African Defence Forces extended their operations in several directions, with the aims of cutting off SWAPO guerrillas from possible escape to the east and of preventing interference by Angola's armed forces.  Angola's Defense Ministry responded with general mobilization and a threat to deploy 20,000 troops to repel the invaders. Supplementing this with diplomatic pressure, President dos Santos sought the UN Secretary-General's help in repelling the invasion, with a threat to invoke Article 51 of the UN Charter--the right of self-defense, including the use of Cuban troops then in Angola. On the 27th Angola requested that the UN Security Council demand an immediate withdrawal of South Africa's forces. The next day the commander-in-chief of the SADF announced that his troops were already withdrawing from Angola; but this seemed a diversionary tactic.  The objectives of Operation Protea were to thwart Angola's plans to extend its radar missile air defense system southward, to cover the strategic town of Cunene, and to create a no-man's land along the northern side of the Namibian border in order to act as a buffer against SWAPO infiltration into northern Namibia. While SWAPO bases were the primary goal, Angolan army headquarters in Xangongo had also been heavily bombed.  On 31 August, in accordance with the Reagan administration's policy of "constructive engagement" with the Union of South Africa's apartheid regime, the U.S. vetoed a Security Council draft resolution that strongly condemned the "racist regime" of South Africa and demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African forces from Angola.  On 1 September Angola's ambassador to Portugal renewed the threat to employ Cuban forces against South Africa's invaders.  UN pressure mounted with a resolution by a special session of the General Assembly on 14 September calling upon the Security Council to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa. At the same time South Africa's army commander pronounced Operation Protea a partial success.  Angola's crisis ended on 30 September with its reoccupation of Xangongo and several other towns vacated by the SADF.  The superpowers were active politically in this crisis. The U.S., as noted, adhered to "constructive engagement." The USSR called for unqualified condemnation of South Africa's invasion and the imposition of sanctions. So too did the OAU, which also urged the expulsion of South Africa from the UN.  (South African forces withdrew; but other incursions into Angola, in the long-term war against SWAPO, continued until Namibia finally achieved its independence in 1990.)
Morocco experienced one of many crises over the Western Sahara from 13 October until 9 November 1981. From the outset Polisario favored a UN-supervised referendum, including the option of independence. Morocco's King Hassan rejected this idea and pressed for a settlement with Algeria, Polisario's long-standing protector. Algeria insisted that only direct negotiations between the parties could resolve this byproduct of colonialism. The UN and the OAU shared the Algerian approach to conflict resolution. The Western powers, by contrast, notably the U.S. and France, were primarily concerned about demoralization in the Moroccan army and, therefore, potential instability in a pro-Western North African state.  Early in July 1981 King Hassan offered to hold a referendum in Western Sahara. On the 12th Polisario reiterated the need to include the option of independence. An OAU implementation committee adopted a compromise resolution on 26 August regarding the modalities of the referendum. Morocco demurred. A crisis for Morocco was triggered on 13 October 1981 by a large-scale Polisario attack--3,000 troops, tanks, and armored personnel carriers--on its garrison at Galtat Zemmour, 25 miles from the border with Mauritania. Morocco accused Polisario of launching the attack from Mauritania. The latter denied any involvement in the crisis.  The same day King Hassan informed the presidents of France and the U.S., the UN, and the OAU of the attack and accused his neighbors--Algeria and Libya--of supporting Polisario. On 19 October he assured Mauritania that Morocco would not intrude into its territory; but his field commander acknowledged doing so in "hot pursuit" of the Polisario guerrillas who had sought sanctuary in Mauritania after their attack.  During 10 days of fighting the Polisario guerrillas shot down three Moroccan planes, allegedly using Soviet-type SAM missiles, and put to flight Moroccan troops at their Galtat Zemmour base and another base to the southwest. The crisis ended by a unilateral act of Morocco: it withdrew from these bases on 7 and 9 November 1981.  Mediation efforts on the part of the OAU had proven ineffective. On 29 October, OAU Secretary-General Edem Kodjo visited the disputed area, where he spoke separately with Polisario Secretary-General Abdelaziz and King Hassan of Morocco. OAU Chairman Daniel Arap Moi also sent messages to King Hassan and President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria, encouraging them to cooperate fully with an OAU implementation committee. However, the OAU efforts seemed to not be a factor in Morocco’s withdrawal.  Soviet President Brezhnev, on 5 November, denied a Moroccan charge on 26 October that the USSR had provided SAM missiles to Polisario. The U.S. adopted a pro-Morocco "neutral" stance: on 23 October its assistant secretary of state for Africa affirmed a U.S. role in resolving the Polisario/Morocco conflict because it had relations with all the parties; but in early November a U.S. military delegation visited Morocco and reiterated its support.
Bahrain and Sa'udi Arabia experienced a crisis with Iran from 13 December 1981 to 8 January 1982. Bahrain is a tiny oil-rich Gulf sheikhdom, comprising 33 islands between the Qatar Peninsula and the Sa'udi Arabian coast. It has an area of 230 square miles and a population of less than half a million, half of whom are foreigners.  Bahrain was a U.K. protectorate from 1861, formally since 1880, to 1971. London's announcement in 1968 that it would end the protectorate and withdraw British forces from the Gulf in 1971 led Iran to revive its long-standing claim to sovereignty over Bahrain, as part of its goal of hegemony in the Gulf. Iran also had a territorial claim, having ruled the island from 1753 to 1783.  Like all the small Gulf sheikhdoms, which became independent following the U.K.'s further retreat from empire, Bahrain was vulnerable to encroachments from the three competing major powers in the region, Iran, Iraq, and Sa'udi Arabia. Two upheavals nearby heightened Bahrain's sense of insecurity from external and (foreign-supported or foreign-inspired) internal sources: the fall of the shah and the emergence of an Islamic revolutionary regime under the leadership of Ayatullah Khomeini in 1979; and the outbreak of a war between Iran and Iraq in September 1980. As that war dragged on, the increasingly audible messianic fervor of Iran's fundamentalist regime generated more intense fear among the Gulf sheikhdoms. On 13 December 1981 Bahrain's Interior Ministry announced the arrest of a group of Bahrainis and other Gulf nationals accused of trying to overthrow the regime: their attempted coup triggered a crisis for the island-state. Iran was accused of inspiring, directing, and financing the plot.  Prince Na'if of Sa'udi Arabia, too, accused Iran and termed the coup attempt a threat to Sa'udi Arabia and all Gulf states: the course of the Iran/Iraq War and the danger of an Iranian victory raised serious Sa'udi concerns about Iraq's ability to withstand the onslaught and the consequences of an Iranian triumph for the Sa'udi regime. Although there was some confusion about the source of the coup--some of its participants blamed Sa'udi Arabia at their trial--the context, the revolutionary zeal of Iran under Khomeini, and Sa'udi Arabia's fear that Iran aimed at undermining its own regime strongly point to Iran as the prime external source.  Bahrain responded with an official protest to Iran and declared its chargé d'affaires persona non grata. Sa'udi Arabia signaled its concern and protector role by signing a mutual security pact with Bahrain on 19 December; this response also marked the end of the Sa'udi crisis. Two months later, Sa'udi Arabia strengthened its hegemony among the Gulf states by signing similar agreements with three other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which was established that year--Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.  Crisis termination for Bahrain can be dated as 8 January 1982: that day, bolstered by the security agreement with Sa'udi Arabia and implied support from Iran's most powerful foe, the United States, to which Bahrain had granted a de facto naval base in the 1970s, Bahrain banned Iranians from the sheikhdom, suspended economic relations with Iran, and declared martial law. (In May 1982 Bahrain's prime minister tried to denigrate the coup attempt by terming it an affair that "did not represent anything dangerous to us"; but by then the crisis was over and the danger from Iran had receded.)  The USSR and the UN were not active in this crisis.
In the second phase of their long war (1980-88) Iraq experienced an intra-war crisis (IWC) with Iran from 22 March to 30 July 1982. The front line created by Iraq's initial advance into Iranian territory in September 1980 (see Case #317) had been pushed back by Iran up to 25 miles by September 1981. That month Iran's forces lifted the siege of Abadan, site of its principal oil refinery, and launched a new offensive capturing the town of Bustaneh in November 1981. By early 1982, although the war seemed to have reached a stalemate, the military initiative had passed to Iran, which repulsed several Iraqi counterattacks in February.  Iran launched another major offensive against Iraq in mid-March. This succession of Iranian military successes led to an increase of tension among the Arab Gulf states, which had supported Iraq both verbally and financially, mainly because they feared that Iran, if victorious, would be in a position to "export" its revolution to nearby neighbors.  Early efforts by regional organizations and the UN to mediate an end to the conflict were unsuccessful. The war became a protracted armed conflict, with the primary objective of both parties changing from the capture of new territory to the overthrow of the enemy's political regime. Iraq's IWC began on 22 March 1982, when Iran launched an offensive against Iraqi forces in the border region west of Dezful. During the next six days Iran scored its greatest victory in the war so far: Iraq was forced to withdraw from 350 square kilometers of Iran's territory.  Iraq's major response was to fortify the Iranian city of Khorramshahr, occupied in the first phase of the war, to ensure that it would not be outflanked from the west: the city became a strategic objective with high political symbolic value.  On 30 April Iran launched "Operation Jerusalem" to expel Iraqi forces from their last major stronghold in Iran--areas of southern Khuzestan and Khorramshahr. The city was recaptured on 23-24 May 1982.  In the face of defeat, Iraq initiated a unilateral cease-fire on 9 June and a unilateral withdrawal from 5,500 square kilometers of Iranian-occupied territory the next day. However, the intra-war crisis had not yet run its course. Iran was adamant about its conditions for peace, notably the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath regime in Iraq.  Iran's military advance once more generated fear in the Arab Gulf states and Sa'udi Arabia, along with concern in the U.S. and the U.K. about a possible Iranian invasion of Iraq. That concern materialized with Iran's "Operation Ramadan" on 13 July, designed to cut the main roads linking Basra to the north and thereby to isolate Iraq's major southern port. By the 30th, however, Iran's attempts to achieve a strategic breakthrough in southern Iraq lost momentum ending the IWC over Khorramshahr.  Many states and international organizations were involved actors in the second (Khorramshahr) phase of the Iran/Iraq War (Gulf War I). The USSR, for many years Iraq's patron and principal arms supplier, continued to deliver advanced weapons including aircraft--as much as Iraq could pay for in hard currency. So too did France. The U.S. sold Iraq a small number of civilian transport planes, easily converted into military aircraft. Regional actors were also involved, as Sudan sent a small number of volunteers to fight alongside the Iraqisand Algeria unsuccessfully tried to mediate the conflict.  On 28 May 1982 the UN Secretary-General renewed his call for an end to the war, along with an offer to mediate. The Security Council adopted another--of many--cease-fire resolutions. And the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on 22 October calling for a cease-fire and a peaceful resolution of the conflict. So too did the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO). In July 1982 the Arab League condemned Iran's invasion of Iraq.  The Swedish political leader, Olaf Palme, served as a UN envoy in March 1982. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) attempted the most substantial mediation of the crisis in June but strongly favored Iraq with large-scale financial support. Quiet diplomacy was attempted by the Soviets and by Egypt. All efforts at third party intervention, in this phase as throughout the Iran/Iraq War, came to naught.  (The long war continued unabated. In late September 1982 Iranian forces attacked Iraqi positions near Abadan. And on 1 November Iran launched another attack on Basra, aimed once more at cutting the road to Baghdad between Kut and the area northeast of Al-Aamorah and at the recapture of territory still held by Iraqi forces on the southern front. An Iranian attack to the north near Mandali occurred on 7 November with limited gains. By late November a stalemate was evident, with the opposing armies dug in for the winter.  From mid-August 1982 to January 1983 Iraq launched frequent air strikes, mainly against economic targets--Kharg Island and shipping in Iranian waters; but it, too, failed to achieve a strategic breakthrough or to recapture Iraqi territory lost to Iran in 1982. The long war had become a stalemate.
The U.K. and Argentina were enmeshed in an increasingly violent interstate crisis over the Falklands/Malvinas Islands from 31 March until 14 June 1982. The thinly populated island archipelago south of Argentina (2,100 in 1995) was discovered in 1592 by John Davis, a British explorer, and came under British, French, and Spanish control. Spain, the hegemonial power in Latin America until the nineteenth century, bought out the French in 1770 and drove out the British in 1774. It held sway in the islands until 1811. Argentina asserted sovereignty over the islands soon after attaining its independence from Spain in 1816. However, the U.K. ousted Argentina in 1833 and has retained control over the Falklands, along with nearby South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, ever since.  Argentina never recognized U.K. sovereignty over the Malvinas and frequently challenged it: in 1927, 1946, 1948, and 1953, and in 1973, when it submitted a claim before the UN, all to no avail. Negotiations between Argentina and the U.K. since 1966, at UN initiative, led to stalemate. On 1 March 1982 Argentina's foreign minister warned that, if an agreement on the islands were not reached shortly, Argentina would resort to "other means" to resolve the dispute. Two days later London expressed "deep anxiety" over this statement. On the 19th a group of 60 Argentine civilians raised the Argentine flag in South Georgia. Moreover, Buenos Aires rejected London's request to punish the transgressors and sent a ship with supplies to secure their well-being. On the 28th Argentina's foreign minister termed the situation "grave." And on the 30th British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington responded that it was "potentially dangerous." The same day the president of the UN Security Council, which met at the U.K.'s request because it feared an imminent Argentine invasion of the islands, called on both parties to seek a diplomatic solution. The trigger to a crisis for the U.K. was a British intelligence report on 31 March that an Argentine invasion of the Falklands was imminent. Prime Minister Thatcher cabled President Reagan the same day seeking his personal intervention with President Galtieri, to no avail. The U.K. leaders decided on 1 April to send a task force to the South Atlantic, recognizing that it would take 26 days to reach the Falklands.  On 2 April Argentine troops took control of the islands after less than four hours of combat. UN Security Council Resolution 502, on 3 April, condemned the Argentine invasion and called for its immediate withdrawal. The same day Britain's prime minister announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Buenos Aires and pledged before parliament her determination to regain control of the islands.  The U.K.'s dispatch of a large naval task force to the South Atlantic on 5 April triggered a crisis for Argentina: its leaders did not expect a British military riposte to their invasion of the islands. The next day London imposed economic sanctions on Argentina--the U.K. was its major investor and trading partner. The European Community (EC) approved the sanctions on the 10th. Argentina responded three days later with economic sanctions on all EC products. The European parliament condemned the Argentine invasion on 22 April.  Argentina mobilized 100,000 reservists on 9 April. The OAS, meeting on 22 April at Argentina's request, did not condemn U.K. behavior. Three days later British forces regained control of South Georgia. Argentina proclaimed a technical state of war the same day and informed the Security Council.  On 26 April the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against Argentina. On the 28th, in a marked shift, the OAS adopted a resolution recognizing Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas and calling upon the U.K. to withdraw its forces. Full-scale war erupted from the moment the British naval task force reached the Falklands. Argentina's foreign minister accepted the idea of U.S. mediation on 6 May. On the 21st 5,000 British troops landed on East Falkland Island. On the 25th the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 505 requesting Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to renew an offer of good offices in an attempt to resolve the conflict. The OAS adopted a resolution on 29 May condemning the U.K. On 3 June British marines began their attack on the main Argentine garrison at Port Stanley. Argentine troops surrendered on 14 June terminating the crisis for both Argentina and the U.K. The outcome was unqualified victory for the U.K. and humiliating defeat for Argentina. There were almost 1,000 casualties in the war over the Falklands/Malvinas, 250 British, 700 on the Argentine side.  As noted, the U.S. played a conspicuous role. It attempted to prevent the Argentine invasion. Then, through the efforts of Secretary of State Haig, Washington tried to mediate an accommodation between the parties. From 8-21 April, Haig shuttled back and forth between London and Buenos Aires, delivering messages, helping formulate proposals and actively pressuring Argentina. And when these efforts failed after Argentina rejected Haig’s request to continue mediation on 27 April, the U.S. declared its support for U.K. rights in the Falklands. The USSR adopted a passive posture, though it supported Argentina's aspirations, verbally. As noted, too, the UN and the OAS passed resolutions condemning one or the other party and sought to resolve the crisis by mediation, without success.  (Diplomatic relations between Argentina and the U.K. were restored in 1992. And in mid-September 1995 they reached agreement over their disputed claims to large natural gas and oil resources in the vicinity of the islands, reportedly, two-thirds of the earnings to the U.K., one-third to Argentina. The dispute over territory remains unresolved.)
Lebanon, Syria, and Israel were the crisis actors in the Lebanon War from 5 June 1982 until 17 May 1983. From the beginning of the Arab/Israel protracted conflict in 1947-48 (see Case #120) until 1970, the border between Israel and Lebanon was relatively quiescent. However, as a result of the PLO's severe defeat in a military confrontation with the regime of King Hussein in 1970 (see Case #238--Black September, in Middle East: Non-PCs), most of its forces were transferred from Jordan to bases in south Lebanon. From there they launched raids into northern Israel in a prolonged guerrilla campaign.  The PLO also became enmeshed in Lebanon's intercommunal strife, a near constant in the Christian-Muslim struggle for control of the government and army in Lebanon since 1943. Full-scale civil war erupted in April 1975.  On 14 March 1978, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded Lebanon in retaliation for a PLO raid in Israel's heartland, north of Tel Aviv, three days earlier, in which 35 Israelis were killed and 70 others wounded. Hostilities ended at the end of March, but IDF units did not withdraw until 13 June 1978 (see Case #289). An Israeli decision in principle to attack PLO bases in Lebanon was made on 21 April 1982. On 9 May 100 Katyusha rockets were fired from south Lebanon into Israel's northern Galilee settlements. IDF troops were dispatched to the Lebanese border several days later. On 3 June Israel's Ambassador to the U.K., Shlomo Argov, was gravely wounded in a terrorist attack in London. Israeli planes bombed PLO sites in Beirut. At the instigation of Israel Defense Minister Sharon, IDF forces responded to the London incident by activating a long-standing "Peace for Galilee" operation: they invaded Lebanon on 5 June along three fronts, triggering a crisis for Lebanon. Jerusalem signaled Damascus via Washington that its forces would not cross into Syria unless Israel was attacked by Syrian forces. However, the rapid IDF advance in Lebanon brought Israeli forces into direct conflict with Syrian troops in the Biqa Valley of Lebanon on 7 June, catalyzing a crisis for Syria. This was accentuated on 8-9 June by an air battle that reportedly led to the shooting down of 60 Syrian planes. The direct confrontation with Syria led to a crisis for Israel.  Initial U.S. mediation, through special envoy Philip Habib, led to a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Syria on 11 June. However, continued IDF/PLO clashes led to a renewal of Israel/Syria hostilities. By 24 June IDF forces succeeded in cutting the strategic Beirut-Damascus highway, the key to Syria's military control over Lebanon. And by early July IDF forces laid siege to Beirut.  Persistent mediation by U.S. Ambassador Habib led to a complex agreement that resolved the crisis for Israel and Syria--but not the Lebanon War--on 1 September 1982. By that date the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Beirut, which began on 21 August, was complete. PLO forces completed their withdrawal from Lebanon on 1 September to nine locations in the Arab world, temporarily ceasing to be a meaningful military force in the Arab/Israel conflict. And IDF forces pulled back from the outskirts of Lebanon's capital. The crisis for Lebanon ended with the (abortive) peace agreement with Israel on 17 May 1983.  The UN and the U.S. were very active in efforts to resolve the crisis and terminate the Lebanon War. As early as 6 June the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the recognized Israel-Lebanon border. A Security Council resolution on 20 June calling on both PLO and IDF forces to withdraw from the Beirut area was vetoed by the U.S. Altogether, nine UN resolutions were passed during the Lebanon War, including those on 1 and 12 August by the Security Council and 19 August by the General Assembly, most of them condemning Israel; but not one was heeded.  The U.S. role was far more consequential. On 8 July, along with France and Italy, it announced a willingness to send troops to Lebanon in order to reestablish stability. On 19 July Washington temporarily suspended military aid to Israel because of its invasion of Lebanon. On 5 August it called upon Israel to withdraw to the prewar cease-fire lines. As noted, the U.S. mediated an initial Israel/Syria cease-fire, and the agreement of 1 September 1982, which ended the Lebanon War, though not all hostilities. Washington, through Secretary of State Shultz, also brokered the abortive Israel/Lebanon agreement of 17 May 1983.  The USSR adopted a low profile vis-à-vis the Lebanon War, compared with its role in the 1956, 1967, and 1973 Arab/Israel wars (see Cases #152, #222, #255). It condemned Israel several times. Two messages were sent to PLO Chairman Arafat expressing verbal support for his cause. And, most substantively, it sent military aid to Syria to replace losses during the fighting. The Arab League did not meet until after the end of the Lebanon War. At a summit conference in Fez, Morocco, on 6-9 September, it proposed a peace plan for the Arab/Israel conflict, which was rejected by Israel.  (Direct talks between the governments of Israel and Lebanon under U.S. auspices, beginning in late December 1982, led to the initialing of a peace agreement on 17 May 1983. It included the creation of an Israeli "security zone" in south Lebanon designed to protect Israeli settlements in northern Galilee against PLO or other trans-border attacks. Syria, the most influential external power in the internal affairs of Lebanon, opposed the agreement as a grave danger to its security; and the Israel/Lebanon peace agreement was never ratified.)  (Low-intensity military hostilities in Lebanon and a massive IDF presence in Lebanon continued until 1985. IDF forces continued to control the "security zone" more than a decade later.)
Somalia and Ethiopia experienced another crisis over the Ogaden Desert from 30 June until August 1982. Another international crisis erupted on 30 June 1982, when Ethiopian troops attacked Somali army units in the Hiran region, thereby threatening to sever communications between the two halves of Somalia. Ethiopia was accused by Mogadishu of "naked aggression." And on 12 July Somalia's President Barré sought OAU and UN support against Ethiopia's alleged plans for full-scale war. Two days later Africa's regional organization called upon Ethiopia to desist from destabilizing East Africa.  Somalia responded with an urgent request to the U.S. for assistance. The U.S. began a flow of arms and economic aid in July, in accordance with a 1980 agreement that granted U.S. forces valuable naval and air facilities at the northern Somali port of Berbera. U.S. aid triggered a crisis for Ethiopia, which declared on 26 July that this posed a threat to its territorial integrity. Ethiopia also denied that it had invaded Somalia.  Barré declared a state of emergency in the war zone on 15 September, following Ethiopia's successful incursion 20 miles into Somali territory. However, with no further advances by either party, the crisis faded in August 1982.  The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
Lesotho experienced a crisis with the Union of South Africa from 9 to 15 December 1982. Lesotho, like Angola and Zambia, experienced violent crises with South Africa from the early 1970s, as part of Pretoria's continuing struggle against the African National Congress (ANC) ( Case #323). In early 1982, economic and political sites in Lesotho were attacked. On 26 May the Prime Minister of Lesotho, Chief Jonathan, accused the Pretoria regime of supporting these raids, a charge that was emphatically denied.  On 7 August Lesotho's Minister of Works, Jobo K. Rampeta, was killed in an ambush. The next day Pretoria sent a message of sympathy. On the 11th Lesotho rejected this apology. A border incident was reported the same day; and, once more, Lesotho accused South Africa of responsibility. A crisis for Lesotho was triggered on 9 December 1982 when the South Africa Defence Forces launched a raid against the homes of ANC members in its capital, Maseru, killing 32. The next day Chief Jonathan condemned the raid. A complaint to the UN led to a Security Council resolution on 15 December, condemning South Africa's attack. This terminated Lesotho's crisis.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved.  (On 9 February 1983 South Africa's foreign minister, in a letter to the UN Secretary-General, rejected the resolution, asserted Pretoria's wish to negotiate nonaggression pacts with its neighbors, and claimed the right to take measures to defend the life and property of its citizens.)  (See also Case #360.)
Sudan, Egypt, and Libya were enmeshed in a crisis from 11 to 22 February 1983. Sudan and Libya experienced a basic change in political regime almost simultaneously: a seizure of power by Brigadier-General Numeiri in Khartoum in May 1969; and a coup d'état led by Colonel Qaddhafi in Tripoli in September 1969, overthrowing the monarchy. Both proved to be durable leaders--Numeiri, until his ouster in 1985; and Qaddhafi, who is still in power. However, the two regimes differed markedly: Numeiri was pro-West; and Qaddhafi projected a messianic role, designed to transform the Arab world. The result was increasing tension and hostility between the two leaders and their states during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Sudan perceived continuous attempts at subversion by Qaddhafi, aimed at expanding his influence in Africa and the Arab world through mergers, as with Chad, Egypt, and Tunisia. Diplomatic relations were severed in 1976-77 and from 1981 to 1985. There were many border incidents and alleged overflights of Sudan's territory. One of these generated an international crisis.  Tension escalated in the autumn of 1983 with a visible increase in Libya's military presence, notably air power, near Sudan's northern border: MIG-23s and TU-22 bombers supplied by the Soviet Union were concentrated near the border. Evidence of a Libya military buildup and the perception in Khartoum and Cairo, by 11 February, of a Libyan plan to overthrow the Numeiri regime triggered a crisis for Sudan and Egypt. The next day Sudan complained to the UN and placed its forces on alert. Egypt, too, perceived Libya's military buildup as a threat, especially because of its commitments to Sudan under the terms of their mutual defense agreement in 1976 and their Charter of Integration in October 1982. Cairo responded on the 12th by sending fighter planes close to its border with Sudan and transport planes to Aswan in southern Egypt, within easy distance for a rapid deployment of troops to Sudan. President Mubarak also warned the U.S. of an impending Libyan attack on Sudan.  On 17 February the U.S. became militarily involved, though not as a full-fledged crisis actor: it dispatched four multipurpose AWACS reconnaissance planes to Egypt and the aircraft carrier, Nimitz, to the Red Sea off the coast of Sudan and Egypt. These signals of U.S. resolve to support Arab allies triggered a crisis for Libya. It responded the next day by concentrating more air power near the Egyptian border. On the 21st Sudan renewed its charge of a growing Libyan military buildup close to its border, despite U.S. and Egyptian assurances that the Libyan threat had declined. The same day Egypt accused Libya of interfering in Sudan's internal affairs and affirmed that it would assist Sudan's defense against military intervention. Sudan renewed this charge the next day and accused Libya of violating its airspace. However, on the 22nd Numeiri and Mubarak met in Khartoum to consider the implementation of their 1982 integration agreement: this reduced Sudan's stress and ended the 11-day crisis for all three actors, along with the international crisis as a whole.  The UN Security Council, on 22 February, provided a forum for debate on the crisis between Sudan and Libya; but it did not play a role in crisis management. And the USSR was not involved directly: its supply of arms to Libya made possible--but did not shape--Qaddhafi's behavior toward his neighbors.  (A year later, the same three actors were embroiled in another crisis [see Case #350].)
Chad and Nigeria experienced a border crisis from 18 April until 11 July 1983. Both of these states were granted independence in 1960--Chad by France, Nigeria by the U.K. Relations were cooperative until the late 1970s, when oil exploration in the undemarcated Lake Chad region portended substantial wealth for the beneficiary of the discovery of oil.  The bilateral relationship was complicated by the role of Nigerian soldiers as peacekeepers in Chad, under OAU auspices in 1979 and again in 1981 at the invitation of the then-victorious Goukouni regime. They were compelled to leave Chad by Habré, who replaced Goukouni in 1982.  The problem was compounded by the emergence of new islands in the Lake Chad region as a result of falling water levels in the lake. Some of these were being used as sanctuaries by anti-Habré Chadian forces, who were harassing Nigerian fishers. Amid incidents along the border, Nigerian soldiers were sent to Kinsara Island in the disputed Lake Chad area on 18 April 1983 to protect Nigerian fishers. This was perceived as a threat to territory and triggered a crisis for Chad. Its violent response the same day catalyzed a crisis for Nigeria. Serious clashes ensued until 24 April. At the end of April Chadian troops attacked--and recaptured--Kinsara Island. Nigeria responded with retaliatory raids.  In late May the intensity of the border clashes seemed to subside. Nigeria's foreign minister spoke, prematurely, about a peaceful solution based upon revived joint patrols of the border area, along with demarcation, by a committee appointed by the Chad Basin Commission, of the borders of its four member-states, Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.  Intermittent clashes continued until 2 July when the presidents of Chad and Nigeria met. An agreement signed on 11 July formally ended the fighting and reopened the disputed border, terminating the crisis. There were few casualties in the fighting, an estimated 75 Chadian soldiers and nine Nigerians.  The two superpowers, the UN, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
Chad, France, and Libya were embroiled in another international crisis from 24 June 1983 to 11 December 1984. After a lull in Qaddhafi's involvement in Chad--because of his (failed) attempt to become chairman of the OAU--he became more active from late October 1982 onward. He recognized Goukouni's transitional government and supported his forces with arms and equipment in the prolonged civil war for mastery of Chad. He also resumed reconnaissance flights over Chad. Habré accused Qaddhafi of planning to attack the Aozou Strip; the Libyan leader denied the accusation.  In February 1983 talks between Habré and Qaddhafi broke down. In March Habré accused Libya of being directly involved in the Chadian internal struggle for power, following Goukouni's capture of a strategic outpost on the road to Chad's capital. On 17 March Chad asked for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to consider Libya's "aggression and occupation" of Chadian territory. On 17 May Chad (Habré) claimed to have repulsed a rebel (Goukouni) attack against the strategic oasis, Faya-Largeau, gateway to control over the northern part of Chad. The persistent low-intensity conflict, interstate (Chad/Libya) and intrastate (Habré/Goukouni), generated another full-scale crisis for Chad on 24 June 1983, when Libya-supported Goukouni forces occupied Faya-Largeau. The same day French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson warned Libya that France would "not remain indifferent" to Libya's intervention in Chad. Moreover, France (and Zaire) decided to dispatch military aid to the Habré regime, in response to its appeal on 5 July for direct military support. On the 11th Chad accused Libya once more of direct involvement in its internal crisis. The OAU discussed the matter on the 15th and called for an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign forces from Chad, and the resumption of negotiations between the contending parties within Chad.  Along with its diplomatic efforts to oust Libya, Chad's (Habré's) forces, assisted by weapons from France, Zaire, and the U.S., began a counteroffensive on 9 July. Faya-Largeau was recaptured on 30 July. The next day Libyan MIG fighter-bombers attacked Faya-Largeau, the first undisguised and direct Libyan intervention in Chad's civil war. This act triggered a crisis for France. French President Mitterand responded on 6 August with an order to activate "Operation Manta," designed to oust Libya from Faya-Largeau and, more generally, to weaken its influence in the internal affairs of Chad. Three days later, several hundred French troops were dispatched to Chad's capital from the Central African Republic, triggering a crisis for Libya. Although France--and Libya--wanted to avoid a confrontation between their forces, France threatened Libya on 25 August that it would not accept Libya's control over Faya-Largeau.  Peace talks among all the rival Chad factions, sponsored by the OAU, were held in November 1983, but deadlock ensued. An OAU reconciliation conference in Addis Ababa also failed in mid-January. In January 1984 the smoldering crisis became more acute when a French plane was shot down by Chad rebel forces. France responded by strengthening its military presence in Chad. On 10 March an Air France plane was damaged at N'Djamena airport.  The "winding down" of Chad/Libya VI was slow to crystallize. On 30 April Qaddhafi presented a mutual withdrawal proposal, which was accepted by France. However, it took five months to implement this de facto agreement. On 17 September 1984 Qaddhafi and French President Mitterand met and announced that mutual withdrawal of all their forces in Chad would begin on 25 September and be completed by 10 November, the termination date for Chad's and Libya's crisis. France met the withdrawal deadline. However, Qaddhafi did not adhere to the agreement fully: France accused him on 5 December of leaving 3,000 troops in northern Chad. By the 11th tension had eased sufficiently so that France's crisis over Chad--and the international crisis of which it was a part--came to an end. Mitterand renewed France's commitment to Chad's independence, while recognizing the de facto partition of Chad at the 16th Parallel into Libyan and French spheres of influence.  The USSR, as usual, provided political support for Libya. The UN role was limited to discussion. Mediation efforts, primarily facilitative mediation on the part of the OAU and Congo, seemed to have little effect on crisis abatement.  (In addition to its persistent involvement in crises with Chad, Libya was also enmeshed in crises with other African neighbors [see Cases #311--Raid on Gafsa, in 1980; #314--Libyan Threat-Sadat, in 1980; #318--Libyan Intervention in The Gambia, in 1980; and #340--Libyan Threat to Sudan, in 1983, in Africa: Non-PCs].)
The United States and Grenada were enmeshed in a brief military intervention crisis from 19 to 28 October 1983. Grenada, a long-time British colony in the Caribbean, became a self-governing state, with full internal autonomy, in March 1967. The first general election, that year, brought the Grenada United Labor Party (GULP) to power, with its leader, Eric M. Gairy, as Prime Minister. Gairy ruled the island with an iron hand until 1979, opposed by two groups of young professionals and intellectuals: the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education, and Liberation (JEWEL); and the Movement for Assemblies of the People (MAP). These merged into the New Jewel Movement (NJM) in March 1973, the advocate of pragmatic nationalism and a radical populist alternative to Gairy and the GULP.  Grenada was granted independence on 7 February 1974. The widespread political unrest and civil disturbances of the preindependence period continued unabated. GULP won a bare majority in the 1976 general election; and Maurice Bishop, a founder of the MAP, became leader of the parliamentary opposition, now integrated into the United People's Party. A successful coup in March 1979 brought the marxist NJM to power, headed by Prime Minister Bishop and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bernard Coard. The new People's Revolutionary Government created a one-party system, suspended the constitution, and banned the opposition. It also rapidly expanded Grenada's diplomatic network beyond the Caribbean and its mentor, Castro's Cuba, to the Soviet Union and many socialist Third World states.  Washington had long regarded the Caribbean as a region of vital importance and an area of U.S. hegemony, in accordance with the Monroe Doctrine (1823) dictum against any European intervention in the Western Hemisphere. Thus the USSR's perceived influence on the left-wing regime in Grenada, via Cuba, was a source of concern. This was accentuated by the construction of a large airport on the island, capable of handling large civilian and military planes. U.S. perceptions of an increasingly hostile regime in the United States' "backyard" were further aggravated by a week-long tour of East European capitals by Prime Minister Bishop, followed by two days of talks in Havana in early October 1983. Soon after, factional disunity within the Grenada regime erupted. Prime Minister Bishop, a pragmatist, favored rapprochement with the U.S., while his hard-line deputy sought a close alignment with the Soviet bloc.  On 14 October Coard was forced to resign for an alleged plot to assassinate Bishop. However, three days later a coup in Grenada deposed the prime minister, and Coard took power. Bishop and five other ministers were placed under house arrest by General Hudson Austin, commander of the People's Revolutionary Army.  Long before the coup there had been speculation in Grenada that the U.S. was planning some form of military intervention, especially after President Reagan, on 23 March 1983, described the island's regime as a "threat to the security of the United States." Washington had expressed anxiety over Cuban participation in the construction of the Point Salinas international airport, viewing it as a potential military base for Soviet-bloc forces in the Americas. Relations between the U.S. and Grenada had been further strained by the growing tension between the Reagan administration and the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, especially after joint U.S.-Honduras military maneuvers in August. On 19 October 1983 Bishop was freed by supporters but was quickly recaptured; in the firing that ensued, an estimated 200 persons were killed or wounded by Austin's troops. Soon after, Bishop and seven cabinet ministers and trade union leaders were executed. This act and a 96-hour curfew, imposed by Grenada's military authorities, triggered a crisis for the U.S.: Washington perceived a threat to its influence in the Caribbean and Central America, along with potential harm to U.S. citizens living in Grenada, about 1,000, mostly university students.  A Revolutionary Military Council (RMC), headed by General Austin, was formed on 20 October. The RMC gave repeated assurances for the safety of foreign nationals, opened the airport, and allowed them to leave. However, the dramatic and radical shift of power in Grenada triggered a sharp response. At an emergency session of the Organization of East Caribbean States (OECS) held on the 21st, a decision was made to impose immediate diplomatic and economic sanctions against Grenada's military regime and to "take appropriate action" to ensure the defense and security of the subregion. The OECS approached the U.S. for assistance. The same day a U.S. naval task force, including the assault ship Guam and led by the aircraft carrier Independence, was diverted to the Caribbean, ostensibly for the possible evacuation of U.S. citizens. This triggered a crisis for the new military regime in Grenada.  At an emergency meeting of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) heads of government on 22-23 October a decision was taken to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions against Grenada, similar to, but geographically more wide-ranging than, those agreed to at the subregional (OECS) level. On the 23rd, in another, distant, international crisis, the headquarters of U.S. marines in Lebanon was bombed, with more than 200 fatalities. That night, partly under the stress of the Lebanon crisis, Reagan decided to respond to the urgent request of the OECS: final military plans were made for an invasion. On the 24th the curfew imposed by Grenada's RMC was lifted, and the airport was opened for anyone who wanted to leave the island.  Early in the morning of 25 October 1,900 U.S. troops landed in Grenada, followed shortly after by a contingent of 300 soldiers from Jamaica, Barbados, Dominica, Antigua, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, to serve as a Caribbean Peacekeeping Force. Resistance by troops loyal to Grenada's RMC, supported by some Cuban construction workers on the island, was more intense than had been anticipated. By the 28th all the major military objectives of the U.S.-led multinational force had been secured. This ended the crisis for both the U.S. and Grenada.  Nicaragua asked the UN Security Council on 25 October for an urgent meeting to consider "the invasion of the Republic of Grenada by United States troops." A draft resolution was vetoed by the U.S. in the Security Council on the 27th. The USSR condemned U.S. intervention in Grenada.  (Coard and Austin were captured on the 31st. Final pockets of RMC resistance were quelled by 3 November. The governor-general formed an interim administration on the 15th to pave the way for a return to democracy. U.S. forces handed the task of maintaining internal security to the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force on 22 November. And by mid-December all U.S. combat troops had been withdrawn.)
Botswana experienced a crisis with Zimbabwe (the successor to Rhodesia) from 8 November to 21 December 1983. Two Zimbabwean political forces competed for power in the struggle against the white colonial regime in Rhodesia: the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), under the leadership of Robert Mugabe; and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), led by Joshua Nkomo. The former won a decisive majority in the February 1980 elections preparatory to independence.  Authority was transferred to ZANU on 18 April 1980, with Mugabe as Prime Minister, later as President of the new state (see Case #307--Rhodesia Settlement, in Rhodesia PC). However, rivalry, including frequent clashes, continued during the early years of independence, largely due to the ZANU-led government's attempt to extend central authority to the ZAPU's territorial base, Metabeleland. Some of the latter's forces sought--and received--sanctuary in neighboring Botswana, notably at the Dukwe refugee camp. In a "hot pursuit" operation against the alleged dissident training camp, a small contingent of Zimbabwean forces penetrated four kilometers into Botswana near Maitengwe on 8 November 1983. Minor clashes with Botswana border guards triggered a foreign policy crisis for Zimbabwe's much weaker neighbor. Botswana responded by strengthening several border posts and by requesting an urgent meeting of their Joint Defense and Security Commission. The Zimbabwe minister of state tried to reassure Botswana of its peaceful intentions at the commission's meeting on 10 November.  A second incident occurred on 20 December, with Zimbabwe acknowledging for the first time that its forces had intruded into Botswana. The crisis was defused as a result of a meeting between senior officials of the two states on the 21st.  There was no involvement by the U.S., the USSR, the UN, or the OAU. Maitengwe was a low-intensity crisis, with minor violence, a spillover from the internal politics of Zimbabwe in the pre- and early post-independence years.
Sudan perceived a crisis with Ethiopia from 20 November 1983 to 20 February 1984. A protracted civil war between the Muslim-led government in the north and predominantly Christian forces in the south had created havoc and made Sudan vulnerable to external intervention. The internal situation deteriorated in May 1983 following Khartoum's attempts to weaken the south, through an imposed administrative division of the south into three zones and the rotation of southern army units to the north, along with the exploitation of newly discovered oil in the south for the benefit of the north. The result was mutiny in the army and mass desertions of southern soldiers, and a sharpening of civil strife.  In September 1983 President Numeiri accused Ethiopia, Iran, Libya, and the USSR of plotting against his regime. On 15 November 11 foreign workers and 18 Sudanese were kidnapped by rebel forces based in Ethiopia. Two days later Sudan claimed that these rebel forces had attacked southern Sudan. The crisis trigger for Sudan was an alleged massing of 1,000 Ethiopian troops on its border, supported by 150 Cuban and Soviet advisors, financed by Libya. This "foreign conspiracy" was denounced on 20 November by Sudan's First Vice-President, General Omar Mohamed Al-Taib. The same day Sudan proclaimed a state of emergency and placed its armed forces on a state of maximum alert. In a delayed reaction, President Mengistu of Ethiopia denied Sudan's allegations on 24 January 1984, as did Ethiopia's foreign minister in Paris, claiming that the situation on the border was "very calm."  Sudan claimed on 19 December that its forces had broken the siege of Nasir, about 30 kilometers from the border. Tension and low-intensity conflict persisted until 20 February when Sudan's foreign minister announced unilateral steps to end its hostile verbal campaign against Ethiopia as a goodwill gesture. This marked the termination of Sudan's crisis with its neighbor.  The U.S., the UN, and the OAU were not involved. The USSR, as noted, was accused by Sudan of a "Kremlin plan" to undermine Sudan's territorial integrity and political stability.
Angola experienced another crisis with the Union of South Africa from 6 December 1983 until 16 February 1984. On 6 December 1983 the South Africa Defence Forces launched their most formidable invasion of southern Angola since Operation Protea in 1981 (see Case #331): they attacked targets more than 150 miles inside Angola. According to a Pretoria spokesman, the aim of the operation was to disrupt preparations by SWAPO guerrillas for their annual incursions into South-West Africa.  Serious clashes continued throughout December around the towns of Cubama, Caiundo, and Cassinga, with the most intense fighting early in January at Curelai, where South African troops clashed not only with SWAPO, but also with Angolan and Cuban forces. Angola responded to the crisis with military resistance and with a complaint to the UN Security Council that South Africa had committed aggression against its territory, requesting an emergency session of the Council.  The Council adopted a resolution on 20 December 1983: it censured South Africa for its military operations in Angola and demanded the SADF's unconditional withdrawal from Angola.  The winding down of this international crisis began soon after its eruption. South Africa's Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, put forward proposals for a cease-fire in Angola on 15 December, to take effect at the end of January 1984. President dos Santos responded on 30 December with a conditional acceptance. On 20 January 1984 talks were held in Cape Verde among Angolan, South African, and UN representatives. While South Africa had only claimed to be observing at Cape Verde, secretive trilateral mediation efforts had begun on the previous day among the U.S., Angola and South Africa. The U.S. and Angola came to an agreement, the Act of Sao Vicente, in which Angola agreed to control SWAPO once South Africa withdrew from Angola. The U.S. delegation had been headed by Frank Wisner, who reported the successful negotiations to his superior, Chester Crocker, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. On 26 January Crocker flew to Cape Town with a "special message" from the Angolan government. On 27 January, he met with Prime Minister Botha, who then announced to the South African Parliament that he had ordered a complete SADF withdrawal from Angola on the 31st.  Angola's President dos Santos met with Zambia's President Kaunda on 6 February. Ten days later, on 16 February, Angolan and South African delegations, with Crocker and Kaunda directing the proceedings, reached the "Lusaka Agreement" to establish a joint monitoring commission to supervise the withdrawal of South African troops from Angola which, in return, undertook not to permit SWAPO forces to move into Namibia. This marked the end of Angola's crisis and, with it, the end of Operation Askari.  Both of the superpowers were politically active in this crisis. As noted, the U.S. was influential in brokering the Lusaka Agreement between South Africa and Angola. The USSR, on 5 January 1984, called for concerted international action to halt South Africa's "aggression" against Angola. Later that month it warned Pretoria of the logical consequences of its behavior, without specifying any likely Soviet action beyond support for Angola. On 11 January military delegations from Angola, Cuba, and the USSR reached an agreement in Moscow on strengthening Angola's defenses.
During the third phase of the Iran/Iraq War (1980-88) Iraq and Iran, along with Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia, experienced a fresh crisis from 21 February to 11 July 1984. The year 1983 witnessed several inconclusive attacks and counterattacks by the two protagonists in the war. The first was a major Iranian offensive in the area of Misan west of Dezful on 7 February (Wal Fajr I) but the initiative quickly petered out. Iraq counterattacked in late March but made no progress. A fresh Iranian offensive from 10-17 April, aimed at capturing the heights along the front north of Fuka, was indecisive. Iraq responded with air strikes on Iranian civilian targets in May and sought a cease-fire, without success. On 23 July Iran launched another offensive and advanced 15 kilometers within Iraq.  Iran's strategy of attrition was designed to exert pressure on the weakening Iraqi economy with the aim of toppling the Saddam Hussein regime. Wal Fajr IV, from 30 July to 10 August 1983, aimed at clearing the heights above Mehran. Iraq responded with more intense missile and air raids on Iranian towns and oil installations--and the use of mustard gas against Iranian troops. A major target was Iran's oil export installations on Kharg Island. Iran countered with attacks on shipping in the Gulf. However, none of these attacks in 1983 achieved the goal of a decisive defeat of the enemy's forces. In February 1984 Iran launched four separate attacks on Iraqi forces, one in the north on the 12th near Nowdeshah, the other three in the south. It was Wal Fajr VI, launched on 21 February near Dehloran and aimed at cutting the vital Basra-Baghdad road, that triggered an intra-war crisis for Iraq. However, as was often the case in the Iran/Iraq War, it turned into a battle of attrition: Iran's sole victory was the conquest of the oil drilling complex on Majnoon Island, the site of rich oil fields in southern Iraq.  Iraq responded with a major attack on Iranian oil installations on Kharg Island on 1 March 1984 triggering an IWC for Iran. The latter's "Operation Badr" from 11 to 23 March, designed to capture Basra or cut it off from the rest of Iraq, reached the Basra-Baghdad road. Perceiving a threat of grave damage if Iranian forces succeeded, Iraq committed an elite Republican Guard division and its air force to the defense of Basra. By the 18th they recaptured all of Iraq's lost positions.  Kuwait became a crisis actor on 13 May 1984 when one of its tankers, transporting oil to the U.K., was damaged near Bahrain. Another Kuwaiti tanker was hit the following day. Kuwait accused Iran of the hostile acts. Iran responded that, if the passage to and from Kharg Island was not safe, no other routes in the Gulf would be secure. Sa'udi Arabia became a direct participant in the Basra-Kharg Island crisis as a result of the "tanker war": one of its ships was set ablaze on 16 May by Iranian aircraft firing within Sa'udi territorial waters north of the port of al-Jubay.  Kuwait's response to Iran's attacks was a request on 30 May for U.S. Stinger antiaircraft missiles, along with a U.S. naval escort for its tankers. Sa'udi Arabia responded militarily on 5 June: Sa'udi F-15s, assisted by U.S. advanced early-warning (AWACS) reconnaissance planes, shot down an Iranian F-4 fighter.  Crisis termination occurred on different dates for the four actors. As noted, Iraq's intra-war crisis ended on 18 March when it succeeded in thwarting Iran's attempt to capture Basra or to isolate that city from the rest of the country. Iran's IWC ended on 10 June when it agreed with Iraq to a moratorium on the shelling of civilian areas, brokered by the UN Secretary-General. On 20 June Sa'udi Arabia created an air defense zone, blocking further Iranian incursions into its airspace and ending its crisis. And Kuwait's crisis ended on 11 July, when it signed an arms deal with the USSR. This marked the end of the Basra-Kharg Island crisis as a whole; but the war continued unabated for another four years.  As in earlier phases of the Iran/Iraq War, all attempts to end the war--by the UN, the Gulf states, the Non-Aligned Movement, and various Islamic organizations--failed, though, as noted, the UN Secretary-General arranged a brief moratorium on the bombing of civilian areas.  France continued to be a major arms supplier to Iraq, whose war effort was heavily financed by Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia. The U.S. goal throughout Gulf War I was to keep the Strait of Hormuz open to the steady flow of oil to its allies in Europe and Japan. Secretly it provided Iraq with valuable technological assistance and intelligence information throughout the war, and antiaircraft missiles and a naval escort for Sa'udi ships. The USSR provided arms to Iraq, notably SS-12 ground-to-ground missiles. Other suppliers of military equipment to Iraq were Egypt, Brazil, China, and Chile.  Except for Syria, the Arab world supported Iraq: both the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League condemned Iran. And the latter sought UN intervention. On 21 May 1984 the Security Council adopted a resolution calling on all parties to respect freedom of navigation in the Gulf. By late August both superpowers shifted their stance from apparent impartiality to open support for Iraq.
Greece experienced a two-day crisis with Turkey in the Aegean Sea from 8 to 10 March 1984. Following the first Aegean Sea crisis in 1976, Greece and Turkey signed an agreement in Berne, Switzerland, undertaking not to search for oil outside their territorial waters. But the boundary dispute remained unresolved. In the context of their enduring rivalry both Greece and Turkey were predisposed to perceive any act by their long-time adversary as threatening. The catalyst to Greece's 1984 crisis was a report from Greek intelligence that one of its warships was fired on by five Turkish destroyers in the northeast Aegean Sea on 8 March 1984. Following an emergency meeting of the Greek cabinet, Prime Minister Papandreou declared that this was the worst Turkish provocation since the massive invasion of Cyprus in 1974 (see Case #257). Greece responded the following day by placing its armed forces on alert and by recalling its ambassador from Ankara.  In an attempt to reduce the tension Turkey's embassy in Washington asserted the same day that Turkish warships were engaged in artillery maneuvers when a Greek warship and civilian vessel entered the firing zone. Turkey's prime minister also reported that Greece had been informed 15 days earlier of Turkey's planned naval exercise. The next day, 10 March, the Turkish stand was endorsed by the NATO ambassadors meeting in emergency session.  The winding down of this crisis was swifter and much less painful than earlier eruptions in the Greece/Turkey protracted conflict. On 10 March Greece announced that it had concluded Turkish warships had not intentionally fired on the Greek destroyer in the Aegean. It canceled the recall of its ambassador to Turkey and its planned military alert, thereby terminating the crisis with Turkey.  There was no UN or USSR activity in this crisis. The U.S. was involved only indirectly, through NATO.
Sudan, Egypt, and Libya were the direct participants in a brief crisis, beginning on 16 March 1984; the crisis faded. Throughout its lengthy tenure (1969-85) the Numeiri military regime in Sudan viewed Libya and Ethiopia, aided by the USSR, as engaged in persistent subversion to undermine its hold on power in Khartoum. On two previous occasions Libya's acts and Sudan's perceptions led to international crises (see Cases #340 and #346). On 16 March 1984 a sole Tupolev (TU-22) bomber attacked the twin city of Sudan's capital, Omdurman. This triggered a crisis for Sudan--and Egypt, the latter because of its commitments under their 1976 mutual defense agreement. On the 17th Sudan's military regime immediately placed its armed forces on alert. The same day Egypt dispatched senior army officers to Khartoum as a signal of its concern and support. Both accused Libya of responsibility for the raid, a charge that it denied.  In response to a request by Sudan and Egypt the U.S. dispatched two AWACS surveillance aircraft on 18 March, triggering a crisis for Libya. Four days later Libya requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which met on 27-28 March. As in February 1983 (see Case #340), Sudan accused Libya of the raid and, more generally, of intervention in its affairs; and Libya charged the U.S. with acts of aggression. As in the earlier crisis, too, President Mubarak of Egypt went to Khartoum on 25 March in a gesture of solidarity with the Numeiri regime. Thousands of Egyptian soldiers were by then deployed in Sudan. No finite end to this crisis can be identified.  The U.S., as noted, actively supported Sudan and Egypt. The USSR provided passive backing to Libya. The UN did not play an active role in crisis management. And the two regional organizations, the OAU and the Arab League, remained aloof.
Thailand alone experienced a crisis from 25 March to 17 April 1984 arising from a Vietnamese incursion into its territory. Relations between Vietnam and Cambodia (Kampuchea) have always been characterized by hostility and rivalry. Vietnam has long perceived itself as the rightful hegemonial power in Indochina and viewed its neighbors, Cambodia and Laos, as tributaries (or client states). During the era of French domination, through protectorates over Cambodia (1863), Vietnam (1874), and Laos (1893), overt conflict among the three colonial peoples was prevented by external domination. The members of France's Indochina Union became independent following its defeat in the first stage of the long Vietnam War (1946-1954)--Laos, Cambodia, and the two Vietnams, the communist North Vietnam, with its capital in Hanoi, and the anti-communist South, centered in Saigon. During the second stage of the Vietnam War (1964-75), Kampuchea was at times a junior ally of Hanoi, at other times a U.S. base for operations against Vietnam.  Their traditional conflict erupted into a lengthy crisis in September 1977, culminating in full-scale war from 15 December 1978 to 7 January 1979, when Vietnam installed a puppet regime in Kampuchea's capital, Phnom Penh (see Case #284--Vietnam Invasion of Cambodia, in Indochina PC). In that case Thailand was a secondary crisis actor. Thus the crisis generated by Vietnam's incursion into Thailand in March 1984 was an extension of the protracted conflict between Vietnam and Cambodia. A crisis was triggered for Thailand on 25 March 1984 by the intrusion of Vietnamese troops into its territory in pursuit of Khmer Rouge Cambodian rebels: Vietnam's cross-border raid, along with Thai military and civilian casualties, was perceived as seriously undermining Thailand's security.  Bangkok responded quickly along two paths: a military effort to force the Vietnamese back into Kampuchea; and a diplomatic offensive in both Washington and the UN. The first included minor clashes in the area of the Khmer Rouge camp, the Chong Phra Palai Pass linking Kampuchea and Thailand. The second led to tangible U.S. support.  Initially Washington announced an offer of military aid to Thailand on 15 April. Two days later, following a meeting with the Thai Premier, General Prem Tinsulanonda, President Reagan reaffirmed the sale of 40 M-48 tanks to "bolster the nation's defenses," along with an assurance of further military sales, as needed. That visible expression of support from a superpower terminated Thailand's crisis.  Unlike the U.S., which took an active role, the USSR, an ally of North Vietnam, remained aloof. The UN, though approached by Thailand and notwithstanding its earlier resolution calling for the withdrawal of Vietnam from Kampuchea, played a minor role in this crisis. One regional organization, the six-state Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN), supported Thailand, a member, by writing a letter to the UN condemning Vietnam's unprovoked violation of Thailand's border.
Vietnam and China were enmeshed in a crisis from 2 April until the second half of June 1984. A crisis for Vietnam was triggered by Chinese long-range shelling from across the border in Yunnan Province and the Guangxi autonomous region, beginning on 2 April 1984. This attack coincided with Vietnam's military offensive near Kampuchea's (Cambodia's) border with Thailand. Two days later Vietnam's foreign minister accused China of a calculated act to put pressure on Vietnam from two sides. China denied the linkage and termed its action a response to Vietnam's "provocations." On 6 April Chinese forces penetrated deep into Vietnam, to a point only 150 kilometers from Hanoi. On the 8th Hanoi Radio acknowledged heavy casualties and accused Beijing of an act of war, reflecting China's expansionist aims. The same day the PRC's foreign minister responded in kind, claiming that Vietnam forces crossed the frontier into Yunnan on 5 April. On the 12th Vietnam dismissed this charge as "nonsense."  During the month of April 1984 both sides claimed that incidents occurred almost daily, with heavy casualties for the other side. A major border clash was reported on 28 April, the probable trigger to China's crisis. Beijing accused Vietnam of invading the Loashan area; Vietnam denied the charge. However, on 3 May a Vietnam defense ministry spokesman told a press conference that Vietnam had succeeded in stopping a Chinese invasion from 28 April to 1 May.  Another serious border clash occurred on 15 May. Again, both sides claimed victory, with heavy casualties suffered by the enemy. Low-intensity violence continued through May and much of June. The crisis faded in the latter part of June.  There was no direct involvement by either superpower in this crisis; but both were exploited by the adversaries. The U.S. president's visit to China from 26 April to 1 May 1984 was noted in a critical vein by Vietnam: on 1 May Hanoi Radio linked the 28 April border clash, the peak of Sino/Vietnamese tension and hostilities, to President Reagan's presence in Beijing. The USSR, too, was involved on the periphery--by its client's adversary: on 8 May China criticized Moscow for a display of military support for Vietnam, a landing exercise by 400 Soviet sailors on the Vietnamese coast 145 kilometers from Haiphong. Vietnam complained to the UN, but the world body remained aloof.
Thailand and Laos experienced the first of two crises over a disputed border from 5 June until mid-October 1984 (see Case #381). Laos, a landlocked state in Indochina, was traditionally dependent on Thailand for its imports of vital goods and for its foreign trade generally. During the final phase of the prolonged Vietnam War the geopolitics of Indochina were transformed: in 1975 Laos became a communist state, the Laos People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), and a client of the regional superpower, the triumphant, united Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). The signing by Laos of a defense cooperation agreement with Vietnam in 1977 escalated the ever-present low-level tension between Laos and Thailand. There were, too, sporadic minor clashes between them over border delineations since 1975.  The dispute between Thailand and Laos that generated their 1984 and 1987-88 crises (see Case #381) centered on the location of three border villages--Ban Mai, Ban Kang, and Ban Savang, with an area of 19 square kilometers and a population of 1,000. Both states accepted the watershed principle of border demarcation but disagreed about where the watershed lay vis-à-vis the Mekong and Me Nam Chao Phraya Rivers.  The dispute derived from ambiguity in the Franco-Siam treaty of 1907, which defined the border in the disputed area as the Hoeng River. The ambiguity was due to the fact that the river had two tributaries: Laos took one as the demarcation, Thailand the other. The territorial dispute was accentuated by the settling of Thai communist guerrillas in two of these villages. Moreover, Thai construction teams began building a road through the disputed area, leading to clashes with Laotian militiamen. Until early June 1984 both parties seemed willing to allow local officials to settle their boundary dispute. However, on 5 June, according to the Thais, Laotians moved wooden border markers into the villages, asserting an explicit claim: this was perceived as a threat and triggered a crisis for Thailand. The next day Thai troops moved into the villages to expel the Laotians, triggering a crisis for the LPDR. Laotian troops responded in kind, and minor clashes ensued for several days.  By the 9th Laos decided in favor of crisis management via diplomacy and so informed the Thai ambassador in Vientiane. With the military situation stalemated, Thailand, on 15 July, proposed negotiations between the two interior ministers. The LPDR accepted on the 17th, thereby terminating Thailand's crisis: as the state in occupation of the disputed territory, it no longer perceived a threat or time pressure or the likelihood of military hostilities.  Two rounds of negotiations, on 21-23 July and 6-15 August, ended in deadlock. Thus Laos's crisis lingered until mid-October, when Thailand agreed to withdraw its troops from the three villages and to cease construction in the disputed area. The outcome was a compromise, for neither party achieved all of its goals. In terms of values, the crisis was asymmetrical: for Laos, it was perceived as a serious threat to territorial integrity; for Thailand, it was a low value threat.  Both superpowers remained aloof, as did the regional organizations, SEATO and ASEAN. Only the UN was involved. Laos submitted the dispute to the Security Council. However, the Council's debate on 22 October 1984 indicated sympathy for Thailand's contention that Laos had instigated the crisis to undermine its (successful) campaign for a seat in the Council.
Botswana experienced a crisis with the Union of South Africa from 14 to 21 June 1985. From 1978 until 1988 South Africa used its superior military power to launch frequent raids against neighboring states--some at the level of full-scale invasion--alleging that Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were providing sanctuaries for African National Congress (ANC) fighters. Most of these incursions were directed at Angola ( Case #323; and Case #380 in Angola PC).  On 16 March 1984 the Nkomati Accord between Mozambique and South Africa neutralized the former as a sanctuary for the ANC. Pretoria, concerned that the ANC would move its bases from Mozambique to Botswana, pressed Botswana to sign a similar agreement; but it refused. Botswana accused South Africa of applying economic, as well as military and political, pressure. In September 1984 South Africa reiterated that it would take whatever action was necessary to ensure its security. On 14 June 1985 the SADF launched a raid on 10 alleged centers of ANC guerrillas in the capital of Botswana, Gaborne. Botswana denied the charge. In protest, the U.S. recalled its ambassador from Pretoria. The U.K. protested to South Africa's ambassador in London. India and other members of the Non-Aligned Movement denounced the raid. So too did the OAU and the UN Secretary-General.  Most visible in this chorus of criticism was the UN Security Council. In its Resolution 568 passed on 21 June, the Council unanimously condemned South Africa's act and demanded that it pay "full and adequate compensation." This ended the crisis for Botswana--but not South Africa's ubiquitous raids.  The USSR was not involved.  (The next day, Pretoria threatened to invade Botswana if it did not change its policy toward the ANC. And on 19 May 1986 it launched another raid against Botswana, as well as Zambia and Zimbabwe [see Case #365].)
Tunisia experienced a crisis with Libya from 21 August to 26 September 1985 over the mass expulsion of Tunisians. The relations between these two North African Arab neighbors were chronically unstable. Since the Raid on Gafsa (see Case #311), there was an improvement, especially between the summer of 1984 and the spring of 1985. As a result, a cooperation agreement was signed between them at the end of December 1984, covering trade, security, industry, employment, and culture. Nonetheless, because of declining oil revenues and a costly development program, Libya decided to expel 38,000 foreign workers in August 1985, of whom 30,000 were Tunisians. Tunisia protested this unilateral act. Qaddhafi tried to pressure Tunisia into a political union. On 18 August Tunisia accused Libya of violating its airspace: it closed the Libyan cultural center, news agency, and airline in Tunis, expelled 253 Libyans who were accused of threatening its internal and external security, and declared 30 Libyan diplomats persona non grata. On 21 August 1985 Libya accused Tunisia of participating in an "imperialist" anti-Libya plot, triggering a crisis for its neighbor. A buildup of Libyan troops near the border with Tunisia--and Egypt--was reported. The next day Tunisian forces were placed on alert, to prevent a possible attack by Libya. On the 23rd and again on 31 August and 23 September, Tunisia accused Libya of violating its airspace and of preparing for war. It also summoned home the remaining Tunisian migrant workers in Libya.  On 26 September Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with Libya and announced the suspension of air traffic between the two countries. This terminated Tunisia's crisis; but relations with Libya remained strained.  The Arab League and, independently, Morocco and Kuwait tried to mediate the crisis, without success. The U.S. on 26 August, and Algeria's president during a visit to Tunisia on 2 September, announced their support of Tunisia's territorial integrity. Moreover, the U.S. made an effort to mediate in the crisis and had a marginal effect at reducing tensions. Neither the USSR nor the UN was involved in this crisis.  (Ten years later, in September 1995, another exodus from Libya occurred: Qaddhafi publicly acknowledged that he was expelling thousands of Palestinians from Libya--to punish PLO leaders for agreeing to limited self-rule, in negotiations with Israel. Attempted mediation by Egypt was not successful.)
Syria and Israel were embroiled in the second crisis over the Biqa (see Case #327) from 19 November 1985 to 15 January 1986. The Israel Air Force (IAF) has been conducting regular reconnaissance flights over Lebanon since the mid-1970s. These were accepted by Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon, in the 1976 "Red Line" agreement, which governed Israeli/Syrian military relations vis-à-vis Lebanon until the outbreak of the Lebanon War in 1982 (see Case #337). Although incidents did occur--sometimes Israeli planes, at other times Syrian planes, withdrew to avoid a direct military confrontation--this U.S.-brokered agreement maintained relative stability in a volatile region. According to the commander of the IAF at the time, Syria attempted to interfere with Israel's reconnaissance flights over Lebanon on several occasions in November 1985. On 19 November 1985 two Syrian MIG aircraft were shot down by two Israeli planes over Lebanon; according to Israel, this occurred after Syrian fighters threatened Israeli planes on reconnaissance missions over Lebanon. This incident, very common in the Israeli/Syrian protracted conflict, triggered a crisis for Syria.  Tension rose on 24 November when Syria responded by deploying SAM-6 missiles in the Biqa (Bekaa) Valley and along the Beirut-Damascus road. However, those missiles were soon withdrawn following U.S. pressure.  Israel's crisis was triggered on 15 December, when Syria redeployed SAM-6 and SAM-8 missiles close to the Lebanon border. Israel reacted the same day by accusing Syria of also deploying long-range SAM-2 missiles in southwestern Syria, posing a threat to mutually agreed Israeli reconnaissance missions over Lebanon. The Syrian government claimed on 16 December that the redeployment was a defensive move. Israel, in turn, through Defense Minister Rabin, warned on 27 December that the IDF would respond to the threatening missiles "whatever the cost."  Tension between the two long-time adversaries declined in early January 1986 as a result of U.S. mediation that succeeded in devising an acceptable resolution framework: Syria agreed not to interfere with IAF reconnaissance missions; and Israel agreed not to attack Syrian missile sites as long as they did not threaten Israeli reconnaissance flights over Lebanon.  On 15 January the IAF announced that Syria's long-range missiles had been withdrawn from Lebanon. That Syrian act ended the crisis for both states.
Egypt and Libya were enmeshed in a crisis from 23 November to 3 December 1985. Tension between these North African neighbors had existed for more than a decade. Libya's Colonel Qaddhafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969, was an ardent Nasirite and considered himself the successor to Egypt's charismatic leader when he died in 1970. Relations between Qaddhafi and President Sadat of Egypt, during his tenure from 1970 to 1981, were, at best, distant: they differed on ideology, policies toward the U.S. and the USSR, attitudes toward the legitimacy of political terrorism, and peace with Israel. Relations with President Mubarak, who continued Sadat's policies in all these domains, were no better: the Libyan leader's mercurial behavior and his image as inspirer, protector, and supporter of militant antiestablishment groups within and outside the Arab world fostered mistrust and instability in the Egypt/Libya relationship. A crisis for Egypt was triggered on 23 November 1985 by an air piracy incident: five members of an anti-Mubarak group, "Egypt Revolution," took control of an Egypt Air flight from Athens to Cairo, with 92 passengers. One of the hijackers was killed and an Egyptian security guard was wounded in an exchange of fire during the flight. Egypt and several Western states condemned Libya for giving active support to the terrorists, who were thought to be members of the anti-Arafat "Al-Fatah Revolutionary Command," headed by Abu Nidal. Egypt put its armed forces on alert, along with a military buildup on its border with Libya, triggering its crisis.  The plane landed in Malta, despite the refusal of its civil aviation authorities to authorize a landing. The hijackers demanded that the plane be refueled; but Malta's Prime Minister, Dr. Carmelo Bonnici, insisted that all passengers first be released. The hijackers set the West European, North American, Australian, and Israeli passport holders apart from the rest and shot some of them, killing one person.  Egypt's major response to its crisis was an antiterrorist military operation. On the 24th, 75 Egyptian commando troops were secretly dispatched to the airport in Malta; three U.S. officers joined the Egyptian force. That evening they stormed the plane. During the fighting and fire that ensued, about 60 people were killed.  The U.S., the U.K., and Israel supported the Egyptian rescue mission. Malta's prime minister declared that he supported the assault because the hijackers continued to shoot hostages and threatened to blow up the plane in midair. The Greek ambassador protested to Malta's foreign minister on the 26th for not consulting Athens before allowing the Egyptian rescue mission, since a large number of passengers were Greek nationals. The same day, President Mubarak claimed that the leader of the hijacking group was living in a Tripoli hotel. Egypt requested the extradition of the one surviving hijacker; but this was denied, in the absence of an extradition treaty between Egypt and Malta.  Despite rumors of an impending Egyptian attack on Libya, tension eased. And on 3 December Mubarak declared that it was impossible for Egypt to "fight an Arab or African brother." This terminated the crisis with Libya.  There was no UN, Arab League, or OAU involvement in this crisis. The U.S. was active on the periphery of the rescue mission. And the USSR confined its activity to verbal criticism of the charges of Libyan complicity in the hijacking.
Mali and Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, experienced a second crisis over the Agacher Strip from 20 December 1985 to 18 January 1986. The Agacher area between these two West African states, reputewdly rich in minerals, was in dispute since both were granted independence by France in 1960. In 1979 the parties agreed on procedures to resolve their dispute. By September 1985 a joint border commission had succeeded in demarcating 1,000 kilometers of their common border. However, relations became badly strained a month earlier when Burkina Faso expelled the Secretary-General of the Francophone West African Economic Community, a Malian, because he criticized the President of Burkina Faso. (Captain Thomas Sankara, who became President of Upper Volta in 1983, changed its name to Burkina Faso in 1984.) The crisis trigger was a non-violent act by Burkina Faso around 20 December 1985--an attempt to conduct a census in the Agacher region under police guard. This led to violent incidents, which escalated on the 25th, when Mali troops attacked towns within the disputed area. Burkina Faso planes and soldiers penetrated deep into Mali territory on the 26th. Four days of serious clashes left an estimated 400 persons dead. A cease-fire was achieved on the 30th through Nigerian and Libyan mediation under OAU auspices and took effect the next day, monitored by a small (16-person) Observer Group from the states of the Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement and Benin. Moreover, the parties, who had agreed in principle to submit the border dispute to the International Court of Justice in September 1983, did so in December 1985.  Crisis termination was achieved at a multistate conference in the Ivory Coast on 17-18 January: the two protagonists agreed to withdraw their forces from the disputed territory, thereby terminating the crisis.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis. The OAU, as noted, played an indirect mediating role. The UN Secretary-General appealed to the two parties on 27 December 1985 to exercise maximum restraint; and he offered good offices to the OAU.
Lesotho experienced another crisis with the Union of South Africa from 20 December 1985 to 25 January 1986. The Pretoria regime's regional goal during the 1980s was nonaggression pacts with its neighbors. The policy was successful with Swaziland (February 1982) and Mozambique (March 1984). However, it failed vis-à-vis Botswana (see Case #355).  Lesotho, too, resisted South Africa's pressure (see Case #339). In early 1985 relations improved when the totally encircled kingdom imposed stricter security controls along the border. However, in October 1985 Lesotho unexpectedly requested the UN to take "urgent, necessary and appropriate measures to deter and disarm the oppressive regime" in South Africa. Two raids on its capital, Maseru, on 20 December 1985, killing nine people, triggered a crisis for Lesotho. South Africa, the alleged culprit, denied its involvement but reaffirmed its concern over the continued presence of hostile, pro-ANC groups in its neighbor states.  On 30 December the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning South Africa's unprovoked violent acts against Lesotho and demanded compensation to the victim state. On 1 January 1986 Pretoria imposed a de facto blockade of Lesotho, justifying it as necessary to prevent "terrorist [ANC] infiltration" into South Africa. In fact, the blockade was designed to achieve several goals: to persuade Lesotho to sign a nonaggression agreement; to expel ANC activists; and to stop the activities of Soviet-bloc advisors in Lesotho.  Lesotho responded on 14 January with an appeal to the UN, the U.K., and the U.S. to mount an airlift of food and essential supplies to the besieged kingdom. If necessary, it warned, it would turn to the Soviet bloc for assistance.  As a consequence of the blockade the Prime Minister, Chief Jonathan, was deposed on 20 January: the king was given power to rule by decree, advised by the military.  South Africa welcomed the internal change in Lesotho, as evident in the easing of the blockade on 20 January. The two states signed a mutual security agreement on the 21st. And border restrictions were completely lifted on the 25th, marking the end of Lesotho's--and the international--crisis.  The U.S. and the USSR were marginally involved.
Iraq, Iran, and, briefly, Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia were the actors in this intra-war crisis from 9 February until early April 1986. The Iran/Iraq War, which erupted in mid-September 1980 (see Case #317), showed no signs of winding down after more than four years of costly campaigns--heavy casualties on both sides--and periods of stalemate (see Cases #335 and #348).  There were no less than nine land attacks by Iran and three Iraqi counterattacks in 1985. Notable was an Iranian attack in March in the area of the al-Huwayza marshes of southern Iraq that, for a time, closed the main road between Basra and Baghdad. An Iraqi counteroffensive repelled the Iranian penetration, with heavy casualties on both sides. During March there was also an exchange of air and missile raids on Teheran and Baghdad and other major cities, the first in four years. A visit by the UN Secretary-General to both states in April, in quest of a basis for peace talks, came to naught. After a long lull in the war of attrition against each other's oil installations, Iraq launched a series of air attacks against Kharg Island in August and September 1985, which succeeded, temporarily, in disrupting Iranian oil exports. In an attempt to diversify its facilities, Iran developed a floating terminal at Sirri Island. Both parties also continued to attack merchant ships in the Gulf, the "tanker war": from March to September more than 130 ships had been hit. All this was a prelude to a fresh intra-war crisis. A crisis for Iraq was triggered on 9 February 1986, when Iranian forces began a series of offensives in the south. Those aimed at Qurna and Majnoon failed to achieve their objective. However, on 10-11 February Iranian troops took Umm al-Rassas, lost it the next day, but advanced on the al-Faw Peninsula near Siba, and very near to Kuwait's island of Bubiyan, which was long coveted by Iraq (see Case #252--Iraq Invasion of Kuwait, in 1973, in Iraq/Kuwait PC). Iranian forces also began operations along the al-Faw-Basra road in order to divert Iraqi forces. Iran now threatened Iraq's only access to the Gulf and, potentially, its Umm Qasr naval base.  It was Iran's dramatic advance, notably the capture of al-Faw, and the fear of Iraq's defeat that triggered a brief crisis (11-13 February) for Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia, key financial backers for Iraq's enormously expensive war effort. Their response was to take the lead in an Arab démarche to the UN: on 13 February the foreign ministers of Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, North Yemen, Sa'udi Arabia, and Tunisia requested a meeting of the UN Security Council and a condemnation of Iran's "aggression."  The UN Secretary-General was also active at this time,to try to avoid a spillover of the Iran/Iraq War to Kuwait. Iran was cooperative: on 13 February President Khamenei assured Kuwait that Iran would respect its neutrality, provided it did not allow Iraq to use its territory for military operations against Iran. This eased the tension and ended the crisis for Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia. At the end of February the Security Council again called for a cease-fire, which was not heeded.  By mid-February Iran controlled the strategically and symbolically important port and town of al-Faw but at an estimated cost of 8,000-10,000 casualties in five days of intense fighting; Iraq's losses were 3,000-5,000. On 14 February 1986 Iraq launched a counteroffensive aimed at regaining control of al-Faw. This catalyzed an intra-war crisis for Iran. Iraq also announced the expansion of its naval exclusion zone to include the coast of Kuwait. By 20 March another stalemate set in, with Iran still in control of al-Faw. Iran's casualties for the entire campaign were 27,000-30,000, Iraq's losses, 5,000-8,000. Iran also created a second front in Iraqi Kurdistan: its Wal Fajr IX offensive drove Iraqis and Kurds from 40 villages near Suleimaniya.  The al-Faw crisis faded in early April. Iran retained control of the town of al-Faw, including 200 square kilometers of the Faw Peninsula. But Iraq was able to prevent further Iranian advances in the south. So the situation remained until the last major battle of the Iran/Iraq War in the spring of 1988 (see Case #385).
Chad, France, and Libya were enmeshed in another crisis from 10 February to the end of March 1986. Libyan forces continued to occupy the Aozou Strip after the termination of Chad/Libya VI. And the Libyan-backed GUNT remained in control of more than a third of Chad's territory--north of the 16th Parallel. There were frequent reports of Libyan reinforcements in Chad during 1985. In December President Habré of Chad indicated that he expected a fresh Libyan offensive. As often in the past, Mitterand warned Qaddhafi against an invasion. On 10 February 1986 the Libya-backed rebels, the GUNT, renewed their attacks on government forces at Oum Chalouba and captured Koro Toro near the 16th Parallel, triggering a crisis for Chad. France, too, perceived a crisis because the 16th Parallel was its "red line" against Libya's proxy, the GUNT, and Libyan forces in Chad. The same day Libyan forces reportedly attacked Chadian troops 480 kilometers northeast of the Chadian capital.  On 13 February France's defense minister arrived in N'Djamena for talks with President Habré, who had appealed for direct French military intervention. The next day French forces in the neighboring Central African Republic were put on alert, and French commandos and fighter planes were dispatched to N'Djamena.  Once more Mitterand warned Qaddhafi not to intervene in Chadian internal affairs. And on the 16th French aircraft bombed a rebel airstrip at Qadi-Doum.  Libya denied that its troops took part in the fighting. But on the 17th it responded to the French attack by sending two aircraft to bomb the airport of N'Djamena. However, it also indicated its approval of negotiations with Chad.  Fighting continued until the end of March, when the crisis faded; but the Chad/Libya conflict remained unresolved.  There were many attempts at mediation between President Habré of Chad and GUNT leader Goukouni Oueddei: by the OAU's chairman, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal; and by the presidents of Congo, Nigeria, Togo, and Zaire. However, Goukouni demanded an OAU condemnation of "French aggression" prior to any direct negotiations with the government. On 29 March Diouf declared that "Habré is the one who wants peace, unity and territorial integrity."  The U.S. State Department announced on 13 March that it would provide Chad with emergency military aid of $10 million. The UN and the USSR were marginally involved.
Libya and the United States were embroiled in a second crisis over the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra) from 24 March until 21 April 1986. Like the Mediterranean Sea, into which it flowed, the Gulf of Syrte was traditionally viewed as international waters. Since October 1973, however, Qaddhafi's Libya had claimed the entire Gulf as its territorial waters. This was first challenged in 1981 soon after Reagan entered the White House: U.S. naval exercises in the Gulf sparked a confrontation and crisis with Libya (see Case #330).  This process was replicated in the second crisis. In January 1986 Washington announced its intent to hold two naval exercises in the Gulf, on 23-30 January and 11-14 February. U.S. naval aircraft intercepted Libyan planes during those maneuvers; but there was no violence. On 20 March the Pentagon announced that several ships of the U.S.'s Sixth Fleet would cross into the Gulf south of latitude 32' 30". On the 23rd U.S. naval aircraft flew south of that designated line; but that act was almost routine by then. A full-scale foreign policy crisis for Libya was triggered by the implementation of the 20 March announcement, that is, the entry into the Gulf of Syrte of three U.S. naval vessels on 24 March. Libya, perceiving this act as a grave threat to its territorial integrity, fired two Soviet-made SAM-5 missiles on U.S. carrier-based planes, causing no damage. U.S. planes then attacked a Libyan missile ship and a corvette, as well as mounting raids on the radar installations of Libyan batteries at Syrte. Another clash occurred on the 25th, with conflicting and disputed claims of casualties from another U.S. air attack. President Qaddhafi's initial verbal reaction, the same day, took the form of tit-for-tat: "this is not a time for speaking … it is a time for war."  U.S. naval maneuvers ended on 27 March, four days ahead of schedule. On the 28th Secretary of State Shultz warned that U.S. forces would take further action against Libya if necessary. Tension increased on 2 April when a bomb exploded on a TWA plane flying from Rome to Athens: four passengers were killed. The U.S. accused Libya of being involved; Libya denied any responsibility; and Shultz later acknowledged this.  While the U.S. was deeply involved from the outset, triggering Libya's crisis, it experienced all three conditions of a foreign policy crisis only on 5 April, when a bomb exploded in a discotheque frequented by U.S. soldiers in West Berlin: one U.S. soldier and a Turkish woman were killed, with 155 persons injured. On the 7th the U.S. Ambassador to West Germany, Richard Burt, linked this terrorist act to Libya. On the 9th Libya denied any involvement. The same day, Reagan referred to Qaddhafi as a "mad dog" and warned of U.S. retaliation.  On the 9th, too, the U.S. president approved a proposal for air strikes against Libya; among his security advisors, only Defense Secretary Weinberger dissented. The major response to the crisis was implemented on 15 April, in the form of air raids on Tripoli and Benghazi: the attack was described by Reagan as "a single engagement in a long battle against terrorism." The U.S. neither affirmed nor denied that the primary goal of the raids was to kill Qaddhafi; but one of his children was among the reported 100 civilian casualties in Tripoli (and 30 in Benghazi).  The successful air strikes on Libya's two largest cities drastically reduced stress for the U.S., terminating its crisis. But it was not until a draft resolution sympathetic to Libya was debated in the UN Security Council on 21 April that Libya's crisis--and the second international crisis over the Gulf of Syrte--came to an end: although the resolution was vetoed by the U.S. and the U.K., its condemnation of U.S. actions ensured that another U.S. air raid on Libya would not occur, at least in the near future.  Many international organizations and states were involved in this interstate crisis. The UN Security Council debated the issue from 26 to 31 March and, as noted, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution critical of U.S. air raids on Libya: despite the U.S.-U.K. veto, it effectively terminated the crisis. The USSR and several Arab states--Algeria, Morocco, and Sa'udi Arabia, along with the PLO and Iran--criticized the U.S. naval exercises and strongly condemned the U.S. air raids. So too did the Arab League; but it rejected Libya's demand that member-states sever diplomatic and economic relations with Washington.  Europe, too, was involved. Foreign ministers of the European Community met on 14 April: they urged restraint by both adversaries, criticized Libya as the source of terrorism, but did not accede to the U.S. request to impose economic sanctions on Libya. Earlier, France and West Germany expelled some Libyan diplomats.  (During the next decade Libya was treated as a pariah state by the U.S.--and the UN--over its refusal to hand over two Libyans suspected of causing the bombing of a Pan American flight over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988, with hundreds of casualties, mostly U.S. citizens. UN sanctions were imposed; but there was no further full-scale crisis between Libya and the U.S.)
Bahrain experienced a crisis with Qatar over disputed territory from 26 April until 15 June 1986. These two Persian Gulf ministates had been protectorates of the U.K., Bahrain from 1861, Qatar from 1916. Both were granted independence in 1971 as part of the last phase of Britain's retreat from empire in the Middle East.  Bahrain and Qatar had a long-standing dispute over the Hawar Islands adjacent to the Qatar Peninsula. There were periodic outbreaks of tension since the 1930s, but not a full-scale interstate crisis. In 1985 Bahrain began to construct a coast guard station on al-Dibal Island, within the disputed area. A crisis for Bahrain was triggered on 26 April 1986, when Qatari soldiers landed on al-Dibal, declared the island a "restricted zone," and arrested Bahraini officials. The raising of Qatar's flag on the 28th accentuated the perception of a threat to Bahrain's territorial integrity. On the 30th Bahrain denounced the occupation as "a violation of good-neighborliness."  The Netherlands, too, protested to Qatar because Qatari soldiers had seized a group of foreign workers employed by a Dutch construction company, Ballast Nedam Groep. Mediation by Oman, Sa'udi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Bahrain and Qatar, and Kuwait, led to an agreement: Qatari troops would withdraw from al-Dibal; and the tiny island would be evacuated by the Dutch construction company. All foreign workers were released on 12 May. And Qatari troops withdrew on 15 June, terminating the crisis.  There was no violence. The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the Arab League were not involved in this minicrisis between ministates.
Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe experienced a crisis with the Union of South Africa in May 1986. and Pre-Crisis The African National Congress (ANC), the largest organization of black South Africans opposed to the white regime in Pretoria, was founded in 1912. For almost half a century it pursued non-violence as the path to racial equality. In 1960 it adopted a strategy of military struggle against the apartheid system and was outlawed. Its campaign of guerrilla attacks from neighboring states, notably Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, reached a peak in 1985-86. On 15 May 1986 President Botha warned these three "front-line states," all of which were vulnerable to South Africa's military and economic power, of the risk of providing a sanctuary for ANC fighters. The crisis trigger for these three states was "punitive" air and commando raids by the South African Defence Forces on 19 May against selective ANC targets in Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The U.S. condemned the attack the same day but persisted with its policy of "constructive engagement" and opposition to economic sanctions against South Africa.  On 20 May the six front-line states of southern Africa opposed to the apartheid regime--Angola, Mozambique, and Tanzania, along with the three targets of South Africa's cross-border raid--condemned the Pretoria regime and called upon the international community to impose mandatory, comprehensive, economic sanctions in order to bring about "peace and stability in the region." The OAU called for world pressure to prevent further Union of South Africa raids against its neighbors. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, too, urged sanctions. By contrast, South Africa's President Botha, clearly seeking U.S. understanding and support, compared the cross-border raid to the U.S. air raid on Libya two months earlier (see Case #363).  At the UN, the Secretary-General condemned the raids as violations of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the three target states and of the UN Charter. A Security Council draft resolution calling for mandatory economic sanctions, sponsored by Senegal on behalf of the OAU and by Zambia speaking for the front-line states, received a large majority but was vetoed by the U.K. and the U.S. on 23 May. After the Security Council's vote the crisis faded in late May. The USSR was marginally involved in this crisis.
Uganda experienced a crisis with Sudan from 19 August 1986 to early June 1987. Sudan has been beset with internal turmoil since its independence in 1956. During the early years (September 1963-March 1972) civil strife took the form of the "Anya-Nya" war against non-Muslim rebels in the south, who relied upon bases in neighboring states, notably Uganda. There were frequent cross-border raids by Sudanese forces, meetings between leaders of Sudan and Uganda, some agreements to cooperate against the rebels, persistent high tension. The costly Anya-Nya war between Sudan and the Southern Sudanese Liberation Movement--there were several hundred thousand, mostly civilian, casualties--ended on 12 March 1972, with Ethiopian mediation. However, domestic strife and low-intensity conflict between Sudan and Uganda--and within both states--persisted through the 1970s and into the 1980s.  A brief respite in a parallel internal war in Uganda began on 17 December 1985, when Yoweri Museveni, leader of the National Resistance Army (NRA), and General Tito Okello, head of Uganda's Military Council, signed a "peace agreement" in Nairobi ending the former's attempts to overthrow Uganda's regime. Kenya and Tanzania, the mediators, undertook to create a peacekeeping force to monitor the cease-fire. It was short-lived. The NRA resumed its military campaign on 17 January 1986 and took control of Kampala on the 26th. Museveni became President three days later. However, civil strife between the NRA, now in power, and rebel troops of the former Military Council, led by General Okello, continued during the next six months. Uganda's internal conflict acquired an interstate dimension on 19 August, when some 400 rebel troops crossed the border from Sudan and attacked the strategically important town of Gulu in Uganda. Museveni accused Sudan of supporting the rebels. Khartoum denied any involvement but acknowledged that it was difficult to control the border with Uganda because of widespread instability in southern Sudan, alluding to the long-standing civil war against the renamed Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Uganda, in turn, denied that it was supporting the SPLA. In September the Kampala regime unilaterally closed the border with Sudan temporarily.  Civil strife in Uganda continued until an amnesty for all rebel forces went into effect on 11 June 1987. Several days earlier, President Museveni and Sudan's Prime Minister, Sadiq el-Mahdi, met in Khartoum. They agreed on measures to enhance border security, trade relations, and extradition, thereby ending their crisis.  There was no involvement by either of the superpowers, the UN or the OAU.
Malawi experienced a crisis with Mozambique from 11 September to 18 December 1986. Mozambique's relations with its neighbors had deteriorated since the early 1980s. On the one hand, South Africa accused it of providing a sanctuary for the African National Congress and allowing ANC fighters to launch raids into South Africa from its territory (see Case #323). Moreover, Mozambique accused Malawi of supporting the Resistencia Nacional Mocambicana, the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR): this charge was publicly made by the Chief of Staff of Mozambique's armed forces, Colonel-General Sebastiao Mabote, in July 1986. On 11 September 1986, at a minisummit of black African leaders in the Malawi town of Blantyre, President Machel of Mozambique threatened to deploy missiles along the border with Malawi and to close the border. This triggered a crisis for Malawi. President Banda of Malawi denied any kind of involvement in MNR activities. President Kaunda of Zambia also threatened to close its borders with both Mozambique and Malawi unless the latter changed its policy.  Banda responded on the 17th by announcing that he would no longer permit the MNR to maintain bases in Malawi and by proposing a joint security commission with Mozambique. And in early October he issued an expulsion order against MNR fighters in Malawi. Bilateral relations improved thereafter, despite an accusation by Foreign Minister Botha of South Africa on 6 November that Zimbabwe and Mozambique were involved in a plot to overthrow the regime of President Banda. There were some minor clashes--but not as a technique of crisis management; rather, both parties relied on negotiation. The crisis ended amicably on 18 December with an accord on mutual cooperation and a protocol covering defense, state security, and public order.  There was no involvement in this crisis by the UN, the OAU, the U.S., or the USSR.
Togo experienced a crisis with Ghana from 23 September 1986 to 5 February 1987. As part of the "scramble for Africa" among Europe's great powers, Togoland became a German protectorate in 1884. During World War I an Anglo-French agreement (1916) over the "spoils of war" divided Togoland, with the French part, Togo, attached to French West Africa. It became a UN Trust Territory in 1946, with France as the Trusteeship power. After a UN plebiscite it became an autonomous republic in 1956. Along with the rest of France's empire in Africa, Togo became independent, on 27 April 1960. Its first head of state, Sylvanus Olympio, was overthrown by an army coup in 1963. Nicholas Grunitzky, who succeeded him, was ousted in 1967 by another army coup led by the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Etienne Eyadema, who remained in power for more than two decades. Since 1963 French military intervention was permitted under the terms of a France-Togo defense agreement. A crisis for Togo was triggered by another attempted military coup, on 23 September 1986. The rebels' objective was to seize the radio station and the military barracks which also served as the president's residence and the headquarters of the governing party, the RPT (Rassemblement du Peuple Togolais). Togo accused Ghana of supporting the coup. Fourteen persons were killed in clashes with security forces in the capital, Lomé. Many of the 60 rebels were captured during that sole outbreak of violence.  Togo managed its crisis with Ghana by non-violent means. On the 24th a curfew was imposed, the Lomé international airport was closed, and Togo's borders with Ghana and Benin were closed. The next day Eyadema requested French military assistance in accordance with the 1963 defense agreement. France responded on the 26th, dispatching 150 paratroops and jet aircraft. The same day Zaire, too, sent troops to support Eyadema. On the 28th President Mobutu of Zaire visited Togo, as did representatives from Ivory Coast, Benin, Niger, Morocco, and Liberia in a show of support. On the 29th Togo again accused Ghana--and Burkina Faso--of training the rebels; both denied any involvement. In October and November about 300 Ghanaians were charged with illegal entry into Togo and were deported.  During an OAU fact-finding mission Secretary-General Oumarou discussed the crisis with leaders of both countries. The mission reported on 26 November without supporting or rejecting Togo's charges. By then the crisis was winding down, though it lingered for another two months. Burkina Faso sent a delegation to Lomé on 13 January 1987 for the celebration of Eyadema's 20 years in power. Togo reopened its border with Ghana on 2 February. And on the 5th Togo, in an official announcement, absolved Ghana of any involvement in the attempted coup. This ended the crisis.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  (In March, Togo's foreign minister called for a restoration of normal relations.)
Honduras and Nicaragua were embroiled in the second of several interstate crises linked to the contras and their anti-Sandinista rebellion from 4 to 12 December 1986. In August 1986 the military regime in Honduras reaffirmed its formal strictures on the training of contras by foreign (U.S.) forces on its territory. However, American pressure during talks in October led to the creation of a U.S.-Honduras joint military commission to coordinate training of the contras and to the first large shipment of U.S. arms in early November.  During October and November fighting between the contras and Sandinista forces escalated near the Honduran border village of Arenales. On 1 November Nicaraguan troops pursued contra rebels, penetrating five kilometers into Honduras. Further incursions into the El Paraiso Department of Honduras were reported in late November. The civil war was about to spill over into an interstate crisis. A crisis for Honduras was triggered by a major Sandinista cross-border military operation against contra bases on 4 December: a Honduran border post at Las Mieles was overrun, three Honduran soldiers were wounded, and two were captured. A Honduran protest was rejected by Nicaragua, which denied its incursion, even though its troops were operating at least five kilometers across the border near the town of Teotecacinte.  Honduras launched a combined political-military response. On 6 December President Azcona del Hoyo requested U.S. military assistance, which was granted by President Reagan immediately. The same day Honduran planes bombed Sandinista troops in the border area, triggering a crisis for Nicaragua, which reported seven soldiers and two civilians killed.  U.S. military involvement in this crisis became more visible on 7-8 December, when American helicopters transported more than 1,000 Honduran soldiers to the border area, 40 kilometers from the fighting. Nicaragua responded on the 9th by appealing to the UN Security Council. At the Council's meeting on the 10th Nicaragua's representative blamed Honduras for rejecting its proposal to dispatch a UN commission of inquiry; and it claimed that Honduras's army launched attacks against Nicaragua "on orders from Washington." The U.S. delegate denied the charge. Honduras made the countercharge of repeated Nicaraguan incursions into its territory.  The fighting ended within several days. There was no formal agreement or tacit understanding between the adversaries. Rather, crisis termination was evident in a confirmation by Honduras on 12 December that it had requested the U.S. to remove contra rebels from its territory.  Although the USSR was a patron of the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua from its inception, Moscow remained aloof from this crisis.
Chad and Libya were embroiled in another crisis from 12 December 1986 to 11 September 1987. In the months following the violence of February-March 1986 (see Case #362--Chad/Libya VII), Libyan forces remained in northern Chad, supporting the GUNT, as in the past. In June Chad complained to the UN Security Council against Libya's continuing occupation of its northern territory.  A crucial change in the balance of internal Chadian forces occurred in August, a split in the GUNT. This was followed in October by a new round of fighting--between the forces of former GUNT leader Goukhouni and the Libyans. Chad claimed on 10 November that Libyan armed forces had killed hundreds of people in air and ground attacks in the north. On the 15th President Habré of Chad stated that government forces (the FANT) were cooperating with Goukouni's forces, now known as the Popular Armed Forces--FAP. On 11 December 1986 Libyan troops launched an attack on Goukouni's FAP forces in northern Chad and, according to the Chad government, used napalm and poison gas. This triggered a crisis for Chad. The same day a Libyan fighter plane was shot down over northern Chad.  Habré appealed for French, U.S., and Soviet armed intervention. On the 17th French aircraft dropped food, medical supplies, and ammunition to the FAP forces. However, the French defense ministry declared the same day that no French soldiers or aircraft would intervene to liberate northern Chad from Libyan occupation: the 1,000 French troops and aircraft in N'Djamena would be used only to defend the capital. On the 18th the U.S. State Department said it was rushing emergency military aid to the Chadian government.  Libya responded by appealing to the Arab League and the OAU for help against "a dangerous threat as a result of the U.S.-French military intervention" in the crisis. Chad, by contrast, complained that the OAU did not condemn Libya, despite its "inhuman acts." The USSR demanded that all "imperialist interference" in Chad cease.  In late December Chad government troops, now allied with Goukouni's former rebels, succeeded in crossing the 16th Parallel, the informal boundary between Libyan and French spheres of influence in Chad since 1984. Moreover, on 2 January 1987 Chad pressed its attack; and, after heavy fighting it claimed the recapture of the northeast oasis of Fada and the northwest oasis of Zouar. This triggered a crisis for Libya. On the 4th Libyan aircraft bombed civilians in Arada, south of the 16th Parallel. The same day Libya called up all army reservists.  In accord with France's defensive strategy, French forces in Chad established an air defense system to prevent any further Libyan military action south of the 16th Parallel; and French aircraft bombed Libyan radar at the airstrip at Qadi-Doum. France also continued to send military aid to the Chadian government army.  Fighting continued in the north, especially around the area of Zouar, a crucial point in Libya's plan to form a ring around the northern Tibesti region.  In this phase of the fighting, Algeria, Nigeria, and Zaire offered to mediate; and Niger called for an emergency OAU meeting to consider the crisis. The OAU Secretary-General visited the Chadian and Libyan capitals. Egypt condemned Libya's military intervention in Chad's internal affairs.  Despite the flurry of African mediation diplomacy, both sides continued their military buildup in the north. Low-intensity clashes continued intermittently during the next six months.  In a brief breakthrough, Chad government troops captured the town of Aozou in the disputed Strip on 8 August. On the 29th Libya launched a counterattack and took back control over Aozou. Libya also continued to bomb Chad, including towns south of the 16th Parallel.  Following the Chadian attack on 8 August, Libya complained to the UN Security Council that Chad had attacked its territory.  Despite repeated requests from Habré, France refused to provide air cover for its exposed towns, other than the capital.  As the fighting escalated, Chadian government forces invaded Libya on 5 September 1987--for the first time--and occupied the important air base of Maaten-es-Sara: it claimed the destruction of 30 combat aircraft and the base itself. France expressed concern at Chad's actions, while the U.S. welcomed the Chadian raid.  Following successful and well-received mediation efforts by the OAU Chairman, President Kaunda of Zambia, de-escalation was swift. The crisis came to an end on 11 September, when both sides accepted an OAU call for a cease-fire. They also agreed to a meeting of an ad hoc OAU committee in Lusaka on 23 September.  (The long-standing territorial dispute between Chad and Libya--Libya first occupied the Aozou Strip in 1973--was submitted by them to the International Court of Justice [ICJ] in 1990 for a binding ruling. In a turning-point decision on 3 February 1994 the ICJ ruled, by a vote of 16-1, in favor of Chad's claim to the Strip. The Court decided that the international border between Chad and Libya had been formally fixed by a treaty between France, then the colonial power in Chad, and Libya in 1955, which clearly assigned the Aozou Strip to Chad. Libya had also claimed 310,000 square miles of northern Chad and had long occupied it under the terms of a de facto agreement with France that divided Chad at the 16th Parallel into spheres of influence [see Case #290--Chad/Libya III].  Negotiations between Chad and Libya to implement the Court's ruling led to an agreement on the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Aozou Strip, to begin on 15 April and to be completed on 10 May, and to be monitored by international observers. The Strip was formally transferred by Libya to Chad on 30 May 1994.)
Vietnam and China were embroiled in another border crisis from 5 to 10 January 1987. The two long-standing adversaries accused each other of initiating the crisis on 5 January 1987 by an attack across their border--in the Vi Xuyen District of Ha Tuyen Province of Vietnam, claimed Hanoi; in Yunnan Province of China, asserted Beijing. For both it was a threat to territorial integrity.  Whichever state set the crisis in motion, the response was identical--a large-scale counterattack across the border. Vietnam claimed that 1,500 Chinese were killed in battles that raged for three days and that the Chinese had penetrated 18 kilometers into Vietnam territory. By the 8th, according to Hanoi, the Chinese advance had been halted, with Chinese forces being compelled to retreat across the border. This marked the end of Vietnam's crisis. China acknowledged that, on 7 January, its "frontier guards" made "counterattacks" against Vietnamese troops--as a response to a Vietnamese attack in the Laoshan area of Yunnan Province. The crisis ended for China on 10 January when it claimed that 500 Vietnamese troops were killed or wounded. China also denied Vietnamese reports that 1,500 Chinese soldiers were killed, although it admitted that there were "considerable losses," due to the inexperience of its soldiers.  While both parties claimed victory, the crisis ended in a stalemate: neither had achieved its main objective--defeating and, if possible, humiliating its long-standing rival for influence in Southeast Asia; neither emerged with enhanced power and influence; and both suffered considerable casualties. In all of these respects, the outcome seemed to replicate their full-scale war from mid-December 1978 to March 1979 (see Case #298).  Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN or any regional organization, was involved in this crisis.  (On 13 January China rejected a Vietnamese proposal for talks on the border confrontation and linked the resolution of their conflict with the withdrawal of Vietnam from Cambodia--which Vietnam had occupied since the beginning of 1979 [see Case #284--Vietnam Invasion of Cambodia, in Indochina PC].  Although this crisis ended quickly, further border incidents between China and Vietnam occurred during the months of February and March. More important, it was followed a year later by a major Sino/Vietnam crisis over potentially valuable territory and a continuing source of tension [see Case #384--Spratly Islands]. And their protracted conflict remains unresolved.)
India and Pakistan were embroiled in one of the many crises during their protracted conflict from mid-January to 19 February 1987. Despite periodic attempts to improve relations between India and Pakistan, the dominant traits for almost half a century have been mutual mistrust, hostility, tension, and frequent eruptions of violence. So it was in 1986, when relations worsened because of renewed fighting in Kashmir, a prize territory in dispute since independence (see Cases #119--Kashmir I, in 1947-49; #216--Kashmir II, in 1965-66; and #392--Kashmir III, in 1990), and because of India's allegation of Pakistan's material assistance to Sikh guerrilla activities aimed at independence in the Indian state of Punjab.  The concerns of both parties began to escalate when the adversary's forces did not return to their bases after substantial military exercises in October-December 1986 along the Indo/Pakistani border. At the beginning of December India and Pakistan increased the number of soldiers concentrated near their border, each side claiming it was part of routine military exercises in the area. In mid-January 1987 Indian reports claimed that Pakistani troops had crossed the Sutlej, one of the five major rivers in the Indus river system, and had massed troops and equipment in Pakistani (West) Punjab. The Pakistani buildup triggered a crisis for India in mid-January.  Tension intensified with reports of a large-scale Indian military exercise code-named "Brass Tacks" in the Rajasthan Desert contiguous to Pakistan. On 20 January Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi expressed India's "tremendous concern" over the continuing massing of Pakistani troops along the border; but he added that India was always willing to discuss the situation with Pakistan to solve their problems.  India's major response to the crisis, on 23 January, was to place its army and air force on red alert and to move troops closer to the border. An Indian defence ministry spokesman said "India will not be taken by surprise"; and the Indian navy was asked to "keep its eyes open." India's crisis management also took the form of diplomacy: Pakistan's high commissioner to New Delhi was summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs the same day and was asked to convey to Islamabad India's concern over the continuing deployment of Pakistani troops on the border. At the same time India's view of Pakistan's warlike activities was also communicated to the U.S. and Soviet ambassadors and to the members of the UN Security Council, with an expression of India's sincere desire to de-escalate the tension.  India's assertive military and diplomatic response triggered a crisis for Pakistan. Whatever the intention of its military buildup, Pakistan adopted a conciliatory line at once. India's high commissioner (ambassador) to Islamabad was informed on the 23rd of Pakistan's willingness to begin a dialogue in order to wind down the border tension. And the next day Pakistan's high commissioner to Delhi said his country had no aggressive intentions. He described the deployment of Pakistani troops as part of normal military exercises; and he repeated Pakistan's willingness for immediate talks to defuse the tension. This was reciprocated by an Indian defence ministry spokesman, who declared that India's escalatory military moves were only a reaction to the provocative movements of Pakistani forces.  In the frame of diplomatic efforts at accommodation, talks began on 31 January in New Delhi at the level of senior civil servants--the foreign secretary of each state. After five days of negotiations India and Pakistan signed an agreement on 4 February. It provided for a gradual troop withdrawal, sector-by-sector, to end the military confrontation within 15 days. The two countries agreed "not to attack each other" and to avoid provocative actions along the border. India reportedly agreed that its large-scale military exercise in Rajasthan, Brass Tacks, would remain several kilometers from the border with Pakistan. It was also agreed that further talks would be held in Islamabad later.  On 19 February India and Pakistan completed the withdrawal of their troops from the Ravi-Chenab corridor in the Jammu sector along the border. That terminated the crisis for both sides. (The Brass Tacks exercise ended on 25 March.)  Unlike in earlier South Asian crises, neither of the superpowers, nor the U.K., or the UN, was involved in this India/Pakistan crisis: the global organization was highly involved in 1947-49 (see Case #119--Kashmir I), among others; the U.K. was active in 1965 (see Case #214--Rann of Kutch); the USSR was an active mediator in 1965-66 (see Case #216--Kashmir II); and the U.S. was active in 1971 (see Case #242--Bangladesh), among others.  The only, low-key, third party involvement was that of Egypt. On 28 January 1987 President Mubarak phoned Prime Minister Gandhi from Kuwait, where he and Pakistan's President, Zia-ul-Haq, were attending a meeting of the Islamic Conference Organization. Gandhi asked Mubarak to convey a message to Zia, namely, that he was totally opposed to the military buildup, and to inform all heads of state at the conference that India had no hostile intentions against Pakistan.
Somalia experienced another crisis with Ethiopia from 12 February until early April 1987. Low-intensity violence between these long-standing adversaries continued unabated through the 1980s, for the most part indirectly: the protagonists acted through ethnic, paramilitary, proxy organizations--the Ethiopian-backed Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) and the Somali National Movement (SNM), against the Somalia-supported Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF). Somalia persistently claimed jurisdiction over Somalis living in the Ogaden Desert. Ethiopia persistently rejected the Somali claim. Occasionally border incidents escalated to an interstate crisis. One of these occurred in 1987. A crisis for Somalia was triggered on 12 February 1987 when Ethiopia-backed SNM irregulars penetrated 20 kilometers beyond the border and attacked six Somali villages in Todghere Province. Somalia repulsed the attack, reportedly within hours, each side suffering about 25 casualties in the incident. On 17 February Ethiopia indirectly acknowledged responsibility by announcing that an official inquiry would be held to determine the cause of the incident. Addis Ababa also reaffirmed its interest in achieving a peace accord with its neighbor. Lesser incidents occurred during the next six weeks. An interim cease-fire agreement was reached in Mogadishu in early April, terminating the crisis.  (A year later, on 3 April 1988, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to demilitarize their border and to restore diplomatic relations.)  The U.S., the USSR, the UN, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
Syria experienced a crisis from 15 February to 6 April 1987 as a result of a sharp escalation in fighting among the contending factions in Lebanon. After three decades of coexistence between Lebanese Christians and Muslims, framed by the "National Pact" of 1943, civil war erupted in April 1975. It was compounded by the presence of a large visible Palestinian refugee community in southern Lebanon, under the leadership of the PLO.  There were several international crises in Lebanon during the next decade (see Cases #265--Lebanon Civil War I, in 1976; #289--Litani Operation, arising from Israel's first major incursion into Lebanon, in 1978, in Arab/Israel PC; #337--War in Lebanon, triggered by Israel's large-scale invasion, in 1982-83, in Arab/Israel PC). Earlier, the Arab League had legitimized Syria's primacy in Lebanon by creating an Arab Deterrent Force (ADF), composed almost entirely of Syrian troops. Internal strife--among the paramilitary forces of Amal, the largest Shia militia in Lebanon, Hizbullah, the "Party of God," a pro-Iranian, extremist Shia militia in south Lebanon, the Druze forces in the Shouf mountains near Beirut, and PLO forces, mostly in the south--was endemic: from mid-October 1986 to January 1987 it became more visible, including the kidnapping of Western journalists and clergymen. Fighting between Amal and other competing groups in Lebanon escalated sharply on 15 February 1987: Amal militiamen laid siege to Palestinian refugee camps, blocking convoys of food and medical supplies. The renewed instability triggered a crisis for Syria, threatening its self-asserted hegemony over its western neighbor.  On the 19th Shia leaders, fearing an Amal defeat, requested Syrian intervention to take control of security in west Beirut--east Beirut was controlled by Christian militias, notably the Lebanese Forces. Factional fighting intensified on the 20th, with 200 killed. Internal instability was compounded by Hizbullah's escalation of cross-border raids into, and shelling of, northern Israeli border settlements. In fact, Syria perceived Iran, Hizbullah's mentor and arms supplier, as the source of threat to its primacy in Lebanon.  On 22 February Syria responded to a perceived threat to its influence in Lebanon by dispatching ADF (really Syrian) forces to take control over west Beirut. Only the PLO denounced this intervention. Even Israel, through Defense Minister Rabin, declared that Israel would not oppose the ADF (Syrian) deployment provided it was limited to Beirut. Within a day Syrian forces controlled all of west Beirut. However, on the 24th, they killed 26 Lebanese in the Bourj Hammoud district of the capital, including 18 members of Hizbullah and 3 from Amal. This led to a demonstration of 10,000 supporters of Hizbullah: the incident occurred while Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, and its Revolutionary Guards Minister, Muhsin Rafiqdost, were meeting with President Asad in Damascus. On the 25th the head of Syria's forces in Beirut, Brigadier-General Ghazi Kan'an, announced that they would not be deployed in the south Beirut Shia suburbs. And on 4 March Amal, under Syria's pressure, freed 600 PLO prisoners.  Syria and Iran shared a common interest--hostility to Iraq. However, the former's secularism clashed with the latter's Islamic fundamentalism: Iran objected to antifundamentalist measures adopted by Syria, whose troops pressed Lebanese men to shave their beards and women not to wear the chador (veil): President Khamenei indicated Iran's displeasure with these acts and criticized Syrian soldiers on 6 March. Iran's interior minister conveyed this message to Asad the same day.  Syria's behavior was motivated by the determination to brook no interference with its hegemony in Lebanon. This included the posting of a 500-strong force along the Beirut-Sidon coast road and the use of Special Forces whenever deemed necessary. Finally, on 6 April a Syrian-mediated cease-fire agreement came into effect and ended the Amal siege of the Palestinian refugee camps: trucks carrying food and medical supplies were allowed to enter the camps. Although clashes between Amal and PLO forces erupted again near Sidon on 19 July--and continued to erupt periodically over the years--this specific crisis, with Iran perceived as the source of threat, ended with the cease-fire agreement of 6 April.  There was no UN or Arab League involvement in this crisis. Both superpowers, too, remained aloof.
Morocco, along with Mauritania and Algeria, experienced a crisis from 25 February to 4 May 1987 over the "Sand Wall" Morocco constructed across Western Sahara. In February 1976, early in the protracted conflict over Western (former Spanish) Sahara, the Polisario Front proclaimed an independent Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR or SAHRAWI) (see Case #261). Despite strenuous efforts by Morocco to abort the incipient political entity, the SADR was recognized by many African states and was admitted to the OAU as a full member in 1984. This led to Morocco's withdrawal from Africa's regional organization.  As part of its defensive "wall strategy" in the ongoing war against Polisario, Morocco began in mid-February 1987 to build a new sand wall, the sixth: it was designed to go further south along the Mauritanian border in order to prevent Polisario direct access to the Atlantic Ocean, unless it passed through Mauritanian territory. Heavy fighting broke out in Western Sahara on 25 February 1987 between Morocco's armed forces and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front, in the area between Farsia and Mahbes near the Algerian border. That triggered a new crisis for Morocco in the protracted conflict over Western Sahara.  In late February and March both sides claimed victory on the battlefield. Morocco accused Polisario of launching an offensive in order to "bring down the defense wall and get a foothold inside the wall enclosure" and claimed success "along the whole defense line," including progress in the building of the sixth defensive wall in Oued Eddahab Province. Polisario reported that "hundreds of Moroccan soldiers were put out of action" and claimed failure in Morocco's defensive wall strategy.  On 4 March the SADR ambassador in Algeria announced that an assassination attempt against the President of the SADR, Mohamed Abd-ul Aziz, planned for 27 February, had failed. He accused Morocco's interior minister of being behind the plot. The official Algerian Press Service (APS) condemned Morocco for its trying to "bring about the physical elimination of SAHRAWI leaders." On the 17th Morocco denied any involvement in the assassination attempt.  In mid-April 1987 the new Moroccan sand wall impinged on Mauritania's territorial integrity since Polisario forces would be obliged to pass through Mauritania in order to reach the Atlantic Ocean: the Moroccan wall, at one point, was only 400 meters from a key Mauritanian railway line, used to transport iron ore from the mines at Zerouate to Mauritania's commercial capital, Nouadhibou.  This development catalyzed a crisis for Mauritania and, as a spillover effect, for Algeria as well. The likelihood of new clashes on its territory triggered a crisis for Mauritania in mid-April. That threat to Mauritania, in turn, increased the danger of a wider conflict involving Algeria, thus triggering a crisis at the same time for Algeria as well.  On 13 April Mauritania delivered a strong warning to Morocco over the new sand wall close to its border; specifically, that the wall obliged Mauritania to "give priority to ways of defending itself." The Mauritanian statement, however, reaffirmed its neutrality in the war over Western Sahara.  Morocco, through its commander in the southern zone, tried to reassure Mauritania by claiming that there was a no-man's-land between the borders of Morocco and Mauritania and that the latter's railway installations would not be impaired by the wall.  Algeria, too, expressed concern over the "dangerous situation" created by Morocco's new sand wall, blaming Morocco for undermining the stability of the region and for acting against the efforts to solve the conflict. Its foreign ministry issued a statement that declared total support for Mauritania's territorial integrity and for the "security of its towns and economic installations which are now directly exposed to military operations linked to the conflict imposed on the Western Saharan people." On 26 April President Chadli Ben-Jedid of Algeria visited Mauritania and promised support for Mauritania's territorial integrity.  Notwithstanding this verbal tension, the Moroccan/Algerian dimension of this episode in the protracted conflict de-escalated quickly. On 4 May King Hassan of Morocco and President Ben-Jedid of Algeria met on the Algerian-Moroccan border under the auspices of King Fahd of Sa'udi Arabia. King Hassan and President Ben-Jedid met briefly for fifteen minutes, King Fahd met at length separately with both parties, and then all three held a 75-minute meeting. The summit was held in order to defuse tension on the border and did not attempt to resolve the whole Western Sahara conflict. They agreed only to continue contacts to "solve the existing problems." Following the meeting, both Hassan and Bendjedid issued statements to pursue meetings in the future and work to resolve problems. Although their summit meeting did not generate a formal agreement or any solution to the conflict, it reduced tension between Morocco and Algeria and terminated the crisis for all three state participants.  Before the meeting Polisario expressed doubt about King Fahd's role as a mediator since it perceived Sa'udi Arabia as the major source of financial aid to Morocco; and it demanded a direct dialogue with Morocco. Algeria, as usual, backed Polisario's demand for direct negotiations between Morocco and the SADR. A U.S. State Department spokesman said on the 4th that the U.S. "applauded" the meeting, the first one between Morocco and Algeria since 1983.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
Greece and Turkey were enmeshed in another Aegean Sea crisis from 1 to 28 March 1987. In January 1987 Greek Prime Minister Papandreou reiterated that the dialogue with Turkey should be based upon the status quo and offered to accept a judgment by the International Court of Justice, based upon the principle that islands have their own continental shelf. Turkey rejected the principle. And Greece rejected binding arbitration of the dispute. The situation was ripe for another crisis. The catalyst to Greece's crisis was an announcement by an international consortium on 1 March that its North Aegean Petroleum Company (NAPC) would begin prospecting for oil at the end of the month, 16 kilometers east of the island of Thassos, outside Greek territorial waters: Greece perceived Turkey's support of the NAPC's plan and, therefore, a high value threat, time pressure, and a heightened likelihood of military hostilities with its historic rival. Athens declared that oil prospecting in international waters was the responsibility--and right--of the geographically contiguous state and hinted that it might take over control of the NAPC. This triggered a crisis for Turkey. Its deputy prime minister replied on 2 March that Turkey would do "whatever is necessary" if the NAPC began to prospect for oil in international waters.  In early March, too, the Turkish ship, Piri Reis, was sailing in the vicinity of Greek islands. Greece protested that the ship's course was provocative, while Turkey claimed that Greece was challenging a legitimate voyage. On 6 March Greece hinted again that it might take control over the NAPC, which was mining the oil field, Prinos, off the island of Thassos.  The crisis escalated sharply on 25 March, when Ankara authorized the Turkish Petroleum Corporation to search for oil in the Aegean Sea outside Turkish territorial waters, off the Greek islands of Lesbos, Lemnos, and Samothrace. The next day Greece warned that, if the Turkish "research vessel," Sizmik I, probed for oil in areas that, under international law, belonged to Greece, it would "take the necessary measures to ensure its sovereign rights." Greece generated even more stress for Turkey on the 27th when its prime minister threatened that its armed forces would "teach the Turks a very hard lesson" if Turkey continued its "aggressive acts." In a further escalatory act the same day Premier Papandreou renewed his charge that the U.S. favored Turkey in their conflict and, more important, threatened to close U.S. bases in Greece if hostilities broke out between Greece and Turkey. The U.S. was asked to suspend operations at its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, northeast of Athens.  The armed forces of Greece and Turkey were put on alert. The Secretary-General of Turkey's General Staff, Brigadier-General Ergence, warned that any Greek act to disturb the Sizmik I would be countered by "unhesitating retaliation." NATO ambassadors called on the disputants, both NATO members, to do everything to prevent resort to violence. And NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington offered to mediate.  The crisis de-escalated abruptly. Later that day, 27 March, Prime Minister Turgut Ozol declared that Turkey would not prospect for oil outside its territorial waters unless Greece did so first. The next day Greece announced that it, too, would not explore for oil in disputed waters. And the NAPC announced that it had frozen plans to operate outside Greek territorial waters. Thus ended the third Aegean Sea crisis.  Neither the UN nor the USSR was involved. The U.S. was drawn in by virtue of its leadership role in NATO and the Western political community; but its activity was confined to political acts to help wind down the crisis between two NATO allies.  (Although the Greece/Turkey protracted conflict was relatively quiescent for almost a decade, it was far from resolved. This was evident from another minicrisis at the end of January 1996. The issue was sovereignty over two tiny (10 acre), uninhabited rock formations in the eastern Aegean Sea, known as Imia by Greece, and Kardak by Turkey, located four miles from the Turkish coast and 12 miles from the undisputed Greek island of Kalimnos in the Dodecanese chain. Both parties made unqualified claims of sovereignty, lodged diplomatic protests, and sent troops and warships to the islets. It was only the personal intervention of U.S. President Clinton that persuaded Greece and Turkey, nominally two NATO allies, to de-escalate the crisis, a replica of their two-day crisis in March 1984 (see Case #349--Aegean Sea II).
Nigeria experienced a minor border crisis with Cameroon from 2 May to 26 September 1987. The border between Cameroon and Nigeria is porous and imprecise at several points. On 2 May 1987 a small number of Cameroonian troops intruded into Nigeria's Borno Province, triggering a crisis for Nigeria. (However, on 1 July Nigeria's President Babangida described it as a minor incident.) Nigeria’s major response was to increase border security. On 24 September Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff, Major-General Abacha, visited Cameroon--to affirm the "commitment of Nigeria toward peace and progress and toward the stability and peaceful coexistence between Cameroon and Nigeria." Abacha said that his visit had given the two countries an opportunity to correct some wrong impressions. Two days later, on 26 September, a joint military border patrol was formed to monitor the border. That act terminated a low-intensity crisis in West Africa. The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis. (On 29 September, Cameroon's Army Chief of Staff arrived in Nigeria: Brigadier-General James held talks at the airport with General Abacha on the incursions into Nigeria by Cameroonian soldiers. Relations between Nigeria and Cameroon entered a new positive phase following the visit of Babangida to Cameroon on 8-11 December. This did not, however, prevent other border incidents, including one full-scale crisis [see Case #410--Cameroon/Nigeria III, in 1993-94].)
Prolonged ethnic strife in Sri Lanka generated a crisis with India from 3 June to 30 July 1987. The roots of this South Asian crisis lay in the one-way migration of Indian Tamils to Ceylon (later, Sri Lanka) during the extended period of British rule: from 1757 to 1947 in the Indo/Pakistani subcontinent, from 1796 to 1948 in Ceylon. During the nineteenth century Indian Tamils, pushed by the endemic poverty of their homeland, the South Indian province of Madras (later, Tamilnadu), and pulled by the opportunities for employment in the labor-intensive rubber plantations of Ceylon, migrated in large numbers. By the time of independence, the Hindu Tamils comprised approximately 20 percent of Ceylon's population, with a vast majority of Buddhist Sinhalese.  From the outset the Tamils, concentrated in the northern Jaffna Peninsula, perceived acute discrimination in all aspects of Sri Lanka's society, economy, and polity. Ethnic resentment erupted into open rebellion in 1983 under the leadership of the most militant and disciplined Tamil group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the LTTE, best known as "the Tamil Tigers" or "the Tigers." Their goal for more than a decade has been an independent state for the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the vast majority of whom reside in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. There have been several escalation points in an increasingly bitter ethnic conflict. One was a large-scale offensive launched by Sri Lanka's armed forces against the Tamil Tigers on 26 May 1987, "Operation Liberation." Not for the first time, the plight of their ethnic and religious kin generated a massive pressure group in Tamilnadu, a state in south India, which urged the government of India to intervene on behalf of Sri Lanka's Tamils. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi repeated earlier calls for restraint by Sri Lanka's government and urged a resolution of the conflict through negotiation. On 1 June India's high commissioner (ambassador) to Sri Lanka conveyed a proposal to send unarmed Indian ships, under Indian Red Cross auspices, to deliver relief supplies to the Tamils of Jaffna. Following an emergency cabinet meeting, Sri Lanka's government stated on the 2nd its willingness to consider the idea but vigorously opposed "unilateral action" by India which, it added, would be regarded as a violation of its "independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity." On 3 June a flotilla of 19 Indian fishing boats sailed from the Tamilnadu port of Rameswaram, carrying food, medicine, and kerosene. Officials from the Indian Red Cross and India's External Affairs Ministry and many journalists were aboard. Three hours later, at 5:00 p.m., the Indian flotilla was stopped by Sri Lankan patrol boats off Kachchative Island and denied entry into Sri Lanka's territorial waters.  After four hours of futile talks, the Indian boats returned to Rameswaram. Sri Lanka's act triggered a crisis for India, posing a threat to its regional primacy. New Delhi's initial response, on 4 June, was a plan devised by the Indian cabinet's Political Affairs Committee, its standing crisis management body, to air-drop relief supplies to the Tamils in Jaffna. The plan was implemented the same day: five transport planes, escorted by four Mirage fighter aircraft, dropped 22 tons of supplies over the Jaffna Peninsula.  This unilateral Indian operation triggered a crisis for Sri Lanka, a direct challenge to its sovereignty over its northern province. Colombo, angered by the half-hour notice of the Indian operation--India claimed it had informed Sri Lanka three hours earlier--sent a formal complaint to New Delhi charging India with a clear violation of Sri Lanka's territorial integrity. Soon after, both parties followed the path of negotiation. The result was an interim agreement on 15 June, which permitted unarmed Indian vessels, without escort, to deliver relief supplies to Sri Lankan officials in Jaffna, for distribution to the Tamil residents. This agreement marked the end of the high stress crisis period but not yet of the crisis as a whole.  Food shipments began on 24 June and continued in July. Negotiations were held quietly at a high level. On 16 July President Jayawardene and members of the Sri Lanka cabinet met with India's high commissioner. A formal peace plan was submitted to Delhi on the 18th. Sri Lanka's parliament approved the plan on the 22nd. There was a setback on the 27th, when the Tiger leader, Prabhakaran, rejected the proposal. The next day, under pressure from India's prime minister, he softened his opposition. And four other militant Tamil groups indicated their support for the peace plan. Finally, during a festive visit to the island on 29-30 July by India's prime minister, an agreement was formally signed by all of the interested parties. Sri Lanka agreed to merge the Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern Provinces into one province. An island-wide cease-fire agreement went into effect. And India undertook to provide a peacekeeping force for the Tamil majority areas of Sri Lanka. To that end, 3,000 Indian soldiers arrived in Jaffna on 30 July to supervise the disarming of Tamil militants. Moreover, Indian planes transported 600 Sri Lankan troops to the capital, Colombo, to assist the police in asserting control over large numbers of Sinhalese demonstrating against the accord. With the agreement of 30 July, the India/Sri Lanka crisis over the Tamils of the island came to an end.  The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.  The domestic ethnic conflict continues.
Sa'udi Arabia and Iran were embroiled in a crisis over Iranian pilgrims from 31 July to October 1987. No pilgrimage by Iranians to Islam's Holy Places since 1981 had passed without incident. Their annual demonstrations in the streets of Mecca and Medina challenged the Sa'udi concept of pilgrimage, the Sa'udi interpretation of Islam, Sa'udi control of the Holy Places, and the legitimacy of Sa'udi rule.  The first catalyst to tension between Iran and Sa'udi Arabia in 1987 was a statement by Iran's former pilgrimage representative, Musavi Khoiniha, a powerful hard-line figure in Iran. In a speech early in July Khoiniha reportedly said that a mere march or demonstration by Iranians would not suffice. He demanded that the Sa'udi regime allow Iranian pilgrims to enter the Great Mosque in Mecca at the end of their demonstration, where their representative would explain Iran's case regarding the Iran/Iraq War. That demand put the Sa'udi security forces on a high state of alert.  After difficult negotiations Iranian and Sa'udi officials reached an agreement that the demonstration would end half a kilometer before the Great Mosque. But tension remained high, so Sa'udi Arabia tried to persuade the Iranian pilgrimage representative, Hojjatolislam Mehdi Karrubi, to cancel the demonstration lest violence break out. Karrubi refused and declared that the Sa'udi government would be responsible for any disorder.  On 28 July Ayatullah Khomeini called on all Iranian pilgrims to take part in a "disavowal march" to "echo the crushing slogan of the disavowal of pagans and apostates of world arrogance, headed by the criminal USA," adding that "it is most disgraceful for Islamic countries and for heads of states that foreigners should penetrate the secret military centers of the Moslems." At the same time Iran's ruler called on the pilgrims "to avoid clashes, insults and disputes" and warned against those "intent on disruption." On 31 July 1987, during the annual Haj (pilgrimage) to Mecca, several hundred people were killed and many wounded in violent clashes between Sa'udi security forces and Iranian pilgrims. The clashes began during the demonstration of Iran's pilgrims: toward its end the march approached Sa'udi security guards, who refused to allow the demonstrators to move closer to the Great Mosque.  The Iranian demonstrators were invoking death threats against the U.S., Israel, and the Soviet Union. A confrontation began between the pilgrims and the Sa'udi security forces: the Sa'udis opened fire on the demonstrators. This incident triggered a crisis for Sa'udi Arabia and Iran that day.  Sa'udi Arabia denied firing on the pilgrims, claiming that those who were killed were crushed in a trample. Iran gave another version of the events, claiming that "Sa'udi police, in a pre-arranged joint Sa'udi-U.S. conspiracy ... opened fire on Iranian pilgrims who were peacefully marching."  Iran's initial response, on 1 August, was to call for the overthrow of the Sa'udi regime. And 2 August was declared an official "Day of Hate" in Iran. The Iranian parliamentary Speaker (later, President of Iran), Hashemi Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, called for revenge, by "freeing the holy shrines from the mischievous and wicked Wahabis" and stated that "the Imam (Khomeini) dictates, [Sa'udi King] Fahd will not remain alive." The Iranian media accused the U.S. of responsibility for the "massacre."  Sa'udi spokesmen responded by accusing the Iranians of deliberate provocation. The Sa'udis refused to allow an Iranian delegation to enter Sa'udi Arabia on 2 August to investigate the deaths and to interview security officials.  On 25 August, for the first time, a senior Sa'udi official, Prince Na'if, sharply attacked Iran and publicly called for the overthrow of the regime in Teheran. The two sides continued to exchange accusations and insults throughout September. Late that month, Sa'udi Arabia denied Iran's accusation that it was unwilling to return 54 corpses of Iranian pilgrims who died in the clashes in Mecca. And at a UN General Assembly meeting on 22 September Iran's President Khamenei uttered threats against Sa'udi Arabia, which the Sa'udi delegate described as "meaningless" and totally unjustified.  The crisis faded in October 1987, with a Sa'udi victory and Iranian defeat.  The Arab states supported the Sa'udis, except for Libya, which advocated placing the Mecca and Medina mosques under international Islamic control.  The U.S., the USSR, the UN, and the Arab League were not involved in this crisis.
Angola and South Africa were embroiled in another of their many cross-border crises from 3 October 1987 to 22 August 1988. A crisis for Angola was triggered by a South Africa Defence Forces attack on SWAPO bases in Angolan territory on 3 October 1987. This was one of a number of such intrusions by the SADF since 1978, noted above, part of Pretoria's continuing struggle to thwart SWAPO's attempt to create an independent state of Namibia in South African-controlled South-West Africa. For Angola the incursion posed a threat of grave damage. For South Africa, Angola's provision of sanctuary to SWAPO forces threatened its control over South-West Africa and, generally, its primacy in the southern African region.  Angola's initial response followed its behavior in earlier intrusions of this kind: it appealed to the UN Security Council. As in the past, the Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning South Africa's "continued and intensified acts of aggression" against Angola and called for the immediate, unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Angola's territory. However, it did not impose economic sanctions on Pretoria.  This routinized Security Council behavior did not, per se, catalyze a crisis for South Africa. The trigger occurred on 10 December, when Angola launched a counterattack against SADF units.  Serious clashes between the SADF and Angolan forces continued intermittently for months, intertwined with the ongoing civil war in Angola between the MPLA-led government and UNITA. The latter's leader, Jonas Savimbi, claimed on 12 November that his forces had repulsed a three-month offensive by government forces. In mid-December, the Head of the SADF, General Johan Geldenhuys, admitted for the first time that his troops were fighting alongside UNITA inside Angola. Government forces had the active backing of 2,000 Soviet military advisors and of a large Cuban contingent in reserve, estimated as 30,000-35,000 troops.  The winding down of this cross-border crisis was a slow process that involved multiple mediation efforts. The first of twelve rounds of mediation among Angola, Cuba and South Africa began under the chairmanship of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Chester Crocker, from 2-4 May 1988 in London. Also notable, a later round of mediated negotiations in New York during July produced a 14-point agreement entitled “Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in Southwestern Africa,” which served as a roadmap for further negotiations. Moreover, from 2-5 August the parties met in Geneva, where the U.S. delegation worked out the details for the Geneva Protocol, which recommended 1 November 1988 to the UN Secretary-General as the date for the implementation of Resolution 435, set 1 September as the date to resolve any other underlying issues and the date by which South Africa must be fully out of Angola, prepared text for a trilateral treaty that would make the New York “Principles” binding, and created an effective end to the Angolan border war. Angola and South Africa signed a cease-fire agreement on 22 August 1988, the Ruacana Accord, with a mutual commitment to continue talks on the issue of a complete SADF withdrawal. This ended the crisis--but not the protracted conflict between Angola and South Africa. (A substantive agreement on withdrawal and disengagement of forces was signed by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa on 22 December 1988.)  The UN role was limited to its routinized condemnation of South Africa's military incursion into Angola. More forceful Security Council action, notably economic sanctions, was prevented by the threat of a U.S. veto. For years the Reagan administration had provided South Africa and UNITA with covert aid.  Moreover, its policy of "constructive engagement" with Pretoria included preventing any sanctions by the global organization. Complementing this policy, U.S. relations with Angola had steadily deteriorated after July 1985, when the U.S. Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, which had imposed legal restrictions on U.S. assistance to UNITA. Export credit funds to Angola were cut off. And pressure was put on U.S. oil firms to cease their operations in oil-rich Angola, so as to deny funds to the pro-Soviet MPLA-led Angolan government. Both the USSR and Cuba, as noted, provided substantial military aid to government forces.  (South Africa Intervention in Angola was the last international crisis of the Angola protracted conflict: the December 1988 accord was fully implemented by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa. And with the active involvement of the U.S., Russia, and South Africa, Namibia's independence became a reality in 1990.  There were several abortive peace agreements over the years, notably the Angola Peace Accords (Bicesse Accords) on 31 May 1991, and the UN-supervised elections in September 1992. The electoral outcome, a decisive MPLA victory, was rejected by UNITA, and large-scale violence was renewed. However, the 20-year-old civil war, the primary source of the Angola PC and its international crises, appeared to be winding down.  A peace agreement, the Lusaka Protocol, was signed in November 1994 between the MPLA-dominated government of Angola and the UNITA movement. Their leaders, dos Santos and Savimbi, had a public reconciliation in Lusaka in early May 1995, their first meeting since the ill-fated UN-organized Angola elections in 1992. After further negotiations, Angola's president announced in August 1995 that they had agreed to a merger--and large-scale demobilization--of their armed forces, as well as the formation of a coalition government in which Savimbi would serve as Vice President. But the deadline for the UN-sponsored demobilization, 8 February 1996, passed with little progress in this crucial domain of the Lusaka peace process. Still another agreement between dos Santos and Savimbi was reported at a meeting in Libreville, the capital of Gabon, on 1 March 1996. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Lusaka Accord. The UNITA leader pledged the completion of the demobilization of his forces and the creation of an integrated national army, along with the assumption of ministerial posts by UNITA, including the vice presidency by Savimbi--as provided in the Accord. However, the internal Angola conflict was not yet fully resolved).
Laos and Thailand were enmeshed in another crisis over disputed territory from 3 November 1987 to 17 February 1988. In May 1987 Laos accused Thailand of massing troops close to the northern border, in order to protect illegal logging activities. Laos launched several attacks on Thai loggers, killing some of them. A crisis for Laos and Thailand was triggered simultaneously on 3 November 1987 when heavy fighting broke out in the disputed three village area (see Case #353--Three Village Border I). Laos claimed that the fighting began with Thai air and artillery attacks on Laotian soldiers in the Boten district of its Sayaboury Province. Thailand said it was attacking Laotian troops who had invaded the Chat Trakan district of its Phitsaulok Province.  Thailand's initial response was "Operation Soi Dao," designed to clear the disputed region of Laotian troops. Its major response occurred on 15 December when Thai F5 fighter planes bombed Laotian positions in the region. Laos appealed to the UN Secretary-General to intervene; Perez de Cuellar offered his good offices.  As heavy fighting continued, Laos agreed on 28 December to a third round of border talks with Thailand. However, by mid-January 1988 Thailand claimed that it had reasserted control over 70 percent of the area around Hill 1428. Fighting intensified on 1-2 February, as Thai planes launched heavy strikes against Laotian troop positions.  Talks between the two states, aimed at ending the armed border conflict, began on 16 February in Bangkok. Laos was represented by the Chief of the General Staff of the Laotian People's Army, General Sisavat Keobounphan. Thailand sent General Chaovalit Yongchaiyut, the commander of the Thai army.  The military leaders signed a cease-fire agreement on 17 February calling on their governments to begin negotiations to solve the dispute by the end of the month. That agreement terminated the crisis for both sides. (The cease-fire took effect two days later.)
Kenya and Uganda experienced a brief border crisis from 14 to 28 December 1987. Tension between these East African neighbors increased as a result of Uganda's decision in May 1987 to transport its coffee crop and fuel by its own national railroad, which was less expensive than the Kenyan road system. Kenya retaliated by imposing strict border controls on traffic from Uganda, which caused heavy delays. Uganda blamed Kenya for closing the border unilaterally. Both states perceived a crisis the same day, 14 December 1987. Ugandan troops reportedly crossed the border first, near the town of Busia, triggering a crisis for Kenya. In the clashes that ensued, which triggered a crisis for Uganda, 15 Ugandans were reportedly killed. On the 18th Kenya ordered Uganda's high commissioner to leave the country.  President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya and President Museveni of Uganda met at the border town of Malaba on the 28th and agreed on a series of steps to ease the tension. Security forces were to be pulled back from the frontier by both sides and replaced by regular police. Moreover, the border was to be reopened to regular traffic. These conciliatory acts terminated the crisis.  There was no involvement by the UN, the OAU, the U.S., or the USSR in this crisis.
Honduras and Nicaragua were enmeshed in another crisis generated by the contra rebellion from 6 to 28 March 1988. Peace talks between the Nicaraguan regime and the contra rebels, initiated by President Arias of Costa Rica, led to a cease-fire agreement in March 1987. However, the U.S. Congress's approval of $48 million of nonmilitary aid to the contras on 30-31 March led to a contra violation of the cease-fire.  In August 1987, as a conciliatory gesture, Nicaragua withdrew the complaint it had submitted to the World Court in July 1986 against Honduras and Costa Rica, charging that they were providing the contras with sanctuaries for raids into its territory. The pattern of cross-border raids by the contras, retaliation by Nicaragua, cease-fire agreements, and violations by one or both of the parties continued through the autumn of 1987. Another cease-fire agreement in October broke down amid renewed Nicaraguan charges of CIA-organized air drops of military supplies to the contras in November. And in December the contras intensified their cross-border attacks into Nicaragua. This phase of low-intensity violence culminated in a major Nicaraguan offensive against contra camps in Honduras on 6 March 1988, triggering a crisis for Honduras. President Azcona del Hoyo responded on 15 March with an appeal for U.S. assistance. The next day Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega denied that an incursion had occurred and invited observers from the UN and the OAS. On the 16th, too, the U.S., patron of the contras and of Honduras, replied to the latter's appeal by ordering the immediate dispatch of 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras, triggering a crisis for Nicaragua. On the 17th U.S.-supplied Honduran fighter planes bombed Nicaraguan troops operating in the border zone. And Honduras's president threatened further land attacks if Nicaragua's troops were not withdrawn across the border.  The crisis began to wind down on 17 March, when Nicaragua ended its military incursion. On the 19th Nicaragua renewed its case before the World Court, accusing Honduras of "complicity and active participation ... in the bombings and acts of aggression, promoted by the U.S. government, against Nicaragua." Crisis termination was signaled on 28 March by the beginning of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Honduras.  (Three days later, as a quid pro quo, Nicaragua once more suspended its suit against Honduras before the World Court.)  Although the UN and the OAS were approached by Nicaragua for observers, none was dispatched. In general, these two international organizations, along with the USSR, were not involved in this Central American crisis.
Vietnam and China were embroiled in a crisis over the Spratly Islands from 14 March until late April 1988. The Spratlys and the South China Sea generally had long been part of the territorial domain of imperial China. Control by the "Middle Kingdom," however, eroded along with its decline as the regional hegemon during the penetration of European powers into Southeast Asia in the sixteenth century. But the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys remained dormant until the late nineteenth century.  France emerged as the dominant power in Indochina and the islands of the South China Sea, a status formalized in the France/Annam treaty of 1874. China was compelled to accept France's primacy following the defeat of its navy in the Sino/French war of 1884-85. Extending its influence southward from its Indochina colony, France sent a survey mission to the Spratlys in 1927 and formally annexed the islands in April 1930.  Japan emerged as the next claimant: with most of coastal China under Japan's control early in the Sino/Japanese war (see Case #56--Marco Polo Bridge, in 1937-38, in China/Japan PC), the Japanese navy occupied the Spratlys in March 1939. The Itu Aba Island within the Spratly archipelago became a submarine base for Japan's invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. And the Spratlys assisted the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia.  At the end of World War II, (Republican) China reasserted its claim to the Spratlys. So too did France, now restored to control over Indochina. China established a military post on Itu Aba. In October 1950 the newly (formally) independent Vietnam proclaimed possession of France's maritime boundaries in the South China Sea, including the Spratlys. And with the end of French rule in 1956, following its dramatic defeat at Dien Bien Phu two years earlier (see Case #145, in Indochina PC), South Vietnam dispatched a military unit to the islands.  The legal status of the Spratlys remains uncertain. The San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 ending the Pacific War failed to resolve the dispute. It remained dormant for the next two decades because the two major contenders were preoccupied: mainland China, with the consolidation of communist power; Vietnam, with the long war against the United States.  Competing claims became more visible in the early 1970s. In July 1971, following the firing on a Filipino ship by a Taiwan navy patrol in the waters of the Spratlys, the Philippines claimed ownership of 53 islets in the eastern part of the far-flung Spratly archipelago. The PRC occupied the Paracel Islands in 1974, signaling its intent to reassert China's historic claim to the Spratlys. North Vietnam declared its sovereignty over the Spratlys in April 1975, following its victory in the Vietnam War and the unification of the two Vietnams. Then, in 1978, Malaysia asserted its claim to 10 atolls in the southern part of the Spratlys. In short, by that time there were five claimants to sovereignty over all or part of the Spratlys: China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The Sultan of Brunei put forward a claim to part of the islands in 1988, adding Indonesia to the disputants.  China served notice of its intent in December 1984 when the PRC's State Council announced the integration of the Paracel and Spratly Islands into the Hainan administrative zone. With the legitimacy of a UNESCO decision in March 1987, assigning it the task of setting up observation posts in the Spratlys, Beijing reportedly established 167 posts by the end of that year. On 16 April 1987 the PRC made its intent unequivocal, with a statement that China "reserved the right to recover [the Spratlys] at an appropriate time." And in May-June 1987 it conducted naval exercises near the Spratlys.  Not by accident, China selected Vietnam as the focus of an even more tangible expression of its claim to the Spratlys. Vietnam was an historic enemy-rival of China. It was still a pariah state, the only state in the region that was not a member of ASEAN with which China had carefully nurtured an image of a friendly great power and increasingly important trading partner. Vietnam was further weakened by the decline of the Soviet Union, its military and economic patron through the Vietnam War and beyond. And the U.S. had not yet embarked on a policy of reconciliation with Vietnam. PRC forces took possession of two reefs in the Spratlys on 31 January 1988. Near clashes between the navies of China and Vietnam were frequent in January and February. On 24 February Vietnam accused China of violating its sovereignty over the Spratlys and warned of "disastrous consequences." China responded on the 26th, repeating its claims and warning that Vietnam "must take full responsibility for all the consequences" if it "obstructs China's legitimate activities" in the Spratlys. A crisis was triggered for Vietnam and, almost simultaneously, for China on 14 March 1988: a brief (half-hour) naval battle left two Vietnamese ships destroyed, with three Vietnamese soldiers killed and 74 missing. A defeated Vietnam's proposal on the 24th for negotiations was rejected. Both sides upgraded their forces and deployed troops to several contested islands and reefs during the ensuing weeks. Nonetheless, the crisis began to wind down in April and faded by the end of that month.  Several of the other parties to the dispute over the Spratly Islands were involved actors. The Philippines warned both Vietnam and China on 17 March not to intrude into the area it claimed. An agreement was signed by a Philippines congressional delegation and Vietnam at the beginning of April committing both to non-violent means of settling the dispute. Similarly, China and the visiting president of the Philippines agreed in late April to set their dispute aside. Malaysia and Taiwan adopted a more bellicose response: the former increased its patrols around the islets it claimed and, in August 1988, announced its intention of building a naval base on the north coast of Sabah; the latter reinforced its garrison on Itu Aba Island in March. But all this was posturing designed to buttress claims to part of the Spratlys.  The U.S., the USSR, the UN, and ASEAN were not involved in this crisis.  (Physical and verbal expressions of hostility continued through June. Vietnam conducted a large military exercise in May clearly designed to cope with an anticipated battle against the Chinese in the Spratlys. China deployed additional units to Spratly reefs in May; and they held a military exercise in June, reportedly simulating a tactical nuclear attack. Moreover, there were exchanges of undisguised threats by both sides. But, while the conflict continued--and the dispute remains unresolved in the late 1990s--the crisis triggered by the naval battle of 14 March had passed.)
Iran experienced its last intra-war crisis (IWC) of the eight-year Iran/Iraq War from 18 April to 8 August 1988. The long war in the Gulf region began in September 1980 when Iraq invaded its neighbor (see Case #317). There were several IWCs in the following years (see Cases #335, #348, #361 in 1982, 1984, 1986). Both sides suffered heavy casualties. There was little change in the strategic balance. And for most of the time the protagonists were locked in a stalemate.  The key Iraqi port of al-Faw at the entrance to the long-disputed Shatt-al-Arab estuary (see Cases #172, #234), with a history of conflict over this waterway going back to the Ottoman period before World War I, had fallen to Iran on 9 February 1986. On 14 May 1986 Iraqi forces made their first land incursion into Iran since the battle for Khorramshahr in 1982. For the last two years of the war there was a renewed stalemate. Iraq's primary goal in this phase was to damage the Iranian economy, notably its oil exports. Iran's objectives were to punish Iraq as the initiator of the costly war, to oust Saddam Hussein from power in Baghdad, and to receive massive war reparations from Iraq. In light of these goals Iran rejected several Iraqi offers of a cease-fire, including one by Saddam Hussein in January 1987: on 12 February Ayatullah Khomeini declared that the war against Iraq was a "Holy Crusade" that could end only in victory. On 20 March 1988 Khomeini reaffirmed his determination to persist until final victory.  Iran used its Kurdish allies in a war of attrition against Iraq in the mountainous north. Iraqi planes continued to attack tankers in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, in an attempt to undermine Iran's capability to sustain the long war. The naval war in the Gulf was internationalized in the spring of 1987, including an Iraqi attack on a U.S. frigate in the Gulf on 17 May, changing U.S. attitudes toward Gulf War I, but not to the extent of making Washington a direct participant. Iran and Iraq exchanged air raids on civilian targets in many cities of the two warring states, including Baghdad and Teheran. Iran also renewed pressure on Kuwait to desist from further material aid to Iraq, by naval attacks on Bubiyan Island on 30 March and 20 April 1988. On 18 April 1988, after a fierce battle, Iraqi forces recaptured the port of al-Faw, the first of a series of victories that would lead to the end of the war. Iraq launched another successful offensive on 25 May on the town of Shalamchech, which Iran had occupied in January 1987. An Iranian counteroffensive was unsuccessful. Nonetheless Iran refused all UN entreaties to negotiate with Iraq, directly or even indirectly.  In late May the UN Secretary-General began a new cease-fire initiative, but neither of the protagonists was receptive. On 2 June Iran, through its new commander-in-chief of the armed forces (and later, president), Rafsanjani, declared that there would be no compromise. On 18 June Iraq began a new offensive, attacking Mehran. A week later it reconquered Majnoon Island and the northern outskirts of Basra.  By the summer of 1988 Iran had yielded all of its military gains of the preceding six years. It was a turning point in the war, indicating that defeat was possible, and for Iraq, a signal that victory was attainable. Saddam Hussein declared on 28 June that "final victory is very near"; and on 12 July Iraq began to advance into Iran. From a position of strength Iraq proposed peace talks on the 18th. The two superpowers and the UN also pressed for negotiations, through Security Council Resolution 598. Iran, suffering from a shortage of arms and several defeats on the battlefield, and under growing external pressure from the major powers, agreed to negotiate: on 20 July Khomeini announced Iran's acceptance of a cease-fire, a decision he described as "more deadly than taking poison." Iraq, however, insisted on direct negotiations on all aspects of the conflict. The fighting, the last IWC, and the Iran/Iraq War ended on 8 August 1988.  (None of the basic issues in dispute, including borders, was resolved by the war. The two Gulf powers had suffered massive losses and were weakened, internally and externally.)
The United States and Libya were engaged in a brief, dramatic crisis from 21 December 1988 to 12 January 1989. During the 1980s there were several violent incidents between Libya and the U.S., including two crises over the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra) (see Cases #330 and #363). Tension flared again at the end of 1988. A crisis for the U.S. was triggered by the crash of a Pan American plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988: Libya was the prime suspect in the explosion that caused the deaths of 257 passengers, most of them U.S. citizens. This dramatic catalyst was reinforced by U.S. intelligence reports that Libya had embarked on the production of chemical weapons at a plant near Rabta, 60 kilometers south of the capital, Tripoli. U.S. sanctions were imposed on Libya on 28 December.  At the beginning of 1989 a U.S. task force, headed by the aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy, was holding maneuvers in the central Mediterranean, near Libya. On 4 January two Libyan MIG-23s were shot down by two U.S. fighters over international waters, 110 kilometers from the Libyan coast, triggering a crisis for Libya.  The reaction in the international community was widespread criticism of U.S. actions. On 5 January the USSR, Libya's patron and arms supplier for a decade, accused the U.S. of "state terrorism" and "political adventurism." That day, too, only a U.K. veto saved the U.S. from an embarrassing European Community statement that failed to support the U.S. version of events. On 11 January a draft UN Security Council resolution deplored U.S. acts and called on the U.S. to suspend its military maneuvers off Libya's coast: the resolution was vetoed by France, the U.K., and the U.S. And the next day an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Islamic Conference condemned U.S. aggression. A visible decline in tension between Libya and the U.S. from that day marked the end of their third crisis in the 1980s.
Senegal and Mauritania were enmeshed in a lengthy crisis from 21 August 1989 to 18 July 1991. Both were part of the French empire in West Africa. For many years they formed a single electoral unit and were represented by the same senator in France's legislature. Mauritania was separated from Senegal politically in 1946. The two states became independent in 1960, Senegal initially as part of the Mali Federation--along with Soudan (later, Mali), Upper Volta, and Dahomey--from which it seceded in August 1960 (see Case #177).  The population of Senegal is entirely black African, that of Mauritania mixed Arab in the north, black African in the south. The border region, the most arable part of Mauritania, was cultivated by black Africans, competing with Senegalese across the Senegal River for limited water resources. At the root of the interstate conflict was increasing desertification, which drove Arab nomadic herders south toward black African farmlands on both sides of the border. As the value of the arable land rose, Mauritania denied Senegalese access to its land.  A series of nonmilitary violent incidents occurred in April 1989, notably on "Black Tuesday," the 25th, when hundreds were killed and injured leading to a wave of refugees. By early June 75,000 Senegalese and 170,000 Mauritanians had been airlifted to their homelands. And in July Mauritanian officials were forcibly expelling thousands of Senegalese workers across the river boundary to Senegal. It was this economically driven tension and violence between the people of the two countries that led to the crisis trigger for both states: on 21 August Senegal's ambassador to Mauritania was declared persona non grata; and the same day Senegal severed diplomatic relations with Mauritania.  The first of several military clashes occurred in October 1989. The armed forces of both states were strengthened in November and later by a spillover from a long-standing hostility and rivalry between Syria and Iraq: the former supported Senegal, the latter, Mauritania. Heavy artillery was exchanged in January 1990 affecting villages on both sides of the border. And intermittent outbreaks of violence occurred during the next 18 months. This low-intensity African crisis ended on 18 July 1991 with an agreement in principle to restore diplomatic relations.  UN involvement was low-key--a fact-finding mission dispatched by the Secretary-General, which had no effect on crisis abatement. Mediation efforts on the part of the OAU – begun under the leadership of Egypt’s President Mubarak prior to the onset of the crisis – had a marginal effect in decreasing tensions and facilitating successful negotiation. Both the U.S. and the USSR were aloof from this crisis.
Cambodia and Vietnam experienced a shared crisis over the former's political system from 30 August 1989 to 27 January 1990. At the end of a lengthy, complex post-Vietnam War crisis in Indochina, Vietnam swept the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia in a swift military campaign and, on 7 January 1979, installed a puppet regime in Phnom Penh (see Case #284--Vietnam Invasion of Cambodia). During the next decade Vietnam was the de facto ruler of Cambodia with 160,000 troops stationed there. All attempts to end Vietnam's occupation failed. By the late 1980s, however, the declining power and foreign aid resources of Vietnam's patron, the Soviet Union, along with Vietnam's growing isolation in Southeast Asia, its internal economic stagnation, and the cumulative high cost of occupying Cambodia, created a favorable climate for a new diplomatic effort to resolve the conflict over Cambodia.  France and Australia took the lead in convening an international peace conference on Cambodia in Paris on 30 July 1989, with many other participants or observers: Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, the U.S., the USSR, Vietnam; and all the major Cambodian factions--the Armed National Sihanoukistes (ANS), led by former ruler Prince Norodom Sihanouk; the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), led by Son Sann, a former premier under Sihanouk; and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (the China-backed Khmer Rouge), comprising the anti-Vietnam Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK); and, on the other side, the Vietnam-created People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), led by Premier Hun Sen. Cambodia and its then-patron, Vietnam, perceived a crisis when the Paris conference was suspended on 30 August 1989 because of an irreconcilable disagreement over the place of the Khmer Rouge in a future Cambodian political system: the pro-Vietnam PRK regime was unalterably opposed to legitimizing a party responsible for genocide while in power from 1975 to 1979; and Sihanouk insisted on its inclusion, to avert a prolonged civil war. It was widely feared that the diplomatic deadlock would lead to the resumption of hostilities among the contending Cambodian factions. The expected escalation of military hostilities did, in fact, occur, especially because of the uncertainty accompanying Vietnam's withdrawal of its forces from Cambodia: it was publicly pledged on 5 April 1989 and was completed on 30 September, on schedule.  An attempt by Thailand's prime minister to arrange a cease-fire in September failed. However, the idea of an enlarged UN role in the Cambodian peace process, initiated by U.S. Congressman Stephen Solarz, revived the diplomatic effort. It took the form of a three-point peace plan formulated and urged upon all parties by Australia's Foreign Minister, Garth Evans. The plan called for the following: UN verification of Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia; a cease-fire and termination of external arms aid to all parties; and UN-supervised elections.  The Security Council approved the plan on 16 January 1990. China played a key role in enlisting the support of the three leaders of the anti-Vietnam coalition, Sihanouk, Son Sann, and the Khmer Rouge's Khieu Samphan. And Vietnam ensured the approval of the PRK regime--Hun Sen expressed his approval on 27 January. This marked the end of the crisis arising from the Cambodia peace conference.  Cambodia experienced a crisis because the Paris conference and pressure from the international community posed a threat to its political system, specifically, continued rule by the PRK. For Vietnam, its future influence in Indochina was at risk. China was actively involved, supplying weapons and diplomatic support to the Khmer Rouge, but it did not perceive a crisis for itself. The U.S. was marginally involved, primarily through Solarz’s initial efforts at formulating a peace plan and supporting the Australian diplomatic initiative. The USSR continued to provide military and diplomatic support to Vietnam.
The decade-old conflict between Nicaragua and the anti-Sandinista contras generated another crisis for Honduras from 9 September to 7 November 1989. Nicaragua had filed a complaint against both Honduras and Costa Rica with the International Court of Justice (World Court) in 1986, for allowing the contras to launch raids into Nicaragua from their territories. In a turning-point regional development, the heads of all five Central American states--Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua--met in Tela, Honduras, on 5-7 August 1989 and signed a declaration calling for the "voluntary demobilization, repatriation or relocation" of the contras in Nicaragua or in other countries within three months, beginning in September 1989, under the supervision of an international commission. On 7 August, too, in a bilateral agreement, Honduras agreed to the demobilization of the contras on its territory, in return for Nicaragua's withdrawal of its complaint against Honduras at the World Court. A crisis for Honduras was triggered by a Nicaraguan attack on several Honduran army posts on 9 September 1989. The Honduras Foreign Ministry protested the same day. On the 13th the head of Nicaragua's Military Intelligence responded that contra raids from Honduran bases had increased markedly in the preceding two weeks. (This turned out to be the only violent exchange during the crisis.)  In October, at the 43rd session of the UN General Assembly, the Honduras foreign minister called on the UN Secretary-General to create a multinational UN peacekeeping force to patrol the border with Nicaragua. The latter approved the idea. However, on 1 November President Ortega of Nicaragua declared a formal end to the cease-fire with the contras. This came in the aftermath of a contra attack on 22 October, in which 19 persons were killed. Ortega proposed meetings with contra leaders, the Honduras government, and the UN Demobilization Commission. Honduras responded sharply on 2 November, criticizing Ortega for his cancellation of the cease-fire and rejecting Nicaragua's call for new talks on demobilizing the rebel army, claiming that the peace agreement was sufficient.  The UN Security Council, responding to the Honduras foreign minister's request, adopted a resolution on 7 November that created an Observer Group in Central America to monitor compliance with the Tela Agreement and to patrol the borders between Honduras and Nicaragua. The 625-strong force included soldiers, observers and technicians from Canada, West Germany, Spain and other Latin American countries. Both the conflicting parties approved the resolution. This ended the crisis for Honduras and the Contras IV international crisis, for the UN Observer Group reduced tension and reduced the likelihood of further violence.  Nicaragua was a pivotally involved actor in this crisis. However, its source of threat was a nonstate actor, the contras, operating from a neighboring state, not Honduras per se: Nicaragua's leaders did not perceive value threat, time pressure, or higher probability of involvement in military hostilities with Honduras in this case.  The U.S. and the USSR were involved in the Nicaragua/contra domestic conflict but not in the interstate conflict between Honduras and Nicaragua.  (Talks between Nicaragua and the contras took place at UN headquarters on 9-10 November under the auspices of the UN-OAS International Commission for Support and Verification, with Honduras present as an observer.)
Morocco experienced another crisis with Polisario from 7 October to late November 1989. Although clashes erupted in January and August 1988, there was a marked shift toward diplomacy and accommodation that year. On 30 August Morocco and Polisario agreed to a UN-OAU peace plan aimed at ending their 13-year-old conflict for control of Western (former Spanish) Sahara. The plan called for a cease-fire and a referendum on self-determination among the people of the territory. This breakthrough was followed by the first meeting between senior officials of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with King Hassan of Morocco, on 4 January 1989 in Marrakesh.  The embryonic peace process was assisted by another basic change: on 16 May 1988 diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco were restored after a break of 12 years. Since Algeria had been the main source of military and political support for Polisario since 1975, this, too, augured well for a resolution of the conflict. The process was further reinforced on 17 February 1989 when, at a two-day summit of North African heads of state in Marrakesh, an Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) was proclaimed by Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Moreover, on 14 May the Algerian and Moroccan foreign ministers ratified a long-moribund agreement (signed in 1972) that settled their border dispute (see Case #199--Algeria/Morocco Border, in 1963, in Africa: Non-PCs). And on 5 August they signed a border and cooperation agreement.  In that atmosphere of peace-seeking, Polisario was compelled to restrain its military activity. However, when no significant progress was made in negotiations with Morocco since the meeting of January 1989, Polisario reverted to the path of violence. It began with a small-scale attack on 24 September in which four Moroccan soldiers were killed. This was followed by serious clashes in October-November, which threatened the agreements of the preceding year. On 7 October 1989 the Polisario Front broke the truce with an attack on Moroccan positions at Galtat Zemmour, its first major offensive since September 1988. This triggered a fresh crisis for Morocco. Another major attack occurred four days later. And despite the reconciliation between Morocco and Algeria in May 1988, Algeria continued to provide diplomatic support to Polisario. Thus the renewed fighting also posed a danger to the incipient accommodation between Algeria and Morocco.  Tension rose on the 9th when Morocco threatened military intervention in Mauritania if Polisario attacks from its territory continued. Four days later King Hassan declared that the Moroccan people had decided to fight "another 100 years if necessary" to defend its territory and sovereignty.  On 13 October UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar issued a report on the Western Sahara conflict, expressing the hope that further meetings between King Hassan and Polisario would take place, as the UN-OAU peace plan could only succeed if the two sides held direct negotiations.  On 7 November the SADR called for a dialogue with Morocco in order to achieve peace in Western Sahara. However, the next day Polisario launched a third massive attack against Moroccan forces at Amgala. And further clashes erupted on the 16th. Serious fighting ended in the second half of November 1989; and the crisis faded.  Because of the scale of Polisario attacks, Morocco suspected complicity by the Algerian military. Nonetheless the economic cooperation between Algeria and Morocco was sustained.  Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.  (Following a request by the UN Secretary-General, Polisario agreed to a truce on 21 February 1990 until the end of March, in order to create a positive atmosphere for UN peace efforts in the region.)  (A UN-brokered cease-fire in 1991 between Morocco and Polisario continues to hold with few violations. The agreement created a peacekeeping force, initially with 320 peacekeepers. And the parties agreed to a UN-supervised referendum, with two options for the tiny population of Western Sahara, 72,000 according to the last Spanish census in 1974: they could vote for integration into Morocco or for independence. Scheduled for January 1992, the referendum was repeatedly postponed.)
The United States and Panama were enmeshed in a military intervention crisis from 15 December 1989 to 3 January 1990. Washington played the decisive role in carving a sovereign state of Panama from Venezuela in 1903--in return for Panama's acceptance of U.S. construction and permanent control of the Panama Canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This gave the U.S. an enduring strategic interest in the domestic and external affairs of a small state at the southern tip of Central America. U.S. ownership of the Panama Canal Zone "in perpetuity" attested to the U.S. perception of a vital interest.  The "loss" of the Canal Zone was deeply resented by Panama's political and military elites. That resentment was expressed during a brief January 1964 crisis triggered by the raising of the U.S. flag in the Canal Zone by U.S. students, in violation of a December 1963 banning of both states' flags at Canal Zone schools (see Case #206--Panama Flag crisis).  The U.S. and Panama agreed to renegotiate the 1903 treaties, after diplomatic relations were restored in April 1964. In June 1967 Presidents Johnson and Robles reached agreement on three treaties, but strong opposition prevented their consideration in, let alone ratification by, the U.S. Congress. General Omar Torrijos, who seized power in Panama in 1968, renounced the agreements. President Nixon resumed the negotiations in 1970, and a set of principles was agreed upon in 1974. Once more, strong opposition by right-wing Republicans aborted ratification.  Finally, after prolonged and acrimonious negotiations, President Carter secured the ratification of two integrally related U.S.-Panama treaties, one in April 1978 providing for the transfer of the Canal Zone to Panamanian sovereignty in the year 2000, the second in September 1979, guaranteeing the Canal's permanent neutrality and the right of the U.S. to defend the Canal indefinitely into the future.  Viewed in larger regional and U.S. foreign policy perspectives, the 1989 invasion of Panama was a continuation of U.S. policy toward Central America and the Caribbean, and Mexico, throughout the twentieth century, another dramatic expression of the Monroe Doctrine of U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere (1823). That long-standing policy was evident in the prolonged U.S. occupation of Haiti (1915-34) and inter alia in many international crises: among them, Cases #2--Costa Rican Coup, in 1918-19, in Costa Rica/Nicaragua PC; #19--Costa Rica/Panama Border, in 1921, in Americas: Non-PCs; #33--Nicaragua Civil War I, in 1926-27, in Americas: Non-PCs. Since the end of World War II, U.S. intervention occurred in Cases #144--Guatemala, in 1953-54, and #181--Bay of Pigs, in 1961, in Multiregional PCs: East/West; #215--Dominican Intervention, in 1965, and #343--Invasion of Grenada, in 1983, both in Americas: Non-PCs; #354--Nicaragua MIG-21s, in 1984, in Multiregional PCs: East/West; and #383--Contras III, in 1988, in Honduras/Nicaragua PC. Both of Carter's Republican successors in the White House, Reagan (1981-89) and Bush (1989-93), perceived the revised Panama Canal treaties as an affront to U.S. primacy in the Western Hemisphere, an infringement of U.S. national security, and a threat to basic U.S. interests in the Caribbean. Moreover, during the last year of Reagan's presidency and the first two years of the Bush administration, Washington made persistent efforts to remove General Manuel Noriega, successor to Torrijos, from his dominant position in Panama's military and its political system.  The U.S. campaign to oust General Noriega began in February 1988 with the imposition of economic sanctions on Panama. In July Reagan considered covert military action against Noriega, but the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee objected and aborted the plan. Bush continued Reagan's policy; and in April 1989 he called for free elections in Panama. These were held on 7 May; but the results were nullified on the 10th. The next day Bush announced further economic measures against Panama: sanctions had seriously undermined Panama's economy by then.  An attempted coup against Noriega on 3 October 1989 failed. Five days later Secretary of State Baker confirmed U.S. complicity in that covert act. In short, the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 was the culmination of a prolonged U.S. covert campaign, which coincided with a two-and-a-half-year domestic political crisis within Panama. A crisis for the U.S. was triggered by an official statement in Panama City on 15 December proclaiming Noriega head of government. The next day a U.S. marine was killed by Panamanian soldiers. And Panamanian officials issued a declaration of a state of war with the United States. (Many critics, within the U.S. and abroad, regarded these events as a pretext for a long-planned invasion.)  Washington enunciated four reasons for the invasion: to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama; to defend democracy in Panama; to apprehend Noriega and to bring him to trial on charges of direct involvement in drug trafficking from South America to the United States; and to ensure the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties.  The decision to intervene was made by President Bush on 17 December. Its implementation, through an invasion force of 26,000 troops on the 20th in "Operation Just Cause," triggered a crisis for Panama. On 21 December Panama's church leaders, guardians of the May 1989 election results, proposed that the winning candidate, Endara, be proclaimed President. This occurred after Noriega's surrender on 3 January, following an intense 12-day military campaign against him and his National Guard. This marked the end of the Invasion of Panama crisis.  Both the USSR and the OAS condemned U.S. military action. So too did the UN: on 29 December the General Assembly adopted a resolution deploring the U.S. intervention as a violation of international law.  (Noriega was flown to Florida for a lengthy detention and trial, leading to long-term imprisonment. U.S. economic sanctions against Panama were lifted; and in May 1990 the U.S. Congress approved a $420 million aid package to support the new Endara regime. However, during the next five years Panama's leaders frequently complained about the niggardly transfer of aid funds from the U.S.)
India and Pakistan were enmeshed in another crisis over Kashmir, compounded by a near-nuclear confrontation, from 14 January until late June 1990. As noted, the India/Pakistan conflict over Jammu and Kashmir has persisted since the end of British rule on 15 August 1947, with a norm of high tension, a myriad of incidents, and two full-scale interstate crises (see Cases #119 and #216). There was also a Kashmir dimension to the crisis over Bangladesh (see Case #242). All through the 1980s anti-India forces in the India-occupied part of Kashmir pressed their opposition to continued Indian rule by (often violent) acts of disobedience, including the taking of hostages, foreign and Indian. A fresh Kashmir crisis for India was triggered on 14 January 1990, when, after weeks of escalating sectarian violence in Kashmir, Pakistan's foreign office expressed "deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir." As often in the past, India's external affairs ministry retorted the next day that Pakistan's statement was "an unacceptable interference in India's internal affairs," catalyzing a crisis for Pakistan. Many escalation points were to follow, including on 21 January 1990 when Indian police opened fire and killed 50 pro-independence demonstrators in the Vale of Kashmir (known as the Gawkadal massacre). The two foreign ministers met in Delhi on 21-23 January, without any breakthrough. On the 30th India's army chief of staff declared that India's troops were prepared to protect Kashmir's borders "at any cost." From January to April 1990 Indian Kashmir witnessed violent anti-India demonstrations and brutal suppression by an expanded Indian police and military presence: hundreds of Kashmiris were killed. Evidence that Pakistan was providing paramilitary training, weapons, and funds for Kashmiri militants in Pakistani-held Azad Kashmir and was organizing mass demonstrations in Srinagar against Indian rule only served to reinforce a near-universal conviction in India that Pakistan was responsible for the turmoil within Kashmir. On 6 April the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front seized--and killed--three Indian hostages. On the 11th India's Prime Minister V. P. Singh publicly warned his neighbor: "Our message to Pakistan is that you cannot get away with taking Kashmir without a war." And, ominously in that context, he added that Pakistan would not be permitted to achieve nuclear superiority. On 13, 15, and 16 April the USSR, Iran, and the U.S. expressed concern over the escalating tension in the subcontinent. At the same time India rejected a Pakistani proposal for a fresh UN observer role in Kashmir--there had been a small UN Observer Group in the disputed area since 1949. After a month of relative calm the crisis escalated on 21 May with the killing of Kashmir's leading Muslim cleric, Maulvi Muhammad Farooq, by unidentified gunmen. It escalated further when Indian security forces killed approximately 100 mourners in a vast throng of 100,000 attending the funeral. This incident, in turn, increased mutual suspicion and fear in both India and Pakistan, especially since, in the spring of 1990, both had deployed large numbers of troops in the desert borderlands of Rajasthan (India) and Sind (Pakistan). This movement of forces on both sides seemed like another tit-for-tat conventional military confrontation that triggered or escalated an international crisis (see Cases #135 and #372--Punjab War Scare I, II, in 1951 and 1987). However, in the spring of 1990 a large body of U.S.-intelligence-gathered evidence indicated an ominous dual change in South Asia's balance of power: first, that Pakistan now had a few operational nuclear weapons and that orders had been given by Pakistan's Army Chief of Staff, General Beg, to assemble them at Pakistan's nuclear center, Kahuta; and, second, that in order to prevent a repetition of its humiliating defeat by India in the war over Bangladesh in 1971 (see Case #242), Pakistani leaders were prepared to respond with a nuclear strike in case of an (anticipated) Indian invasion of Sind that aimed to cut the rump of West Pakistan into two. President Bush, alarmed by the growing risk of a miscalculated nuclear war in South Asia, sent Deputy Director of the CIA Robert Gates to Islamabad and Delhi on 20-21 May, along with Richard Haass (National Security Council aide for the region), and John Kelly (Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs): the delegation warned President Khan and General Beg that Pakistan would suffer a grave defeat in a war with India and could not expect any U.S. assistance in the event of war; and it warned India's Prime Minister Singh and Army Chief, General Sundarji, that Pakistan, in desperation, might resort to a nuclear strike. Both sides responded to the escalating crisis with important gestures. Pakistan's leaders agreed to close the training camps for Kashmiri militants. And India invited U.S. military attachés in Delhi to go to Kashmir and Rajasthan to see for themselves that an Indian invasion of Pakistan was not imminent. More important, on 3 June Pakistan began to withdraw its troops from the Indian border for use in reasserting law and order in Sind, where ethnic violence had erupted; and India responded by pulling its troops back from their forward deployment. The winding down of the crisis took several weeks. By late June 1990 the most dangerous India/Pakistan "war scare" had ended. The UN was not involved in this crisis. (Tension continued for several months. On 13 August, despite bilateral talks on confidence-building measures on 10-11 August, following an earlier round of talks on 18-19 July, Pakistan accused India of attacking a border post. There was an exchange of heavy artillery fire across the 1949 Kashmir cease-fire line on 20-21 August. By October 1990, with the formation of new governments in both states, India/Pakistan tension declined. The new prime ministers met on 22 November at the fifth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation [SAARC].)
Kuwait, the U.S., Iraq, and Sa'udi Arabia were the main participants in a crisis-war over the Gulf from 2 August 1990 to 12 April 1991. The other crisis actors were Bahrain, Egypt, France, Israel, Oman, Qatar, Syria, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the U.K., and the USSR. Iraq's oil production, which was vital to its economy, declined drastically during the Iran/Iraq War from 1980 to 1988 (see Iran/Iraq PC). As a result Iraq was experiencing great difficulty in repaying loans received during that war from Arab states, notably Kuwait and the UAE, amounting to billions of dollars. Iraq requested cancellation of the debts; they refused.  Iraq expounded two arguments. One was that, in carrying the full human and material burden of war against Iran, it was defending the vital interests of all Arab states in the Gulf region against a fundamentalist regime intent on establishing its hegemony and taking control of their vast oil resources. The second was that these loans derived mainly from the large increase in their oil revenues due to the sharp reduction in Iraq's oil exports during the war years. For both reasons, argued Iraq, these "loans" should be regarded as contributions to a common war effort and should be canceled. President Saddam Hussein's verbal attacks on Kuwait and the UAE began at an Arab League meeting on 28 May 1990. He accused them of waging economic war against Iraq by overproducing oil and causing a collapse in world oil prices. On 17 July, a week after the Gulf states agreed to cut their oil production, Hussein threatened that "if words fail to protect Iraq's interests, something effective must be done." The next day Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, accused Kuwait of stealing a vast amount of oil from the southern section of the disputed Rumaila oil field since 1980, worth $2.4 billion. Kuwait responded by placing its army on alert and by rejecting Iraq's claims and charges. Iraq moved forces to the Sa'udi Arabian border on the 23rd.  Talks between Iraq and Kuwait began on 31 July amid rising tension, despite informal mediation efforts by some Arab leaders. That day, too, six Iraqi divisions were concentrated along the border with Kuwait. The talks were suspended after only one session, when Kuwait rejected Iraq's demand for the strategically valuable Bubiyan and Warba islands. On 2 August 1990 Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait and occupied the emirate within six hours. This triggered the gravest of all possible crises for Kuwait, a threat to its existence as a state. The occupation of Kuwait and its huge oil resources was also perceived by the United States as a basic value threat. A U.S. statement on the 2nd condemned Iraq's invasion and called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of its legitimate government. The same day the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 660, the first of 15 during the crisis, calling for Iraq's complete and immediate withdrawal from Kuwait. The Arab League also condemned the invasion and called for Iraq's immediate withdrawal.  On the 3rd Iraqi forces concentrated on the Sa'udi Arabian border. In an emergency meeting on the 4th the Council of Europe decided to impose sanctions against Iraq. The UN Security Council, too, imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Iraq on 6 August.  A U.S. announcement on 7 August of its intent to deploy troops to Sa'udi Arabia marks the beginning of a massive military buildup of U.S. forces in the Gulf region. On the 8th the U.S. announced that up to 50,000 troops might be dispatched to Sa'udi Arabia to press for Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions.  Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) responded the same day by annexing Kuwait "in a comprehensive, eternal, and inseparable merger." On the 10th, 12 of the Arab League members supported a resolution to send a Pan-Arab force to Sa'udi Arabia: the decision obliged only the supporting states. NATO members decided at a special meeting in Brussels to respond individually to the crisis, not through collective action.  On 12 August Saddam Hussein initiated a "linkage" between the Gulf conflict and the Palestinian issue, a tactic he employed throughout the crisis to win support from the Arab and Muslim worlds. The U.S., the U.K., and Israel rejected the linkage. France and the European Community supported it.  In a further escalatory step on the 16th, Iraq took thousands of foreigners, mostly Westerners, as hostages. A UN resolution three days later demanded their release. On 21 September the RCC called on Iraq's citizens to prepare for the "mother of all battles." On the 23rd Saddam Hussein threatened to attack Sa'udi oil fields, unfriendly Arab states, and Israel if UN economic sanctions were to "strangle" Iraq.  On 30 October President Bush secretly approved a military plan to launch an air and naval strike against Iraq in mid-January 1991 and a ground campaign in February. This decision triggered a full-scale crisis for the U.S. because it generated the three defining conditions of a crisis--basic value threat, namely the human and material costs of war, finite time, and the higher likelihood of military hostilities. In a follow-up action, Bush announced on 8 November the deployment of 150,000 more troops to the Gulf region. Hussein responded by announcing on the 19th the deployment of 250,000 more troops to Kuwait and southern Iraq.  On 29 November, at U.S. urging, the Security Council adopted Resolution 678, authorizing the "use (of) all necessary means" by member-states to secure Iraq's compliance with all its earlier resolutions: it specified a deadline of 15 January 1991 for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, triggering a crisis for Iraq and for the U.S.'s allies as well--all the other crisis actors noted previously. Saddam Hussein rejected the resolution the next day. In a conciliatory gesture on 30 November, Bush offered to invite Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, to Washington and to send the U.S. Secretary of State, James Baker, to Baghdad soon after "to discuss all aspects of the Gulf Crisis." The RCC accepted the offer of high-level talks. And on 6 December Hussein announced the release of all foreign hostages.  The Gulf states met in Doha on the 22nd for a summit meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). They noted that the multinational force was coming "at the request of the GCC and will leave the region when the GCC states request." They also called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and reparations payment for the damage done.  On 2 January 1991 NATO decided to dispatch aircraft to protect Turkey from a possible Iraqi attack. A coalition of 28 states was formed, led by the U.S.: its most visible members were the U.K., France, and three Arab states, Sa'udi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria. The USSR was not an active member of the coalition but supported all UN resolutions during the crisis, including authorization of military action against Iraq. At the same time, Moscow took some dramatic diplomatic initiatives to resolve the crisis and prevent military intervention against Iraq.  The Aziz-Baker meeting took place in Geneva on 9 January: it ended in total impasse. On the 11th Baker requested Sa'udi approval of U.S. plans to intervene; and on the 15th Bush made a formal commitment to war. The U.S. informed the Sa'udi and Israeli ambassadors and coalition leaders of the decision on the 16th. The Soviet foreign minister was informed early in the morning of 17 January that coalition forces would attack Iraq an hour later. The USSR asked for additional time to make a last attempt to influence Saddam Hussein; and almost immediately after the war began it urged Iraq's leader to announce the beginning of a withdrawal from Kuwait.  The war, named "Operation Desert Storm," began with a massive bombardment of Iraq. Iraq responded with antiaircraft fire; but the U.S.-led coalition force had enormous superiority in firepower. Iraq retaliated by launching Scud missiles against Sa'udi Arabia and Israel. Intensive U.S. pressure succeeded in preventing an Israeli military riposte. In the early days of the war many of Iraq's most advanced planes flew to Iran for sanctuary. During the 38-day air campaign Iraq experienced saturation bombing.  The USSR was quiet during the first three weeks of Operation Desert Storm. In February President Gorbachev launched a high-profile mediation campaign to end the war. On the 9th the Soviet leader publicly condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, warned the U.S. against going beyond the mandate defined by the UN, and called upon Saddam Hussein to adopt "realism." A Soviet mission to Baghdad by an academic specialist on Asia, Yevgeny Primakov, led to Iraq's conditional offer on the 15th: withdrawal from Kuwait; a guarantee of all Iraq's "historical rights"; abdication by the ruling al-Sabah family of Kuwait; and Israel's complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. The offer was categorically rejected. A Tariq Aziz visit to Moscow on 17 February then generated a six-point plan on the 22nd. The U.S. rejected the plan and issued an ultimatum to Iraq the same day to begin large-scale withdrawal from Kuwait the next day. Saddam Hussein rejected the ultimatum. Also on the 22nd, Bush and Gorbachev spoke, ending the mediation efforts that proved to have only a marginal effect on crisis abatement.  The military intervention plan was set on 11 February. The combined land, air, and sea attack on Iraqi forces began early in the morning of 24 February. In four days the Iraqi forces were mauled--but not decimated--by the coalition's ground forces. On the 27th the U.S. declared a unilateral "suspension of offensive combat operations." Iraq accepted the informal cease-fire on the 28th. The terms for an interim cease-fire were codified and adopted by the UN Security Council on 2 March--Resolution 686. Iraq accepted on the 6th. The conditions for a long-term cease-fire were set down in Resolution 687, passed by the Council on 3 April. Iraq acquiesced on the 6th.  U.S. troops began to leave Iraq on 8 April. On the 9th the Security Council authorized the deployment of a peacekeeping force of 1,440 to patrol a demilitarized zone along the Iraq/Kuwait border. The beginning of the implementation of the formal cease-fire on 12 April 1991 marked the end of the Gulf War crisis.
Rwanda experienced an ethnic crisis with Uganda from 30 September 1990 to 29 March 1991. Ethnic conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi communities has been endemic in Rwanda (and neighboring Burundi) since long before independence in July 1962. Until a successful Hutu revolt in 1959 the Tutsi dominated politics and the military. Thousands of Rwanda Tutsi fled to nearby states, Burundi, the Congo (later, Zaire), Tanganyika (later, Tanzania), and, most important, Uganda. It was in Uganda that thousands of Tutsi refugees organized themselves into a disciplined armed force, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), with the goal of regaining power in Rwanda. (They ultimately did so, at the end of a lengthy civil war and in the aftermath of the 1994 Hutu-organized genocide against the members of the Tutsi community who had not fled Rwanda.) A crisis for Rwanda was triggered on 30 September 1990 by an RPF incursion from its bases in Uganda that threatened the Hutu-dominated regime of President Juvenal Habyarimana. Inconclusive clashes in the capital, Kigali, occurred on 4-5 October.  Rwanda's initial response was to arrest 3,000 members of the Tutsi community, eliciting expressions of concern from Belgium and the U.S. A cease-fire, brokered under the auspices of Belgium, took effect on the 24th but collapsed quickly. Fighting resumed near the Rwanda/Uganda border in late October and, after a lull, again on 12 December and on 4 and 23 January 1991--there were further incursions by the RPF from across the Uganda border.  On several occasions Rwanda accused the Uganda army of assisting the RPF, a charge that was always denied.  During the episodic fighting between Rwanda's army and the RPF over a period of six months, many efforts were made to resolve the crisis by diplomacy. A Belgian diplomatic initiative began as early as 15 October 1990 (see below). On 26 October a regional summit conference in Zaire agreed on the creation of a joint monitoring group to supervise a cease-fire. Another regional meeting was held in Kenya in February. Talks between the presidents of Rwanda and Uganda in Tanzania on 17 February 1991 led to an agreement for an immediate cease-fire. A regional conference two days later in Tanzania called on the OAU and the UN to assist the return of refugees to Rwanda.  There was renewed fighting on 9 March and several days thereafter. Finally, at the initiative of Zaire, a cease-fire was signed by Uganda's government and the RPF on 18 March and was formalized on 29 March. This marked the end of the crisis--but not of the deep-rooted Hutu-Tutsi ethnic conflict in Rwanda, which was to generate one of the cataclysmic acts of genocide in the twentieth century, the slaughter of up to a million Tutsi by Hutu armed forces and police in 1994.  Among external powers, Belgium, the former colonial power in Rwanda as administrator of the UN Trust Territory, and Zaire were the most highly involved states in this crisis. As noted, Belgium sought an end to the fighting as early as 15 October 1991, through a diplomatic initiative in cooperation with the OAU: Rwanda's president refused to negotiate with the RPF. Belgium also sought the creation of an African peacekeeping force and offered logistical and financial support. And it sent an elite battalion of 600 soldiers, along with arms and ammunition, to assist the Rwanda army. Zaire served as the principal mediator in the crisis, as it began holding talks, in conjunction with the OAU, between Rwanda and Uganda on 22 November 1990 in Goma, Zaire. The president of Zaire mediated multiple peace talks throughout the crisis period, in both Zaire and Tanzania, and, as a result, Zaire played a key role in arranging the March 1992 cease-fire. Zaire also dispatched 1,000 troops to assist the Rwanda army, in accordance with their mutual defense agreement. France sent 150 paratroopers to protect Europeans resident in Rwanda.  The UN, the U.S., and Russia were not involved.
Sierra Leone experienced a foreign policy crisis from 23 March to 31 October 1991. Sierra Leone's crisis was a direct spillover from Liberia's lengthy, complex civil war, which began in 1989. Several groups vied for power in a conflict that wrecked havoc in Africa's oldest independent state: President Samuel Doe, backed by Liberia's army; the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor; and a small rebel armed group controlled by Prince Yormie Johnson. After Doe's murder on 11 September 1990, the remnants of his forces came under the command of Nimely David, head of the presidential guard. Moreover, there was an interim government of Liberia headed by Amos Sawyer, an academic and lawyer, based in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone; and there also was the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), also based in Freetown and supported by Libya. A crisis for Sierra Leone was triggered on 23 March 1991 when 25 people were killed on its territory in a cross-border raid by Taylor's troops. Burkina Faso, which provided the NPFL with military and logistical assistance, was perceived as the source of threat to its territory by Sierra Leone's President, Joseph Saidu Momoh.  Sierra Leone responded at once by dispatching 2,000 troops to the border area; and on 31 March they occupied part of Lofa County in Liberia. Heavy fighting in April and May led to the killing of an estimated 3,000-5,000 Sierra Leone civilians and Liberian refugees by the NPFL--which denied any involvement. By mid-May NPFL forces had penetrated 150 kilometers into Sierra Leone's territory.  The first of four summit meetings held by ECOWAS, intended to terminate Liberia's civil war, were held on 30 June at Yammoussoukro in the Ivory Coast, attended by the leaders of Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Togo, but to no avail. By 7 September all Liberian rebel forces had been expelled from Sierra Leone's territory.  At the fourth summit meeting, held on 29-31 October 1991 in the Ivory Coast, an agreement was reached. The NPFL agreed to surrender the territory it controlled within Liberia to ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group), a creation of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), a regional organization that played a crucial role in abating the crisis (see below). All foreign forces in Sierra Leone were to withdraw immediately; and a buffer zone between Liberia and Sierra Leone was to be created. This (temporary) suspension of the civil war in Liberia marked the end of Sierra Leone's crisis. Thereafter, when civil strife resumed in Liberia, it did not spill over the Sierra Leone border. (Liberia's civil war began to wind down in November 1994.)  ECOWAS provided an important mediation role at the summit meetings. Mediators were able to keep the border dispute at the top of the agenda, and they not only served as intermediaries between the two crisis actors, but they also helped the negotiation process between the rebel groups within Liberia. The final plan that the ECOWAS mediators presented and which led to the termination of the crisis was one proposed by U.S. President Carter earlier.  Besides the mediation that led to crisis termination, ECOWAS was involved in additional ways. In August 1990 it sent a multinational force (ECOMOG) to Liberia, 4,000-5,000 troops, mostly Nigerians and, secondarily, Ghanaians, to impose a cease-fire. In November 1991 ECOMOG, now about 8,000, separated the warring factions in Liberia, thereby facilitating the elusive quest for a political solution. In short, the regional organization attempted mediation, contributed peacekeepers, and served as an observer force. Some west African states were involved in Liberia's civil war outside of ECOMOG: Burkina Faso, as noted; and the Ivory Coast and Togo, which provided passive support to the NPFL.  Superpower involvement in this crisis was minimal to nil. On 12 April 1991 Sierra Leone sought--but did not receive--U.S. military assistance. Washington's role was confined to a diplomatic effort to end the civil war: its Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman Cohen, brokered a truce on 22 September 1991. The USSR and the UN were completely uninvolved.  (The lengthy civil war in Liberia, with an estimated 150,000 killed since December 1989, appeared to be winding down in August-September 1995; following an ECOWAS-brokered peace accord, signed on 19 August by all the militias, a temporary coalition government of the contending factions was formed in Monrovia on 1 September. However, renewed factional strife and the flight of thousands of refugees at the end of 1995 and in early January 1996, and still another major eruption of violence in April-May 1996, leading to a descent into anarchy in Monrovia, revealed the fragility of the Liberia peace accord. In 2003, Liberia began transitioning to a power-sharing government after a rebel uprising and considerable pressure from the U.S. forced Charles Taylor to abdicate power and flee to Nigeria.)  (Sierra Leone, too, experienced internal turmoil from 1991 to 2001. After a series of peace agreements between the Sierra Leone government and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), with direct participation of UN and Nigerian peace keeping forces, successful disarmament of the RUF rebels was realized in early 2002.)
Ghana experienced a crisis with Togo from 11 April to 5 October 1991. The relations between these west African neighbors had been strained for more than 30 years. Opponents of various regimes in Togo had sought refuge in Ghana. A crisis for Ghana was triggered on 11 April 1991, when Togolese soldiers threatened to fire at demonstrators who had fled across the border to Ghana. Togo closed the border and increased its military presence there. Ghana's Foreign Minister, Obed Asamoah, criticized Togo's behavior as designed to create an international incident, to enable Togo to seek outside help to solve serious internal problems: Togo was then experiencing mounting street violence, strikes, and harsh repression of all dissent by its security forces.  To avert a serious spillover from Togo's domestic crisis, Ghana's defense forces were placed on alert, to intervene if the safety of Ghanaians in Lomé, Togo's nearby capital, came under threat. Several cross-border violent incidents occurred; but a major confrontation between the armed forces of the two states was avoided. The low-intensity crisis continued until 5 October, when Ghana and Togo agreed to reopen their frontier.
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Slovenia, and Croatia were embroiled in a grave crisis during the first phase of Yugoslavia's disintegration as a federal state, from 25 June 1991 to 3 January 1992. The three main ethnic constituents of twentieth-century Yugoslavia were the products of varied historical experience. For Serbia, it was Greek Orthodox Christianity and five centuries of Turkish (Muslim) rule: the Serbs suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Kossovo in 1389, when Serbia became a vassal state of the Turks; and it was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1459. Serbia reemerged as an independent state in 1878 as part of the peace settlement at the Congress of Berlin. Both the Slovenes and the Croats were predominantly Roman Catholic and fell within the cultural and political orbit of Central Europe, most recently as parts of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian empire from 1867 until its dissolution in 1918.  In the political vacuum created by World War I and the demise of the Dual Monarchy, the "South Slavs" united: on 4 December 1918 they proclaimed the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, with young King Peter of Serbia as its monarch and Prince Alexander as Regent. Alexander succeeded to the throne upon Peter's death in 1921 and ruled until he was assassinated in 1934 (see Case #46--Assassination of King Alexander). In 1929 he had proclaimed a dictatorship over the kingdom and renamed it Yugoslavia in a symbolic effort to eradicate the historic and ethnic divisions. Peter II served as king from 1934 to 1945, with power in the hands of Prince Paul as regent.  During World War II the Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans successfully resisted all German attempts to overrun Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944. Belgrade, the Serbian capital, was liberated by Soviet and Yugoslav forces in October 1944.  In November 1945 the Constituent Assembly, with a majority held by the Communist-dominated National Front, proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito was the dominant figure in Yugoslavia until his death in 1980. Thereafter the state was ruled by a collective presidency, with its chairperson rotating among the six republics of the federation--Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro, and Macedonia. By 1990 communism as an ideology and political system was in disrepute throughout Eastern Europe. Economic deterioration during the preceding decade accentuated the always latent ethnic conflicts, which exploded in 1991 into crisis and war. A wave of political and ethnic unrest erupted in the spring of 1991, with Croatia and Slovenia pressing to transform Yugoslavia into a confederation of independent states. These two republics organized their own armed forces and, during May and June, proceeded rapidly along the path to independence. Both held a referendum, which resulted in strong support for independence. And Slovenia began constructing border-crossing stations along the Croatian border.  The European Community (EC) and the U.S. announced that they would not recognize Croatia's and Slovenia's independence if this included secession from Yugoslavia. On 1 June the Yugoslav Prime Minister, Ante Markovic, condemned Croatia's and Slovenia's moves to secede and claimed they were illegal. On the 24th he asked Slovenia and Croatia not to declare their independence, warning that such a step could create economic and social catastrophe. Declarations of independence by Croatia and Slovenia on 25 June 1991 triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia (Serbia), for they threatened the continued existence of Yugoslavia as a federal state and Serbia's dominance. The federal government responded the same day by condemning the declarations as illegal; and the federal Prime Minister, Markovic, called on the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) to take control of Yugoslavia's international borders. JNA tanks began to move toward Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital. These acts by Serbia-dominated Yugoslavia triggered a crisis for Slovenia and Croatia.  Minor clashes began in Slovenia, becoming more intense on 26 and 27 June, as JNA troops used force to take control of several border posts from Slovenian authorities and deployed tanks and troops around Slovenia's airport. In Croatia, Serbs stormed a police station, killing three persons. While the President of the newly proclaimed Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, made efforts to restrain violence, Slovenia's Defense Minister, Jansa, announced on the 27th that "Slovenia is at war"; and the Slovenian President, Milan Kucan, called on Slovenians to defend their sovereignty against Serb "aggression."  An EC mission, comprising the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands, initiated the first cease-fire agreement in the Yugoslavia I crisis on 28 June; but the agreement broke down the next day, and minor clashes were renewed. The fighting escalated in Croatia during July; but it ended in Slovenia by 3 July and did not spread to the other republics. On the 2nd the Slovenian capital was heavily bombed by Yugoslavia's air force. After talks between Stjephan Mesic, the (Croat) President of the Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia, and Slovenian leaders that day, Slovenia agreed to release prisoners, and a cease-fire agreement was reached. On 3 July some JNA units began to withdraw from Slovenia. And on the 5th Slovenia announced that it had demobilized 10,000 soldiers in its defense force and began to lift blockades. Thus tension declined in Slovenia at the beginning of July.  A formal agreement, which was reached in talks between the EC mission and officials from Slovenia, Croatia, and the Federal Presidency on 7 July on the island of Brioni, marks the termination of Slovenia's crisis. Slovenia (and Croatia) agreed to suspend implementation of their independence, but not the declarations themselves. It was also agreed that, during a three-month cessation period, negotiations would begin on the future of all republics and provinces in the Yugoslav federation, and that hostilities would cease immediately. Further, the JNA would soon withdraw to its bases, and the Slovenian militia would be demobilized.  At an emergency meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) on 3-4 July in Prague a decision was made to dispatch an EC-based mission to Yugoslavia to supervise the cease-fire and to send a CSCE good offices mission to mediate among the parties. The EC foreign ministers decided on 5 July to impose an arms embargo and to freeze financial aid to Yugoslavia. A meeting of central European states on 26-27 July, including Yugoslavia and its neighbors (Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia), issued a statement supporting the EC proposals to end the violence in Yugoslavia.  A hint of things to come--enlargement of the Yugoslavia crisis--became evident in August: discussions by Serb and Croat officials, with a view to partitioning Bosnia-Hercegovina, threatened the republic; and Sarajevo approached the EC and Turkey for support. (The Bosnia crisis was to erupt in March 1992 [see Case #403--Yugoslavia II: Bosnia].)  In the meantime, Croatia's crisis intensified. On 22 August Croatia's President Tudjman warned that, unless Serbian "aggression" against Croatia ceased and the JNA withdrew from Croatia by the end of the month, "all necessary steps" would be taken to protect the new state. On 27 August a new cease-fire between Croatia's militia and the JNA was signed; but it was broken within hours. EC foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, held Serbia responsible for the conflict, as did U.S. officials on the 29th. The EC proposed an international peace conference to resolve the crisis.  An international peace conference on Yugoslavia opened in London on 7 September. An arbitration commission of lawyers from France, Italy, and Germany was appointed. The meeting was brief and did not mark a major change in the crisis.  During September the war in Yugoslavia escalated, and Croatia lost about one-third of its territory (Krajina) to Serb forces in Croatia. (Croatian forces recaptured Krajina in a two-day campaign in August 1995.) All six Yugoslav republics and the President of the collective State Presidency, Mesic, and the (Croat) Federal Prime Minister, Markovic, signed another cease-fire agreement in Belgrade on 2 September. The agreement was reached through mediation by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek. However, as often in the past and the future, the cease-fire broke down quickly, and heavy fighting in Croatia resumed. On 25 September, at France's initiative, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 713, calling for a complete arms embargo on Yugoslavia and requesting the UN Secretary-General to assist with mediation. It has been speculated that France brought in the UN because, as a member of the Security Council, it wished to gain greater leverage in the negotiation process vis-à-vis Germany, which was using its prominent position in the EC to insist on recognition of Slovenian and Croatian independence.  Fighting spread for the first time to Serbian territory in early November 1991 as Croatian forces attacked Serbian villages. The most serious clashes between Serbs and Croats began on 18 November in Vukovar, Croatia: 900 people were killed; and the Croats were forced to surrender to the Serb-dominated JNA. This battle weakened the Croats and led to the end of the crisis within six weeks.  On 8 November the EC Council of Ministers imposed trade sanctions on Yugoslavia; and on the 25th it suspended Yugoslavia's special status in the European Parliament. President Bush said in December that the U.S. would also impose trade sanctions against Yugoslavia.  The first cease-fire mediated by the UN was signed on 23 November. JNA forces began to withdraw from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the 28th. However, fighting resumed in December.  With Germany taking the lead, the EC agreed in principle to recognize the independence of the seceding Yugoslav republics; and on 9 December an EC peace conference stated that Yugoslavia was "legally in process of dissolution." On the 10th the EC lifted its sanctions on four of the Yugoslav republics, but not Serbia and Montenegro, which were accused of aggression.  On 19 December two Serb enclaves in Croatia--the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina, and the Serb Autonomous Region of Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem--declared themselves the Serbian Republic of Krajina. The two regions did not have a common border; but together they encompassed a third of Croatia's territory. Serbia recognized the republic the next day.  On 20 December the parties signed another cease-fire agreement, the 15th brokered by UN special envoy (and former U.S. Secretary of State) Cyrus Vance. Politically, it was a compromise for both parties: Croatia retained its demand for independence but lost about one-third of its territory to Serbia. The cease-fire took effect on 3 January 1992. It was the first to last and create some stability. As such, the implementation of this agreement terminated the crisis for both Croatia and Yugoslavia (Serbia).  The UN was highly involved in this crisis, as noted: the Security Council's Resolution 713; and successful mediation by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative-- notably the cease-fire agreement that brought the crisis to an end. U.S. activity was limited to several political statements. The USSR was not visibly involved. The EC and the CSCE, by contrast, were highly involved and NATO modestly so. As noted, the EC and the UN were very active in mediating the crisis, with the UN the most effective in achieving crisis termination.
Kuwait experienced a brief (2-3 day) crisis with Iraq starting on 28 August 1991. Following the Gulf crisis-war, there were several incidents between Kuwait and Iraq, notably on 15 August 1991 when Kuwait accused Iraq of violating the cease-fire in the Demilitarized Zone between the two states. On 28 August 1991 Kuwait accused Iraq of landing troops on the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan in order to retrieve weapons and military equipment abandoned by Iraq there during the Gulf War. This generated a perception of higher-than-normal threat to its territorial integrity, triggering a crisis for Kuwait.  It responded by protesting to the UN Security Council against "a clear violation of the [Gulf War] cease-fire agreement." Members of the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM) visited Bubiyan on the 29th to investigate the incident. The next day Kuwaiti planes and helicopters resumed their patrols over the island. The crisis, with very minor clashes, faded by the end of August.  The U.S. provided Kuwait with political support. The USSR remained aloof from this crisis, as did the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Zaire, along with Belgium and France, was enmeshed in a crisis arising from internal turmoil from 23 September to 4 November 1991. The former Belgian Congo became independent on 30 June 1960 and was almost immediately confronted with an international crisis triggered by a mutiny among its soldiers (see Case #176). The occupation of Stanleyville by rebel forces and the formation of a Revolutionary Council on 4 August 1964 led to another Congo crisis with high-profile foreign military intervention (see Case #211). In November 1965 Colonel Mobutu seized power in a coup d'état--and remains Head of State in Zaire (formerly Congo) 32 years later. As in 1960 and 1964 a crisis for Zaire, Belgium, and France was triggered by an internal challenge on 23 September 1991: the catalyst was rioting by regular troops of Zaire's army and their occupation of Kinshasa Airport, in protest against low wages. The Mobutu regime correctly perceived this as a serious threat to Zaire's political system. For France and Belgium, as for Belgium and other states in the two earlier crises in the Congo, turmoil in Zaire's army posed a threat to influence in this raw material-rich state, the largest in central Africa.  Belgium and France responded on the 24th by announcing their intention to dispatch troops to Zaire to protect and evacuate foreign (Western) residents.  The next day President Mobutu termed the riots in Kinshasa the worst since those that accompanied the coming of independence, in July 1960. Opposition parties, which protested against impending foreign intervention, proposed Etienne Tsisekedi as Premier of a "public salvation government" to cope with the riots. Mobutu acquiesced on 30 September, under pressure from the U.S., France, and Belgium. And on 3 October the newly appointed premier, in open opposition to the president's policy, asked France and Belgium not to withdraw their troops prematurely.  More clashes occurred in Kinshasa in mid-October. Tension between the president and premier escalated over the allocation of ministerial portfolios between Mobutu supporters and the opposition. Mobutu dismissed Tsisekedi on 20 October. The result of this act and the deteriorating economic situation was an eruption of violence in major cities of Zaire from 21 to 27 October. The evacuation of European residents from Zaire by Belgium and France was nearly complete by 25 October. And Belgium and France announced that they would withdraw shortly. France also announced the suspension of economic aid to Zaire. On the 27th Mobutu announced that he would remain in office, despite growing domestic and international pressure to resign. Four days later a group of opposition parties, the "Sacred Coalition," intensified its struggle with the president by forming a parallel regime in Kinshasa.  French troops departed on the 31st. Belgian troops followed on 4 November. This marked the end of Belgium's and Zaire's foreign policy crises and the international crisis as a whole, even though internal turmoil, violence, and political opposition to Mobutu continued for years.  The U.S. provided transport planes for the Belgian-French evacuation project. The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
Ecuador and Peru experienced another crisis over territory from 6 to 15 October 1991. The most recent flare-up in this protracted conflict over territory occurred near a Peruvian border post on the Corrientes River in January 1984. Tension between the two disputants rose in August 1991. On 30 September, at the UN, Ecuador's President Rodrigo Borja urged that Pope John Paul II be invited to mediate the dispute. (A South American precedent existed--a Vatican-mediated agreement between Argentina and Chile in 1984 that resolved their dispute since the mid-nineteenth century over the ownership of islands in the Beagle Channel [see Cases #287, #295--Beagle Channel I, II, in 1977-78, 1978-79, in Americas: Non-PCs].) On 2 October Peru's Defense Minister, General Torres, reaffirmed Lima's "trust" in the 1942 Rio Protocol, which had allocated the vast area in dispute to Peru. He also accused Ecuador of establishing a military post on Peruvian territory. The charge was rejected the next day by Ecuador's Defense Minister, Jorge Feliz, in a "we will not yield an inch" statement. This was echoed on the 5th by President Fujimori of Peru. A crisis for Ecuador was triggered by a perceived overflight of its territory on 6 October 1991 on the part of a Peruvian helicopter gunship. Ecuador responded the same day by suspending bilateral talks on the border then under way. This triggered a crisis for Peru. The threat of a serious military confrontation led the other three members of the five-state Andean Pact--Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela (along with Ecuador and Peru)--to urge a peaceful solution on the 8th. Ecuador accepted this initiative the next day, but Peru did not, calling, as always, for a solution "within the framework" of the 1942 Rio Protocol, that is, arbitration by its guarantors, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. Ecuador rejected the idea.  A meeting between the two foreign ministers on 10 October led to a statement, "we are on the right track." The crisis ended on 15 October, when the two sides withdrew their forces simultaneously from the border.  The UN and the USSR were not involved in this case.  (Another Ecuador/Peru crisis over the small, undemarcated part of their disputed border, approximately 130 square kilometers, occurred in late January and February 1995, with serious clashes and an estimated 80 soldiers killed and 200 wounded (see Case #413). A cease-fire was signed on 1 March; but the parties continued to resist pressure by the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol to negotiate the substantive issue in dispute. Further minor incidents occurred until the protracted conflict was finally resolved in 1998.
An international crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan, part of a lengthy, still-unresolved conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh (N-K), erupted on 27 November 1991 and began to fade in mid-August 1992. In the turmoil that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 (see Cases #1, #3--Russian Civil War I, II, in 1918-20, in Multiregional PCs: East/West), the southern regions of the czarist empire experienced a brief period of political independence: Georgia and Armenia declared their independence on 22 April 1918, Azerbaijan on 26 May 1918. By November 1920 the "Red" forces, freed by victory in the war against Poland (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC), triumphed over the "Whites" in the south. Soviet-style governments were established in Georgia and Armenia, on 25 February and 2 April 1921. On 12 March 1922 the three regions were integrated into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became part of the newly created USSR on 30 December of that year. In December 1936, under the terms of the "Stalin Constitution," each became an "independent" republic in the 11-member USSR. So they remained until the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991.  Despite its overwhelming Armenian Christian population, Nagornyy-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, was incorporated into the overwhelmingly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan in July 1921. Although it acquired the status of an Autonomous Oblast (District) in June 1923, this sowed the seeds of a bitter conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which erupted in the late 1980s.  It began with street protests in N-K in October 1987. An attempt by an N-K delegation in Moscow between November 1987 and February 1988 to secure the transfer of the enclave to Armenia failed. There were mass demonstrations in N-K's capital, Stepanakert, on 11 February 1988. A week later Gorbachev, as Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), termed the problem of nationalities "the most fundamental and most vital issue" for the USSR. On 20 February the N-K Soviet requested the transfer of the enclave to Armenia; this was rejected by the CPSU Central Committee two days later. And on 24 February Soviet troops were dispatched to the area of conflict.  Clashes, demonstrations, and pressure continued throughout 1988 and the first half of 1989. Among the most noteworthy occurrences in 1988 were the following: the Sumgait massacre on 29 February--32 killed and 197 injured in an anti-Armenian riot in a city near the Azeri capital, Baku; the reiterated demand of the N-K Regional Council (Soviet) on 12 March for a transfer of the disputed territory to Armenia; the replacement of the Communist Party leaders in Armenia and Azerbaijan on 21 May; Gorbachev's announcement on 28 June that the Soviet Union would not accept the Armenian demand; the first confrontation between troops and protesters in Armenia on 5 July, with one person killed, 36 injured; a unanimous vote of the N-K Regional Council on 12 July in favor of immediate secession from Azerbaijan; the proclamation of a state of emergency in N-K on 21 September; a mass demonstration and intervention by troops the next day; outbreaks of violence in Baku and two other cities in Azerbaijan on 22 November, causing the deaths of three soldiers and injuries to 126 civilians; a severe earthquake on 7 December that devastated northern Armenia; the arrest of most members of the pro-Armenian Karabakh committee on 10 December, leading to large-scale protests and clashes in Armenia's capital, Yerevan.  Direct rule over N-K was imposed by Moscow on 12 January 1989. And, as a measure of the cost of the escalating dispute, an official estimate of cumulative casualties on 7 February cited 87 civilians and four soldiers killed; more than 1,500 civilians, 115 soldiers, and 32 policemen injured. After a period of tranquility, Armenia proclaimed a union with N-K on 1 December 1989, an act against which Azerbaijan protested.  In the meantime the USSR was in the process of disintegration. Even before this was consummated, with the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on 21 December 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan attained their independence, on 23 and 30 August 1991, respectively. An agreement between them on 24 September to set their territorial dispute at rest proved to be stillborn. A crisis for Armenia was triggered on 27 November 1991 by Azerbaijan's abolition of the long-existing N-K Autonomous Oblast. When, in a referendum on 10 December, the population of N-K overwhelmingly voted for independence, a crisis was triggered for Azerbaijan. This choice was reaffirmed in elections in N-K on 28 December.  Rapid escalation of the crisis occurred: on 3 January 1992 Armenia's parliament supported the N-K demand for independence; Azerbaijan mobilized its armed forces; Armenia replied in kind; and military clashes occurred.  Several attempts at mediation followed in January-April 1992: by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) -- both Armenia and Azerbaijan had recently joined the CSCE – which sent a mission to N-K on 12 February; by U.S. Secretary of State Baker, who visited both protagonists in February; by the UN Security Council, which passed two resolutions calling for a cease-fire by the conflicting parties; by Russia, which held peace talks in Moscow on 20 February; and by Turkey, Iran, and Czechoslovakia--all for naught. And, although Armenia declared on 3 March that it had no territorial claims against Azerbaijan and that the dispute over N-K was Azerbaijan's "internal affair," confrontation and military hostilities continued.  A further escalation point was a massive, successful attack by Armenia against the important town of Shusha on 8 May. Turkey, a patron of Azerbaijan, threatened Armenia on the 13th that it would intervene militarily if Shusha and Lachin were not restored to Azerbaijan. Russia responded by signing an agreement with Armenia on 15 May pledging military aid if its security were threatened. On the 20th Turkey reassured Russia that it would not intervene with force.  Azerbaijan launched a counteroffensive on 12 June. Because of its military successes, Armenia suspended its participation in the CSCE-sponsored peace talks in Rome, with the involvement of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Turkey, and the U.S. On 8 July Armenia rejected any formal link between N-K and Azerbaijan. On the 27th Azerbaijan accused Armenia of undermining its sovereignty. The N-K parliament accused Azerbaijan on 13 August of aggression, declared a six-month emergency, and ordered general mobilization. Although a finite end to the N-K crisis is not discernible, it can be viewed as fading from mid-August 1992 onward. The conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh continues unresolved.  As noted, Russia was highly involved in this crisis. U.S. involvement was limited to its participation in the CSCE-sponsored Rome mediation effort. Many other states attempted to mediate the crisis and underlying conflict.
Egypt and Sudan experienced another crisis over a long-standing border dispute from late January to late June 1992. The Hala'ib region of southeast Egypt along the Red Sea has long been a source of contention. The 1899 agreement between Egypt and the U.K., which established an Anglo-Egyptian condominium over Sudan, determined that the border between Egypt and Sudan was to run along a straight west-east line. However, for convenience, Sudan was given authority to administer the Hala'ib area, almost 20,000 square kilometers, north of the line, and Egypt, an area south of the line. Over time Sudan began to claim political and economic rights in the Hala'ib area, for example, the right of its residents to vote in Sudanese elections, and the right to exploit its economic resources. However, Sudan never openly challenged Egypt's sovereignty over this area. Until Sudan's independence in 1956 the issue never became a focus of conflict; and thereafter Egypt allowed Sudan to administer the area.  Overt conflict was rare. However, on one occasion, in February 1958, Egypt and Sudan were embroiled in a crisis over Cairo's attempt to take control of the area by force. Although it remained non-violent, troops were dispatched, and Sudan complained to the UN Secretary-General about Egypt's "aggression" (see Case #163--Egypt/Sudan Border I). A crisis for Egypt was triggered toward the end of January 1992 when Sudan granted a Canadian oil company a concession to explore for oil in Hala'ib. Egypt contested this right early in February by advising oil companies around the world that Sudan did not have the authority to sign exploration agreements on any land north of their political boundary as laid down in the 1899 condominium agreement. However, it expressed the hope to settle the dispute quietly and did not issue an official protest. Sudan, by contrast, argued that "administrative" rights included the right to utilize the area's potential economic resources.  This low-intensity crisis escalated on 4 April when armed clashes occurred between Egyptian and Sudanese forces in the disputed area. President Mubarak sent an apology to Sudan's ruler, General Hassan a-Bashir. Two joint commissions were created--to examine the clash and to seek a resolution of the dispute. They met from 22 April to 5 May, without result. Other attempts were made to settle the disagreement through quiet diplomacy; but they too were unsuccessful.  The crisis ended as a result of the external actor's behavior: the Canadian company stopped its exploration in the Hala'ib region at the end of June, thereby removing the object of contention.  There was no involvement by the U.S., Russia, the UN, the OAU, or the Arab League.  (Tension declined but did not entirely dissipate after the termination of oil exploration. In August 1992 Egypt placed all mosques in the Hala'ib region under its control. Roads were constructed to give Egypt readier access to the region. And in mid-December Egyptian troop reinforcements were reportedly dispatched to the area. In December, too, Sudan sent a memo to the UN Security Council explaining its position on the dispute; but it did not seek UN intervention. And in mid-December Egypt's foreign minister declared that any dispute with Sudan could be resolved peacefully.)  (In June 1995 the Hala'ib dispute was reactivated--in the aftermath of an attempted assassination of Mubarak upon his arrival in Addis Ababa for an OAU summit. Egypt's president explicitly charged Sudan with collusion in this act and called upon the Sudanese people to overthrow its fundamentalist Islamic government. Several soldiers on both sides were reportedly wounded and, according to Sudan, two policemen killed, in a border clash in the Hala'ib region on 27 June 1995. But this episode, too, faded without serious consequences. The dispute remains unresolved.)
Yugoslavia (Serbia), Bosnia, and Croatia (and powerful minorities, notably the Bosnian Serbs) were entangled in a lengthy crisis over the fate of Bosnia-Hercegovina as a political entity. It began on 3 March 1992 and ended on 21 November 1995. The people of Bosnia-Hercegovina are, ethnically, part of the community of "South Slavs," including Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, and Montenegrins. By the end of the tenth century the people of eastern Bosnia, like those of modern Serbia, had accepted eastern Orthodox Christianity, while those of western Bosnia, like the Croats and Slovenes, had embraced Roman Catholicism.  The historical background, too, is complex. Bosnians and Serbs fought side by side in the decisive Battle of Kossovo in 1389; and like Serbia, Bosnia became part of the Ottoman Empire. There was one notable difference, with consequences for the crises of the 1990s. During the five centuries of Turkish rule the religious composition of Bosnia changed drastically, partly because of the immigration of Turks, partly because of the conversion of many Bosnians to Islam. The result was that, at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution, Muslims formed the largest religious-ethnic community in Bosnia, slightly more than half, compared to 31 percent for the Orthodox Serbs and 17 percent for the Catholic Croats.  Austria was given the right to occupy--but not to annex--Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1878, at the same time the major powers granted Serbia independence: Serbia's long-standing aspiration to control these two areas was rebuffed. More significantly, Bosnia and Hercegovina were annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in October 1908, generating undisguised anger in Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. That association lasted only a decade: with the dissolution of the Dual Empire at the end of World War I, Bosnia and Hercegovina became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, created in 1918. And after World War II they became, together, one of the six constituent republics of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY). In the post-Tito era, from 1980 to 1991, Bosnia-Hercegovina shared in the governance of Yugoslavia as a member of the collective and rotating Federal Presidency.  Bosnia-Hercegovina (hereafter, Bosnia) was not involved in the first stage of Yugoslavia's prolonged crisis-war from June 1991 to early January 1992 (see Case #397--Yugoslavia I: Croatia, Slovenia); it remained a constituent republic of the Yugoslav federation. However, the reality of dissolution and the assertion of independence by two of Yugoslavia's republics penetrated Bosnia's political culture: a favorable attitude toward an independent Bosnia was already evident, especially among the Muslims, in 1991-92. Bosnia's Muslims and Croats voted strongly in favor of independence on 2 March 1992 and requested recognition by the European Union (EU) and its members (the European Community [EC] was renamed the European Union [EU] in February 1992, when the Maastricht Treaty came into effect). The Bosnian Serbs boycotted the referendum and warned of grave consequences. The next day Bosnia declared its independence. That act triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia, dominated more than ever by Serbia, and enraged the Bosnian Serbs. Fighting broke out at once between Bosnian Muslims and Croats on one side, the Yugoslav National Army (the JNA) and Bosnian Serbs on the other.  On 18 March, Bosnian Serb, Croat, and Muslim leaders signed an agreement in Lisbon to transform Bosnia-Hercegovina into three ethnic regions or cantons within a formally united independent state. However, on his return to Sarajevo, the (Muslim) President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, called on Bosnians to reject the division. He accused the governments of Serbia and Croatia of encouraging extreme Serb and Croat forces in Bosnia with the aim of partitioning Bosnia between them.  Largely at the urging of Germany, EU members recognized Bosnia's independence on 6 April. The U.S. did so on the 7th, recognizing Croatia and Slovenia as well. Other states recognized Bosnia's independence soon after, including Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia. In response to the EU's recognition, ethnic Serbs declared a Serbian Republic of Bosnia the same day; and Yugoslav planes attacked Croatian towns in western Bosnia, triggering a crisis for Croatia. Fighting worsened on 14 April, as Serbian forces tried to create a corridor from Krajina, a Serb enclave in western Croatia, to Serbia itself. Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was subjected to an artillery barrage on 21 April, the first of hundreds of such attacks during the next three years. In fact, the pattern of behavior by all the crisis actors and the key involved actors--the major powers, the EU, the UN, Bosnian Serbs, and Bosnian Croats--during the prolonged second Yugoslavia crisis was established in the early days, as follows.  Bosnia--the use of force and diplomacy, and appeals to world public opinion, to maintain its existence as an independent state  Yugoslavia (Serbia)--support to the Bosnian Serbs, both military equipment and economic aid, to assist them in achieving their shared goal of "Greater Serbia" by any means, including "ethnic cleansing," that is, incorporating as much of Bosnia's territory as possible into Serbia, with as few non-Serb inhabitants as necessary; this behavior was moderated occasionally in order to satisfy pressure from the West, including the EU and NATO, and the UN, and to ease the burden of economic sanctions on Serbia proper  Croatia--the least consistent of all the actors, shifting alignments with different goals, sometimes with Serbia, with the aim of eliminating Bosnia and partitioning its territory between them, at other times with Bosnia, designed to weaken the Bosnian Serbs and to compel them to disgorge a substantial part of the 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia acquired by force of arms and "ethnic cleansing"  Bosnian Serbs--primary reliance on force and the policy of "ethnic cleansing" to take irrevocable control of most of Bosnia's territory for the Serb Republic of Bosnia, to realize the ultimate goal of Greater Serbia, supplemented by diplomacy, including political concessions to the UN or the EU when necessary, in order to prevent military intervention by the major powers or the lifting of the arms embargo, which adversely affected the Bosnian army much more than the Bosnian Serbs' military capability  Bosnian Croats--the use of force and "nuisance" tactics, to assert control over territory with a large Croat population, to be integrated into Croatia, and to undermine efforts at military and political cooperation between Bosnia and Croatia  The UN--moderating the fighting in Bosnia through its United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peacekeepers; reducing the suffering of civilians by designating exposed cities like Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, "safe areas," and by as large and steady a supply of food and medicine to Bosnia's civilians as the Bosnian Serbs permitted; and seeking a peaceful solution of the conflict through economic sanctions--against the rump of Yugoslavia--and diplomacy, notably comprehensive peace plans by special representatives of the Secretary-General  NATO--providing limited military support for UNPROFOR peacekeepers when necessary, through symbolic air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, and verbal threats of retaliation  The EU--reliance on diplomacy, complementing that of the UN, to bring the parties to the bargaining table, exercised through an EU mediator, endless visits by foreign ministers of major European powers and others to all the actors, and cooperation with the U.S. and Russia through the "Contact Group," comprising the five major powers  (Since this pattern of behavior is evident throughout the Yugoslavia II crisis, the rest of this case summary will concentrate on escalation points and crucial developments.)  On 28 April 1992 the UN decided to extend its peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) to Bosnia-Hercegovina.  On 22 May Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia were admitted to the UN. On the 30th the Security Council adopted Resolution 757, imposing comprehensive sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), comprising Serbia and Montenegro. These included the severance of sports, cultural, and air links with the rest of the world; freezing government assets abroad, and an oil embargo. On 20 June Bosnia declared a state of war and general mobilization--five days after Bosnian President Izetbegovic and Croatian President Tudjman signed an agreement of friendship and cooperation, including military cooperation, "against the common enemy." As the war continued Bosnia's government repeatedly requested foreign military aid--but the embargo on arms remains in force. The U.S. Congress favored lifting the embargo; the EU, notably the U.K. and France, was steadfastly opposed.  As violence continued, amid horrific reports in the summer of 1992 of grave human rights violations, the UN Security Council and the UN Human Rights Commission strongly condemned the policy of forced deportation. Under the impact of intense media coverage of Bosnian Serb "ethnic cleansing," France, the U.K., Italy, Spain, and Belgium committed troops to a UN peacekeeping force.  Representatives of 20 states, including the six former republics of Yugoslavia, EU members, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and members of the CSCE met in London on 26-27 August 1992. The first of several futile efforts at "public crisis management," the conference condemned the expulsion of civilians. It also agreed on terms for a political settlement, including recognition of Bosnia by the other five Yugoslav republics, acceptance of present frontiers, guarantees for national minorities, and the right of return for those who were expelled from their homes. And it supported the idea of a UN peacekeeping force.  A follow-up "permanent" conference on Yugoslavia in Geneva began on 3 September. Following the Iraq precedent (see Case #406--Iraq No-Fly Zone, in Iraq/Kuwait PC), a UN Security Council resolution on 9 October 1992 banned military flights over Bosnia, to be enforced by UNPROFOR. Notwithstanding Croatia's military cooperation agreement with Bosnia, Croat forces in Bosnia took control of Mostar on 25 October and declared it the capital of the Croatian Community of Herceg-Bosnia.  In a seemingly endless quest for a viable diplomatic formula, the Geneva Conference, on 20 October, formally rejected the division of Bosnia into three ethnic republics. Instead it presented a plan for a decentralized republic, based on several regional governments and a central government in Sarajevo, responsible for foreign policy, defense, and trade.  Early in January 1993 the two principal mediators, Lord Owen (for the EU) and Cyrus Vance (for the UN), presented a comprehensive and complex three-part peace plan to the Geneva Conference on Yugoslavia: territorial provisions, calling for the reorganization of Bosnia into 10 provinces, with an attached map; constitutional principles, providing much autonomy to the provinces; and a military section, including a cease-fire and demilitarization. The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, rejected the proposals, demanding the right of the Serbs to self-determination in a separate "state within a state." Bosnia's President Izetbegovic rejected the territorial section of the plan. And the Bosnian Croat leader, Boban, accepted the plan in full. Under strong pressure from Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, the Bosnian Serb Assembly voted in favor of the principles of the plan on 19-20 January. All three parties tried to increase their control over territory before a peace agreement was signed. Thus fighting escalated in the second half of January.  President Izetbegovic of Bosnia formally approved the military provisions of the Vance-Owen plan on 2 February and the all-important territorial section on the 25th. Only the Bosnian Serbs were adamant: on 25-26 April the Bosnian Serb Assembly rejected the proposed map. The FRY Foreign Minister, Vladislav Jovanovic, was sent to persuade the Serbs to accept the plan, in vain. The Bosnian Serbs were universally condemned. However, a cease-fire was accepted by all sides on 27 March 1993, allowing a relief convoy to enter Srebrenica.  On 27 April President Yeltsin warned the Bosnian Serbs that Russia would not protect them as long as they rejected the Vance-Owen plan. Croatia was warned by Western states in May that sanctions against Serbia would be lifted if it continued to support the Bosnian Croat forces. Meanwhile, Serb attacks continued against Bosnian Muslim areas.  The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 824 on 6 May 1993, declaring Sarajevo and five other towns "safe-areas," banning any armed attacks on them: Gorazde, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Zepa in the east, Bihac in the north. On 4 June the Security Council adopted Resolution 836, authorizing UNPROFOR to use force in cases of attacks against the six "safe areas" in Bosnia.  Typical of Croat maneuvering between the other two warring parties was an agreement by Presidents Milosevic (Serbia) and Tudjman (Croatia), announced to the Geneva Conference on 26 June 1993, to divide Bosnia into three ethnic states within a loose confederal Union of Republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Izetbegovic rejected the plan; but on 30 July he indicated acceptance, with reservations. Bosnian Muslims renewed their rejection of the Vance-Owen map at the end of August. And in September and October 1993 the Bosnian Assembly, the Bosnian Croat Assembly, and the Bosnian Serb Parliament all rejected the plan to partition Bosnia into three republics.  The impasse on the Vance-Owen peace plan continued. So too did the fighting, including the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo and frequent attacks on "safe areas"; the impotence of UNPROFOR, based upon the extreme caution of all the major powers; their consensus against military intervention to end the fighting in Bosnia; U.S. verbal support of Bosnia; Russian attempts to shield Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs from more extreme UN-EU-NATO measures; the U.S.-EU disagreement on the arms embargo; UN resolutions, usually ignored; and cease-fire agreements, another in August 1993, violated sooner rather than later by one side or another. The plan for a "Union of Three Republics" was discussed at another international conference on Bosnia in Geneva at the end of November-early December 1993. Efforts were made to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to give up part of the land they controlled (approximately 70 percent of Bosnia's territory), in order to increase the size of the Muslim republic to about one-third of Bosnia's territory, mostly in central Bosnia, with several enclaves in the east. In return, the EC offered to lift the sanctions against Serbia gradually. Karadzic offered some territory--in exchange for the partition of Sarajevo into two cities, to be incorporated into the planned Muslim and Serb republics. Izetbegovic had two major concerns: the security of the new borders, for which he demanded a five-year NATO guarantee; and an outlet to the Adriatic Sea, at the port of Neum. In the absence of assurances on both points, he rejected the plan on 21 December.  One of the most shocking assaults on civilians occurred on 5 February 1994: a mortar bomb hit the main market of Sarajevo and killed dozens of civilians.  Outraged Western leaders called for "the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo by all means necessary, including air power." The response was swift. On the 9th NATO declared that it would execute immediately any future UN request for air strikes in Bosnia. Moreover, NATO ambassadors gave the Bosnian Serbs an ultimatum: withdraw or hand over to UN control all heavy weapons in the "safe areas" by midnight, 20-21 February, or face air strikes.  The large-scale withdrawal of Serb heavy weapons began on 17 February, following an unexpected Russian intervention--an offer to replace the withdrawing Serb soldiers with 800 Russian troops; the first 400 Russians reached Sarajevo on the 20th. And on 28 February NATO aircraft first enforced the "no-fly zone" over Bosnia, shooting down four Soko G-4 aircraft.  Another shift in Croatia's zigzag policy and the convoluted diplomacy of the Bosnia crisis occurred on 8 March: agreements were signed in Washington to create a federation of Muslim- and Croat-controlled territory in Bosnia, to be divided into cantons on the Swiss model, and to form in the near future a Bosnia-Croatia confederation. A constitution for the Bosnia federation and plans for a unified Croat-Muslim army in Bosnia were approved at simultaneous conferences in Vienna and Split from 4-8 March. While the federation and confederation formally came into existence, none of these agreements altered the course of the crisis. The Bosnian Serb Assembly, invited to join the Bosnia federation, declined on 24 March. A cease-fire agreement in June 1994 between the new Bosnian Federation of Muslims and Croats, and the Bosnian Serbs, lasted a month.  Among the major powers there were profound disagreements on policy toward Bosnia. Both the U.S. and Russia steadfastly refused to contribute any ground forces to UNPROFOR; but they differed substantially on many issues. The U.S. favored lifting the arms embargo, in order to "level the fighting field" between Bosnia and the Bosnian Serbs. It urged the adoption of a policy of "preventive bombardment" of Serb positions (which the U.K. and France, as well as Russia, opposed). The U.S. argued that sanctions against Serbia should be tightened and that the no-fly zone should be enforced by a Security Council resolution. Russia, traditionally pro-Serb, supported the Vance-Owen peace plan and the international peacekeeping force. However, it opposed the imposition of more sanctions against Serbia.  The West, too, was split over policy toward the Bosnia crisis. The U.S. was the most militant--verbally; the Europeans were cautious in word and deed. The U.S. Congress persistently urged the lifting of the UN arms embargo (and voted in favor of a unilateral U.S. termination of the embargo in July 1995).  However, both presidents--Bush and Clinton--while favoring the policy, refused to act in direct conflict with the U.K. and France, NATO and the EU, especially since they bore the brunt of the peacekeeping operation on the ground, with thousands of troops, while the U.S. refused to participate in UNPROFOR. The Europeans, except for Germany, claimed that lifting the arms embargo would enlarge the scope and intensity of the war, with unpredictable and, almost certainly, dire consequences.  The U.S. was also much more activist on the issue of NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, designed to increase pressure on them to desist from more "ethnic cleansing," blocking food shipments to UN "safe areas," and attacks on UN peacekeepers. The air strikes almost always had momentary--or negative--results. (On one occasion, in June 1995, the Bosnian Serbs retaliated by taking several hundred UNPROFOR hostages in response to a U.S.-initiated NATO air strike.)  (In August 1995, the Yugoslavia II crisis escalated dramatically when the Croatian army, in a lightning three-day campaign, regained control of Krajina, the Serb majority area of Croatia, bordering on Serbia and Bosnia. Yugoslavia [Serbia] did not intervene, despite the forced exodus ["ethnic cleansing"] by Croatia of 150,000 Serb refugees to Serbia proper.)  (Another major escalation of the crisis-war over Bosnia was the Bosnian Serb capture of two UN "safe areas," Srebrenica and Zepa, on 11 and 25 July, followed by the massing of Bosnian Serb forces near Gorazde; the tightening of the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo; and on 28 August, a shelling of a crowded market in the capital with 37 killed and 80 wounded, recalling a similar incident in February 1994, when 68 people were killed and more than 200 wounded. The effect of these escalation points was the first direct NATO military intervention, in the form of massive air attacks against Bosnian Serb positions at the beginning of September. That, in turn, was the catalyst to a renewed, intense, diplomatic process, leading to an agreed "Statement of  Basic Principles" by the three warring parties on 8 September and a 21-day conference (1-21 November) at Dayton, Ohio, among the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia under U.S. auspices.)  The Dayton Accord, signed by all the parties including the now fully involved United States, on 21 November 1995, was a complex agreement with the following main provisions: (1) a division of territory between the Bosnian-Croat Federation (51 percent) and the autonomous Serb entity, the republic of Srpska (49 percent); (2) a constitution comprising a central government for Bosnia as a whole with a three-person group presidency, a two-house legislature, a court, and a central bank; and separate presidencies, legislatures, and armies for each of the two entities within Bosnia; (3) the mutual withdrawal of forces by both entities behind agreed cease-fire lines; and (4) the dispatch of a peacekeeping NATO force of 60,000 under U.S. command to monitor the cease-fire and control the airspace over Bosnia. Despite strong Bosnian Serb opposition "on the ground"--President Milosevic of Serbia negotiated on their behalf--the Dayton Accord marked the end of Bosnia's crisis--on 21 November 1995.  (The formal peace agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December by the presidents of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia, and Serbia, in the symbolically important presence of the leaders of the Contact Group--France, Germany, Russia, the U.K., the U.S.--and Spain's Premier, then head of the European Union. Almost immediately after, the UN Security Council terminated the peacekeeping role of its UNPROFOR and authorized the dispatch of a NATO force of 60,000 troops to implement the withdrawal provisions of the Dayton Accord and to maintain peace in Bosnia.  All of the military provisions, including withdrawal of troops, were implemented in 1996, meeting the stipulated deadlines. The record on the civilian aspects of the Dayton Accord was mixed; but the elections for the central government of Bosnia-Hercegovina and its two constituent autonomous units were held, as planned, on 14 September 1996.)
These two island-states in the South Pacific experienced a crisis from 12 March until mid-September 1992. The root of this crisis was an ongoing secessionist conflict between Bougainville Island and Papua New Guinea (PNG) since the late 1980s. The rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) had compelled PNG forces to withdraw from their island in March 1990; but Bougainville's declaration of independence did not achieve international recognition. Negotiations between PNG and the BRA led to an accord in January 1991 to lift the crippling blockade of the island. In April 1991 PNG troops again landed on Bougainville leading to further clashes. Renewed fighting occurred in November 1991. A PNG offer of greater autonomy was rejected by the BRA, which relied on support from the Solomon Islands, an independent member of the Commonwealth since 1978. Internal strife in PNG acquired an interstate dimension with a PNG commando raid on the Solomon Islands on 12 March 1992, repeated on the 17th: it was designed to destroy a fuel storage depot that PNG believed was used to supply the Bougainville Revolutionary Army's campaign for independence. (This PNG perception was based upon racial and cultural affinity of the people of Bougainville and the Solomons and the geographic proximity of the two islands.)  Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni responded with a strong diplomatic protest. The PNG Prime Minister, Rabbie Namaliu, initially denied responsibility for the raid but later apologized for the "regrettable incident" to the Solomon Islands leader. At the same time, he renewed charges of military assistance to the BRA by the Solomons regime.  Another PNG commando raid on the Solomons occurred on 12 September. Once more the Solomons lodged a strong diplomatic protest and demanded an apology and compensation. They also deployed additional troops to the Shortland Islands. Several days later the PNG prime minister deplored the raid as "an atrocious act" and promised to punish those responsible, as well as to pay compensation to the Solomons. This terminated the crisis for both parties.  (There was a modest third-party intervention: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, along with the Solomon Islands, formed a multinational supervisory team to interrupt the Papua New Guinea blockade of Bougainville.)  One consequence of the crisis was a report on 24 September that the Solomons had requested assistance from Japan and Taiwan to construct a military base in the area. Both remained aloof. So too did the UN, the U.S., and the USSR.
Thailand and Myanmar (formerly, Burma) experienced a crisis from 14 March to 25 December 1992 over the latter's cross-border "hot pursuit" raids. Since its attainment of independence from British rule on 4 January 1948, Burma's government and many minority communities (Karens, Kachins, etc.) were engaged in a prolonged military struggle for control of the borderlands of the new state. (That internal conflict remained unabated in 1995, though Burma's army imposed compliance on several minority groups in 1994 and 1995.) An international crisis for Thailand was triggered on 14 March 1992 when Myanmar forces, pursuing rebels near the border with Thailand, occupied the strategic Sleeping Dog Hill in Thai territory near Manerplaw. Thai forces were urged to withdraw from the area in order to avoid air and artillery attacks.  Thailand responded to a perceived threat to territory by placing its air force on alert and moving troops to the border. A fierce battle occurred on the 17th. The next day Thailand's interior minister warned Myanmar's military regime of the danger of continued occupation of Thai territory. And another inconclusive battle occurred the same day.  After an extended lull, a group of 10 Thai officials was arrested on 6 October while trying to reclaim Myanmar-occupied Thai villages. They were released on the 13th. In an extraordinary act on 4 December, Thai King Bhumibol called on both sides to settle the border dispute peacefully. The result was a meeting of military delegations from the two states a few days later. On 25 December Myanmar troops withdrew from Sleeping Dog Hill, terminating this crisis between two Southeast Asian neighbors.  The UN, the U.S., and Russia were not involved in this crisis.
Iraq experienced a post-Gulf War crisis from 18 August to 8 September 1992 over the "no-fly zone" imposed by the U.S., the U.K., and France. Notwithstanding its military defeat in January-February 1991 (see Case #393--Gulf War), Iraq's regime continued a long-standing policy of repression against its Kurdish minority in the north and the Shia in the south. The victors in the war, led by the U.S., created "safe havens" for the Kurds in April 1991, following their failed rebellion against Saddam Hussein's regime and the mass flight--estimated at almost two million refugees--into the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. That Western interventionist regime in northern Iraq was still in force, in a modified form, six years after the war.  The idea of a no-fly zone south of the 32nd Parallel emerged from reports in early August 1992 of increasing Iraqi military activity and violations of human rights among the Shia population in southern Iraq.  On 11 August, at a UN Security Council meeting convened at the request of France, the U.K., and the U.S., the UN rapporteur on human rights in Iraq reported that there was documentary evidence of a systematic policy by Iraq to destroy the Shia Arabs of the marshlands and their culture. The Council did not pass a resolution; but this meeting was perceived--by Iraq, the Western powers, and others--as a step toward enforcing Iraq's compliance with the provision of Security Council Resolution 688, passed at the end of the Gulf War, demanding that Iraq's regime cease suppressing its Kurdish and Shia minorities. On 12 August Iraq dismissed Mr. van der Stoel's report as "inaccurate." On 18 August 1992 senior officials from France, the U.K., and the U.S. announced that they had decided to impose an "air exclusion zone" over Iraq. This was followed by a U.K. announcement of the dispatch of six Tornado jets to take part in an allied operation to protect the population of southern Iraq. These two announcements triggered a crisis for Iraq, which perceived a threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity. On 20 August France announced that it would send 10 Mirage-2000 jets to the region. The U.S. already had more than 200 planes in the area.  Iraq's initial response, on the 20th, was to denounce the Western plan for an exclusive zone--an "imperialist conspiracy" aimed at dismembering Iraq. The same day Egypt expressed concern for the sovereignty and integrity of Iraq's territory. Turkey, too, announced that it opposed any plan "directed against the integrity of Iraq." And on 23 August official statements from Algeria, Jordan, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and the Arab League expressed concern about the integrity of Iraq, warning that the plan would increase tension in the region.  On 26 August U.S. President Bush officially announced the establishment of the exclusion zone by France, Russia, the U.K., and the U.S., in order to protect the Shia population of southern Iraq. The decision imposed an immediate ban on flights by Iraqi helicopters and aircraft south of the 32nd Parallel.  Iraq was officially notified about the decision through its Permanent Representative at the UN, Abdul Amir al-Anbari.  Al-Anbari responded by denouncing the decision as an "illegal act" that required "clear and firm" Arab opposition and warned that "Iraq will choose the proper way and the proper time to confront this outrageous aggression." Algeria, Jordan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen condemned the decision as a dangerous precedent in the region and as an indicator of the West's intention of partitioning Iraq into three blocks--Kurdish in the north, Sunni in the center, and Shia in the south. Egypt and Sa'udi Arabia, the leading Arab allies in the U.S.-led, anti-Iraq coalition of 1990-91, expressed reservations. Only Kuwait publicly approved the plan.  In late August, with the no-fly zone in effect, Iraq increased its ground campaign against Shia rebels in the south. However, Baghdad showed tacit compliance with the decision: it ordered its air force to keep away from the exclusion zone and instructed its ground forces not to fire at Western aircraft.  The major powers who initiated the no-fly zone strengthened their military power in the area. France sent another four Mirage jets. And Russia, throughout the 1990 crisis and war the most empathetic toward Iraq, announced on 1 September that it would send two warships to the Gulf.  On 5 September King Hassan of Morocco issued a strong warning against the West's "dangerous policy" toward Iraq. Foreign ministers from the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), dominated by Sa'udia Arabia, met in Jiddah on 8-9 September and accepted the enforcement of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.  On 8 September Iraq's government reassured U.S., British, and French pilots monitoring the 'air exclusion zone' that they had nothing to fear if forced to land on Iraqi territory because of mechanical problems.  The crisis for Iraq seemed to end on 8 September with Iraq's compliance and statements that reduced tension among the confronting parties.  (Four years later a fresh crisis--between Iraq and the United States--erupted over both no-fly zones. Iraqi troops and armor entered the Kurdish safe haven in September 1996, in support of one of the two factions vying for power in Iraqi Kurdistan for decades, the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The U.S., viewing this incursion as a violation of the safe haven--and a threat to its vital interests in the Gulf region, responded with two missile attacks against Iraqi air defenses in the southern no-fly zone; direct military intervention in the north was not politically feasible. After a symbolic Iraqi retaliation against a U.S. plane flying a reconnaissance mission in the south, both adversaries refrained from further escalation of the 1996 Iraq no-fly zone crisis.)
The newly independent state of Georgia experienced a crisis with Russia from 25 September 1992 to 8 October 1993 during its prolonged civil war against a separatist movement in Abkhazia. The origins of Georgia can be traced to the first millennium b.c.e. However, its modern history began in 1800 when, in response to an appeal by the last king of Georgia for support against Persia, it was annexed by Russia. It was ruled until the end of World War I as an outlying province of the empire.  The collapse of czarist Russia and the turmoil accompanying the Bolshevik Revolution provided Georgia--and its Caucasian neighbors, Armenia and Azerbaijan--a "window of opportunity." The result was a short-lived independence, from April 1918 to February 1921, until the armies of the new Bolshevik regime established control over Transcaucasia. In March 1922 Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan were merged into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic (TSSR) and became a part of the USSR. In 1936, under the "Stalin Constitution," they became "independent" republics of the Soviet Union. With the dissolution of the USSR at the end of 1991, Georgia, along with Armenia and Azerbaijan, became an independent state.  Abkhazia was an autonomous province in the northern part of Georgia near the border with the post-Soviet Russian Republic. The democratically elected first president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a Georgian nationalist, was forced into exile in January 1992 by a rebellion led by former communists. Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Foreign Minister--and a former colonel in the KGB--became president.  Abkhazians, a distinctive ethnic group within Georgia, live mainly in the autonomous republics of Abkhazia and Adzarya, in which the port cities of Sukhumi and Batumi, Georgia's largest Black Sea harbors, are located. Abkhazian leaders demanded secession--the anti-Georgia movement in Abkhazia began its campaign against Georgia as early as 1977 but was suppressed by Soviet power. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Georgia as a sovereign state, the long-standing low-intensity conflict within Georgia burst into a full-scale civil war, in which Russia supported the Abkhazians.  Fighting began in August 1992 between Georgian troops and Abkhaz separatists. Gamsakhurdia saw the eruption of war as an opportunity to return to power. The civil war threatened to draw Russia into conflict with Georgia, which accused Russia of actively supporting the rebels in order to protect its interests in the North Caucasus and the Black Sea region in general. Russia had a clear and stated goal of maintaining a strategic presence along Georgia's Black Sea coast, that is, a conception of Russia's "rights" in its neighboring "new states" as similar to those encompassed in the Brezhnev Doctrine (see Case #227--Prague Spring, in 1968, in Europe: Non-PCs). To Russia's nationalists and military, who were thought to be behind the Russian involvement in Georgia's civil strife, the secession of Abkhazia was viewed as both an opportunity to regain access to Black Sea resorts and "revenge" for Shevardnadze's role in the dissolution of the USSR. On 25 September 1992 Russia's Supreme Soviet (later, Duma) denounced Georgia's resort to violence in the interethnic conflict with the separatists of Abkhazia. It also passed a resolution suspending the delivery of Russian arms and equipment to Georgia. This triggered a crisis for Georgia, reinforcing its image of Russia as the patron of the Abkhaz separatists. Georgia accused Russia of interference in its domestic affairs.  After a lull in the fighting, serious clashes between Georgia's forces and the Abkhazian rebels resumed on 2 October. President Shevardnadze of Georgia blamed Russia for supplying arms to the separatists. Russia denied any involvement. But the next day President Boris Yeltsin warned that Russia would take "appropriate measures" if the lives of Russians in the conflict areas were threatened.  Relations with Russia worsened when the Georgian State Council announced that Georgia would take control of all Russian weapons and military equipment on its territory. The Russian Defense Minister, Marshal Pavel Grachev, warned that such an act would lead to "armed clashes." Georgia actually seized a Russian arms depot in southern Georgia on 2 November; and Marshal Grachev warned that Russia was prepared to use force in order to regain control of the depot.  Tension between Tbilisi and Moscow increased when, on 6 November, Georgia accused Russia of bombing Georgian positions in Sukhumi, the Abkhaz capital, and on the 8th, when Russia accused Georgia of involvement in the murder of three Russian soldiers in Abkhazia. In December 1992, after a Russian helicopter was shot down--it was delivering humanitarian aid to an Abkhazian town--Russia issued a protest and Defense Minister Grachev threatened again to take "measures of a military nature."  The Georgian Prime Minister, Tengiz Signa, said on 17 December that there was a crisis in relations between Georgia and Russia, but not a state of war. Georgia's parliament demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Abkhazia: despite the Russian denials of involvement in the civil war, 46 Russian servicemen had been killed in Georgia in 1992.  On 5 January 1993, Shevardnadze asked UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali to deploy a UN peacekeeping force to Abkhazia. Shevardnadze also urged the UN to call on Georgia's neighbors to remain neutral in the conflict. The next day a UN spokesperson said that time for UN intervention was not yet ripe. However, a UN mission arrived in Tbilisi on 20 January to ascertain the need for emergency aid for victims of ethnic conflict in the republic.  While fighting between Georgian forces and separatists continued, talks between Russia and Georgia were resumed in Tbilisi in January, with the goal of signing a friendship and cooperation accord between the two countries and to discuss the status of Russian troops in Georgia.  A major attack by separatists on Sukhumi, then held by Georgian forces, on 14-17 March, was materially aided by Russia. Georgia's parliament declared that the attack proved that Russia was escalating its undeclared war against Georgia. Russia again denied any involvement in the conflict. Yet, the bilateral talks continued, and a trade agreement was reached in March.  In April, Eduard Brunner was appointed by the UN Secretary-General as his Special Representative to assist in efforts to solve the Abkhazia conflict. Shevardnadze called for more active involvement by international organizations.  Violence continued in Georgia throughout June. On 16-22 June the Russian foreign minister held talks in Moscow with Georgian and Abkhaz delegations, in search of a cease-fire. As violence continued, Kozyrev threatened that "all necessary measures" would be taken against those responsible.  Georgian Prime Minister Tengiz Segna demanded on 7 July that Russia end its undeclared war against Georgia and called for the severance of diplomatic relations with Russia; the call was rejected by Shevardnadze.  Finally, on 27 July 1993 a peace agreement, mediated by Russia, was signed by Georgia and the Abkhaz separatists. Russia agreed to send troops as neutral peacekeepers, and the parties agreed on the need for UN observers to monitor the cease-fire. This agreement led to a sharp decline in tension between Georgia and Russia.  Shevardnadze and Yeltsin met in August and said that they were satisfied with the first steps toward a final settlement of the conflict over the future of Abkhazia.  On 25 August the UN Security Council approved the proposal to send 88 military observers to Georgia. The next day Georgia's army reported that all of its heavy military equipment and some troops had been withdrawn from the front line, as agreed in July. However, a surprise attack was launched on 16 September by Abkhaz separatists, and Sukhumi fell to the rebels after the major withdrawal of Georgian forces. On the 27th Shevardnadze accused Russia of "betrayal" and, specifically, of refusal to honor its obligations under the July cease-fire agreement, to enforce peace by military force if necessary.  In a letter to the UN Secretary-General, Shevardnadze wrote: "the world community should become aware that the evil empire is still thriving, still sowing seeds of death." Russia imposed sanctions on Abkhazia on 19-20 September but rejected Shevardnadze's call for the imposition of peace by the threat of force.  On 8 October, after a meeting with Yeltsin, Shevardnadze said that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was "the last chance to save the country" and agreed to join the loose successor to the USSR. (Georgia formally became a member of the CIS on 22 October.) Tension was defused, and the crisis ended.  (A peacekeeping force of 500 Russian marines arrived in Georgia on 4 November and was sent to western Georgia to protect main roads and railway lines. On 18 November the leader of Abkhazia's separatists, Vladislav Ardzinba, said that a referendum would be held to decide on unification with Russia.)  (The Georgia-Abkhaz agreement, mediated by the UN, was signed on 1 December in Geneva. The two sides agreed on a cease-fire and pledged to continue negotiations. They also agreed on the deployment of more international observers.)
North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were enmeshed in a post-Cold War crisis over nuclear proliferation from early March 1993 until 21 October 1994. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) formally came into effect in 1970. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) became a signatory in December 1985, part of the price for Soviet assistance in realizing its nuclear reactor program. As such, it undertook not to engage in activities that could lead to the production of nuclear weapons.  Further commitments were undertaken--by both Koreas--in their 1992 Denuclearization Agreement, notably a ban on the production of fissile material and the signing of a Joint Declaration on Denuclearization, an agreement in principle to establish a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. More tangibly, in the January 1992 IAEA Safeguards Agreement, the DPRK undertook to reveal the existence of 13 hitherto-unknown nuclear facilities and to permit regular inspections of North Korea's Yongbyon complex by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Notwithstanding these commitments, evidence of an incipient North Korean nuclear bomb program was reported by U.S. intelligence as early as February 1992.  Tension between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea was endemic: the former, acting as the NPT's monitoring body, kept pressing for total access to the latter's nuclear facilities, while North Korea attempted to restrict access.  In February 1993 IAEA inspectors, on a routine check, discovered a substantive discrepancy between the amount of weapons-grade plutonium and the amount reported by North Korea to the IAEA. This created the setting for an impending crisis. In early March 1993 the IAEA sought permission from the DPRK for a "special inspection" of two suspect, that is, hitherto-undeclared, nuclear waste sites. This triggered a crisis for North Korea, which perceived a threat to the "crown jewel" of its national security. It refused the request, claiming that these were restricted military nonnuclear facilities.  More ominously for the DPRK's adversaries, the ROK and its patron, the U.S., North Korea responded by giving public notice on 12 March of its intention to withdraw from the NPT regime. The reasons cited were the IAEA's unprecedented pressure to conduct special inspections and the impending annual "Team Spirit" military cooperation exercise by ROK and U.S. forces. Pyongyang's announcement, raising the specter of a full-scale, unmonitored North Korean nuclear weapons program, triggered a crisis for South Korea and the U.S.  South Korea's leaders had perceived a threat of renewed war with the DPRK since the Korean Armistice in 1953. The declaration from Pyongyang sharply accentuated Seoul's perception of the high likelihood of war, initiated by the North's larger and more powerful armed forces. For the U.S., the crisis threatened its primacy in the post-Cold War world order and, specifically, constituted a potentially dangerous precedent of nuclear proliferation by a small, ambitious state. The next day, 13 March, the IAEA called upon North Korea to reconsider its announcement.  Further escalation occurred in May-June. On 14 May the DPRK reportedly began removing nuclear fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor--without the presence of IAEA inspectors. On 10 June the IAEA's Board of Governors adopted a sanctions resolution, suspending technical assistance to Pyongyang. North Korea responded on the 13th by formally withdrawing from the IAEA. And on 14 June the U.S. called for an international coalition against North Korea's nuclear program, to be implemented through UN-authorized economic sanctions.  In a context of acutely rising tension the DPRK and the U.S. held two rounds of talks in June-July 1993. The first, 2-11 June in New York, achieved a "suspension" of the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT. At the second, 14-19 July in Geneva, the DPRK made a proposal that turned out to be the core of their ultimate accord--a replacement of its more dangerous graphite-moderated nuclear reactors with light-water nuclear reactors. After a lengthy period of deadlock they reached an interim agreement on 25 February 1994: the U.S. and the ROK would not hold the Team Spirit military exercise that year; and North Korea would allow a resumption of IAEA inspections.  The crisis escalated once more on 14 March 1994 when IAEA inspectors reported the discovery of additional discrepancies in the DPRK's nuclear program; but Pyongyang denied them permission to take samples for further examination. This led to a suspension of bilateral U.S./DPRK talks. On 31 March the UN Secretary-General called on Pyongyang to allow IAEA inspectors to complete their investigation.  On 15 April South Korea made a concession--giving up its demand for North/South Korea talks before additional North Korea/U.S. meetings. The North reciprocated on the 19th by inviting IAEA inspectors to be present when nuclear fuel rods were removed from one of its reactors. On 19 May these inspectors reported that there was no evidence of misuse of the extracted nuclear fuel.  On 16 June, at the invitation of North Korea's ruler, Kim Il-Sung, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang as a "private" mediator. Although Carter had met with U.S. President Clinton’s advisors prior to the visit, he declared that he would act independently of Washington. During the mediation visit, Carter specified the intentions of the U.S. and offered compromises that North Korea might make without losing face. Carter returned to Seoul on the 18th and delivered a message from Kim Il Sung to South Korean President Kim Young Sam that reciprocated the desire to have a bilateral meeting. Carter also brought news that North Korea had agreed not to expel IAEA inspectors and to freeze its nuclear program if the U.S. would allow North Korea to develop light-water nuclear reactors, agree to a third round of U.S.-DPRK talks and make a promise not to use nuclear weapons against North Korea. Carter's statement on 19 June that the crisis was over turned out to be premature; but it provided both a cooling-off period and a necessary face-saver for the adversaries.  Intense North Korea/U.S. negotiations took place very briefly in July 1994. They were interrupted on 8 July by the death of Kim Il-Sung but were resumed from 5 to 12 August and from 20 September to 17 October 1994. The outcome was a four-page "Agreed Framework" and a separate secret document signed on 21 October. The terms revealed a carefully calibrated schedule of mutual concessions.  The DPRK pledged to freeze its nuclear activities within a month and to store, that is, not reprocess, its 8,000 spent fuel rods. Once it received two replacement reactors, by the year 2003, it undertook to dispose of--abroad--its inventory of spent nuclear fuel, the sine qua non of a weapons program. It also promised not to refuel its existing five-megawatt reactor and not to complete the construction of two large reactors, one of 50 megawatts, the other of 200 megawatts, which the IAEA and the U.S. feared could generate enough weapons-grade plutonium to produce several--some estimates were as high as 30--nuclear bombs each year. In sum, the DPRK renounced any ambition to become a nuclear power, a goal that it constantly denied during the negotiations.  In return, the U.S. agreed to arrange for an "international consortium" to build two new light-water "proliferation-resistant" nuclear reactors, with a generating capacity of 2,000 megawatts, by the year 2003. These would provide North Korea with ample nuclear energy, with much less risk of extracting plutonium for a weapons program. The reactors were to be financed almost entirely by South Korea and Japan, the two most directly concerned states, and would be built in South Korea. In the interim, as compensation for the DPRK's freezing of its nuclear program, the U.S. would provide, at no cost to the DPRK, all of its heavy oil requirements for heating and electricity until the new reactors were installed: this would reach 500,000 metric tons annually by 1996. Finally, North Korea would not be obliged to open for inspection the two suspect nuclear facilities until a "significant portion" of the light-water project was completed, that is, for five years. The quid pro quo was that the DPRK would not receive the nuclear components to start its light-water reactors until it allowed all nuclear inspections sought by the IAEA. In sum, North Korea achieved almost all of its goals, through a comprehensive security, political, and economic package, but it yielded on its nuclear weapons program, a very high value. The U.S. seemed to have succeeded in aborting a nuclear weapons program by what it perceived as a rogue state.  Throughout the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula South Korea assumed a very low profile: it did so largely because of U.S. pressure not to compel the DPRK to lose face by negotiating directly with its mortal enemy, whose legitimacy it denied. In this sense the ROK was an observer of the very-high-stakes nuclear poker game between its patron and its feared foe. However, Seoul made known to Washington, frequently, its dissatisfaction with aspects of agreements reached in the bilateral talks.  In June 1993 President Kim Young Sam publicly cautioned the U.S. against acquiescing in the DPRK's efforts to shut the ROK out from any role in implementing an agreement. He also pressed for holding the Team Spirit military exercise in 1994, a point on which the U.S. conceded to the DPRK. He urged the U.S. to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK, which the U.S. did in January 1994. And he successfully pressed the U.S., through former President Carter, to arrange a meeting with Kim Il-Sung. Only the sudden death of North Korea's leader in July 1994 prevented the realization of a North/South Korea dialogue. Most important, South Korea made known its dissatisfaction with the vagueness surrounding its intended role in the implementation of the 21 October 1994 agreement, especially since it was to bear the overwhelming financial burden, $4 billion. And this spilled over to public criticism of the U.S. by the ROK's president on 7 October 1994 for its "naive and overly flexible" negotiations with a regime on the verge of collapse. In this respect, South Korea ultimately achieved its primary goal during the crisis (see below).  The October 1994 agreement terminated the North Korea Nuclear Crisis--but not the conflict over the DPRK's suspected aspirations to join the nuclear weapons club.  (For eight months after the agreement its implementation foundered on the extremely sensitive issue of who would construct, supply, and install the two light-water nuclear reactors. The U.S. contended that the only possible source was South Korea, especially since it had agreed to bear most of the $4 billion cost, and that North Korean negotiators had accepted this provision. DPRK negotiators denied this contention and adamantly refused to accept reactors from its archenemy, the ROK. The obstacle was overcome through a bilateral agreement reached in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 12 June 1995: North Korea accepted South Korea's primary role in building, supplying, and installing the two new reactors. The U.S. provided a fig leaf to its adversary: everything to do with the two new reactors was to be implemented through the newly created (9 March 1995) Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization [KPEDO], comprising South Korea, the U.S., and Japan. The implementation process was set in motion by a supplementary supply contract agreement between North Korea and the KPEDO on 15 December 1995, which included "compensation" to the former for dismantling its nuclear reactors.)  Russia played no role in this crisis. China, the DPRK's sole major power ally, offered important political support, notably a threat to veto any UN Security Council economic sanctions resolution; for the rest it was passive throughout. Japan perceived a threat from North Korea's nuclear program along with time pressure. But unlike with South Korea, the crucial "high probability of war" condition was not visible. Japan was highly involved but not a direct crisis actor. It offered financial assistance in the construction of the two new reactors. At the same time, along with China and South Korea, it urged Washington not to impose economic sanctions, which North Korea had repeatedly declared it would treat as an "act of war." The UN was involved indirectly, through its specialized agency, the IAEA.  (Concerns for North Korea’s nuclear problem led to another crisis that began in late 2002, after North Korea admitted to the U.S. that it was pursuing the development of nuclear weapons and announced in January 2003 that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This latest crisis is yet to be resolved as the U.S. and other powers in Asia have attempted a number of diplomatic and economic incentives to curtail the willingness of North Korea to pursue the development of nuclear weapons.)
Israel and Lebanon were embroiled in a crisis from 10 to 31 July 1993. Low-intensity violence has been the norm in Israel/Lebanon relations since the failed "Litani Operation" by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in March 1978. During its 1982 "Peace for Galilee" campaign, that is, the Lebanon War, Israel created a "security zone" in south Lebanon to protect its northern towns and settlements from frequent shelling by hostile forces, notably from several factions within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) or the Iranian-backed Hizbullah ("Party of God"). These raids intensified during the Intifada (the Uprising) by Palestinians against Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from December 1987 until the signing of the Israel/PLO Oslo Accord in August 1993. There were frequent raids and retaliations across the Israel/Lebanon border--by both sides. One of these escalated to a full-scale crisis in 1993. A crisis for Israel was triggered on 10 July by a Hizbullah attack in the security zone that killed five IDF soldiers and wounded many others. Israel's initial response was a public demand by Prime Minister Rabin the same day that Syria curb the activities of the Hizbullah, whose headquarters were located in the Biqa Valley of Lebanon, where Syria held sway. Simultaneously Israel deployed more troops and firepower to its border with Lebanon.  On 19 July, after another Hizbullah attack in which several Israeli soldiers were wounded, the IDF was authorized to take whatever steps were necessary to protect the northern border. Rabin, who also held the Defense portfolio, issued another warning to both Syria and the Hizbullah. Another Israeli soldier was killed on the 23rd. Two days later came Israel's major response, the launching of "Operation Accountability." Heavy air raids and intense artillery attacks on south Lebanon villages, as well as Hizbullah bases all over Lebanon, triggered a crisis for Lebanon.  The aim of Israel's massive retaliation was to catalyze a flight of large numbers of people in south Lebanon to Beirut in an attempt to compel the government of Lebanon to stop Hizbullah's attacks on Israeli soldiers in the security zone and Israeli civilians in towns and villages near the northern border. Operation Accountability was dramatically successful at one level--half a million Lebanese refugees fled north to the capital. But even this was at a high cost in terms of external images of Israel: their flight was vividly portrayed by TV cameras for tens of millions of viewers around the world. As for the aim of curbing the Hizbullah via pressure from Lebanon, this was politically unrealistic: since the beginning of its civil war in 1975, and even after that war ended in 1991, Lebanon was incapable of protecting its territory or people from any invader, Israel or Syria, PLO or Hizbullah; it had become a client state, totally dependent on Syria.  UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali publicly condemned Israel on 28 July for creating a massive refugee problem. The government of Lebanon complained to the UN Security Council on the 30th, its major response to the crisis. The Council passed a resolution critical of Israel and called for its withdrawal from all Lebanese territory. On the 31st a cease-fire between the IDF and Hizbullah was arranged through U.S. mediation: the IDF agreed to desist from military operations north of the security zone, that is, against villages in south Lebanon; and Hizbullah pledged to stop firing missiles into northern Israel. Thus ended the crisis over Operation Accountability. However, tension and low-intensity violence continued intermittently in the Israel/Lebanon border area.  The U.S. criticized the scope of Operation Accountability and its humanitarian costs. More importantly, the U.S. contributed to crisis abatement by serving as a mediator between Syria and Israel, applying diplomatic pressure, and, as noted above, brokering a cease-fire. Russia remained aloof.  (There was an exact replay of Operation Accountability in April 1996. Hizbullah fired Katyusha rockets into towns and villages of northern Israel, triggering a crisis for Israel. The IDF's massive response, "Operation Grapes of Wrath," catalyzed a large-scale migration from south to north Lebanon, triggering a crisis for Lebanon. Once more, the U.S. brokered an agreement, restoring the "rules of the game," namely, no military acts against civilians in the border area.)  (Israel withdrew its forces from Lebanon in May 2000.)
Nigeria and Cameroon were embroiled in another crisis over territory from the end of December 1993 until late November 1994. The borderland area of Bakassi consists largely of Nigerian nationals, mostly fishers. However, Nigeria had no legal claim to the territory. An Anglo-German treaty in 1913 had assigned the territory to the then-British colony of Southern Cameroon. And in the postindependence period Nigeria acknowledged Cameroon's sovereignty in the 1975 Maroua treaty. A crisis for Nigeria was triggered at the end of December 1993 when Cameroonian troops raided the fishing village of Abana, killing six persons. Nigeria responded on 3 January by occupying Diamond and Djsbana, Cameroonian islands in an oil-producing sector of the Gulf of Guinea. That act catalyzed a crisis for Cameroon, which, in turn, responded by dispatching troops in an attempt to reassert its claim to the islands.  From that initial tit-for-tat exchange the crisis oscillated between expressions of conciliation and minor clashes. Thus, on 6 January 1994, Cameroon's President, Paul Biya, and Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Baba Gana Kingibe, met in a friendly atmosphere and decided to establish joint patrols in the disputed area. On 17 February there were renewed clashes. Ten days later a French military mission arrived in Cameroon under the terms of their 1974 defense agreement. Nigeria reacted angrily, its foreign minister attacking France on 2 March for internationalizing the dispute.  Crisis diplomacy intensified in March. Cameroon submitted the dispute to the International Court of Justice and requested both the UN Security Council and the OAU to mediate. It also accepted a mediation offer by Togo. The foreign ministers of Nigeria and Cameroon met on 9-10 March. Peaceful crisis management suffered a setback when Cameroon's president made the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the islands a condition for a summit meeting.  The OAU became active on 24 March when it passed a resolution calling on both parties to do the following: withdraw their troops from the disputed area; exercise restraint; take measures to restore confidence; and continue their negotiations. Neither party was pleased with this package. Again in mid-April the OAU offered to mediate by dispatching a delegation to the two capitals. Their task was aggravated by the apparent use of the Bakassi dispute by both heads of state to enhance domestic support for their authoritarian rule.  There was progress at a summit meeting between Biya and the head of Nigeria's military regime, General Abacha, in Tunis on 13 June: they agreed to set up a joint committee with a Togolese chairman to seek a peaceful solution. A commitment to finding a lasting solution to their territorial dispute was reaffirmed at a joint meeting on 4-6 July. However, a summit meeting scheduled for 18 July was postponed. And on 18 September 10 Cameroonian soldiers were killed in a surprise attack by Nigerian troops.  Thereafter the crisis de-escalated--and faded in late November. This is evident in expressions of "delight" at the maintenance of peace despite the continuing territorial dispute, at a meeting between Nigeria's president and foreign minister with Cameroon's ambassador on 6 December 1994. The dispute remains unresolved; but the 1993-94 crisis faded into a mutual acceptance of the status quo.  Neither the U.S. nor Russia was involved in the crisis. The UN did not respond to attempts by Cameroon to draw it into the dispute. Only the OAU, as noted, was active in crisis management.  (Despite the long-standing de facto cease-fire in the dispute over Bakassi, violence flared up again in late April 1996.)
The United States and Haiti were embroiled in a crisis from mid-July to 15 October 1994. For most of its history Haiti was ruled by a foreign power. It was a colony of Spain from the earliest days of European contact with the Americas at the end of the fifteenth century. It was ceded to France in 1697 and remained a French colony until a successful slave revolt and victory over a large French army sent by Napoleon, leading to independence in 1804.  After a century of Haiti's isolation, the U.S. became the hegemonial power. It began with the landing of marines in 1915 and an imposed treaty that made Haiti a political and financial protectorate of the United States, initially for 10 years and then extended to 1936. Thereafter Haiti was ruled by despots, notably the Duvaliers, father and son, from 1957 to 1990.  In the first democratic elections, held on 16 December 1990, Father Jean Bertrand Aristide, a left-wing Roman Catholic priest, was elected President. However, less than a year later (30 September 1991) he was ousted by a military junta headed by Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras. All attempts to restore Aristide to power failed, including an agreement to step down, brokered by the U.S. and signed by the junta on 3 July 1993 (Governors Island Agreement).  From 1991 to 1994 Haiti was characterized by brutal repression and violation of human rights, including the killing of 3,000 civilians by paramilitary "death squads." In desperation, Haitians sought refuge in the U.S.--on a massive scale: in one eight-day period, 1-9 July 1994, an estimated 12,300 "boat people" were rescued and sent to makeshift camps in Panama and then to the U.S. naval base in Cuba, Guantanamo Bay. It was this dramatic upsurge of refugees that triggered a crisis for the U.S.: the potential--and likely--flood of Haitian boat people was perceived by the Clinton administration as a threat to domestic stability at a time when the U.S. was still in the grip of economic recession. This concern was accentuated by the image of U.S. impotence in the face of a military junta in the poorest and weakest state in the Americas resisting all efforts by the hegemonial power to restore democracy to the island. These themes were central to Clinton's announcement on 15 September 1994 of impending U.S. intervention (see below).  A major escalation point in the crisis was UN Security Council Resolution 940, passed on 31 July 1994 by 12-0, with two abstentions (Brazil and China) and one member absent (Rwanda): it authorized member-states "to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership." The phrase, "all necessary means," was identical to the wording of the Security Council's authorizing resolution in the Gulf crisis of 1990 (see Case #393--Gulf War, in Middle East: Non-PCs). As in 1990, too, it was designed to legitimize U.S. military intervention, in this case to oust the junta from power in Haiti. (In both crises it served that purpose.) Resolution 940 also reaffirmed all nine earlier Council resolutions on Haiti, six in 1993, three in 1994, again following the precedent of the Council's Resolution 678 on 29 November 1990 during the Gulf crisis.  During the next six weeks attention shifted to the U.S. Congress and to public opinion: both seemed hostile or indifferent to military intervention, especially in light of the emergent fiasco of the U.S.'s humanitarian intervention in Somalia.  (Before the intervention only 31 percent of the public approved sending troops to Haiti; and even after its success only 41 percent approved.) Fearful of taking a grave political risk and hoping to forge a consensus, the Clinton administration attempted one more type of peaceful crisis management, namely, an "unofficial" mediation effort by three high-profile Americans, former President Carter, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell, and Senator Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Their mission to Haiti on 16 September led to an agreement with the junta two days later, which provided the framework for non-violent crisis resolution. The three members of the junta, Cedras, his chief of staff, Brigadier-General Philippe Blamby, and Colonel Michel François, the chief of police, were to step down and leave Haiti. President Aristide was to be restored to power. And UN economic sanctions on Haiti, including a crippling trade embargo, were to be lifted.  What made the agreement possible was a strong public statement by Clinton on 15 September: in an address to the nation the president announced the decision to intervene militarily, linking it to the Monroe and Truman Doctrines. It was, he said, designed "to protect U.S. interests," which were specified as putting an end to the atrocities on the island, "to secure our borders and preserve stability in our hemisphere, and to promote democracy and uphold the reliability of our commitment around the world." He also announced the Carter mediation mission as a willingness "to go the final mile" in an effort to resolve the crisis without violence. He was unequivocal that the mission was not going to negotiate with the junta but merely to settle the modalities for their departure from power and from Haiti.  The Clinton announcement of an imminent invasion triggered a crisis for Haiti, that is, the military junta. Only then did it perceive U.S. resolve to compel their abdication from power and their departure from Haiti. Their response was to accept these terms in the negotiations with the Carter mission from 16-18 September.  With the Carter-brokered agreement in hand, 20,000 U.S. troops landed in Haiti in the following week, with a mandate to remain up to six months, if necessary. They rapidly took control of the island, with virtually no opposition and minuscule violence. Cedras resigned as commander in chief of Haiti's armed forces on 10 October. Three days later he and Blamby left for Panama; François had already fled to the Dominican Republic. Finally, with much fanfare, Aristide returned to the island and the president's palace on 15 October, marking the end of the Haiti Military Regime crisis.
Kuwait, Sa'udi Arabia, the United States, and Iraq were enmeshed in another Gulf crisis from 7 October to 10 November 1994. During the years that followed the Gulf War the U.S., the U.K., Kuwait, and Sa'udi Arabia were steadfast in their determination to maintain the sanctions regime until Iraq had fully complied with all UN demands as set out in the 7 March 1991 resolution, including an explicit demand that Iraq recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia and France adopted a softer line, calling for the gradual lifting of sanctions, primarily because they perceived major economic benefits from Iraq's return to the international community.  In late September 1994 President Saddam Hussein had to stop subsidizing food prices. This caused a large price increase that led to internal unrest in Iraq. Baghdad renewed its demand that UN sanctions be lifted on humanitarian grounds--Iraqi children were suffering the ill effects of malnutrition, and the population at large was experiencing the adverse effects of a persistent shortage of medicines and general medical services. Hussein warned that Iraq would retaliate if the Security Council, at its next scheduled meeting on 10 October, decided to renew economic sanctions, especially the oil embargo. In this atmosphere of escalating tension, very similar to the prelude to the 1990-91 Gulf crisis-war, Iraqi forces began to move toward Kuwait on 2 October. On the 4th Saddam Hussein condemned the U.S. insistence on retaining the sanctions, which continued to cripple the Iraqi economy. Iraq's deployment of troops near its border with Kuwait on 7 October 1994, estimated at 40,000-50,000, triggered a crisis for Kuwait and Sa'udi Arabia: it threatened their territorial integrity and rekindled memories of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Iraq's massive military buildup in a few days also triggered a crisis for the U.S., a renewed threat to its influence and economic (oil) interests in the region. (Since the Gulf War the U.S. has been committed to protect the Gulf states from Iraqi attacks.)  The gravity of the threat perceived by the U.S. was evident in several statements and actions on the 7th: "the most threatening moves Iraq had taken since the Gulf War," according to unnamed U.S. officials; Iraq's moves "are not routine … and therefore cause us concern," said Defense Secretary Perry; and President Clinton expressed his resolve not to permit Baghdad to threaten the UN into lifting sanctions.  Among the "precautionary" steps, Clinton ordered the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, to the Red Sea, along with the Aegis cruiser equipped with Tomahawk missiles. The U.S. also sent 4,000 troops to Kuwait the same day. These military moves triggered a crisis for Iraq. There were other visible expressions of U.S. resolve. At a meeting with the Sa'udi Foreign Minister, Sa'ud al-Faisal, on the 7th, Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Sa'udi Arabia's security. In a telephone call Secretary of State Christopher reassured Kuwait's foreign minister of U.S. support and its readiness to respond firmly to Iraq's "aggression." On 8 October Clinton, wanting to avoid President Bush's mixed signals of U.S. intent in 1990, warned Saddam Hussein in unmistakable words: "It would be a grave error for Iraq to repeat the mistakes of the past or to misjudge either American will or American power." The next day Clinton announced the dispatch of 36,000 more troops and planes to the Persian Gulf. On the 10th Iraq announced that its forces would be withdrawn from the Kuwaiti border.  In telephone calls on the 10th Clinton spoke with the leaders of the U.K., France, Russia, Egypt, and Turkey, seeking support for military action against Iraq, if necessary. The six leaders reportedly expressed support for "quick and vigorous military measures to defend Kuwait" and agreed to oppose Iraq's attempt to press the UN to lift the economic sanctions.  On 11 October Iraq began to withdraw forces from the Kuwaiti border. Nevertheless, the U.S. announced the same day the deployment of more troops and planes to the region and placed 155,000 ground troops on alert. A major U.S. concern was the danger that Iraq would indulge in similar threats in the future and create further international crises. Defense Secretary Perry emphasized that the U.S. did not want to maintain substantial forces in Kuwait for a long time.  The display of rapid U.S. resolve elicited gratitude from the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (Sa'udi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates): at a meeting with Christopher on the 12th their foreign ministers affirmed a commitment to pay the cost of deploying U.S. forces to the Gulf to defend Kuwait. The Gulf states also undertook to send their "Peninsula Shield Force" to help defend Kuwait.  Kuwait sought international support for a buffer zone in southern Iraq and called on the UN to press Iraq for information on the 600+ Kuwaiti hostages taken to Iraq during the 1990 invasion. The U.K. and France sent modest, symbolic forces to the region: the former, 900 troops, ships, and warplanes, the latter, a warship. King Hussein of Jordan, in contrast to 1991, condemned Iraq's provocation on 11 October. He did not deploy troops; but he expressed support for the possible use of military force by the U.S. and its allies to punish Saddam Hussein.  Among the many involved actors Russia was the most active on the diplomatic front. During a visit of Foreign Minister Kozyrev to Baghdad, Iraq and Russia announced an agreement on 13 October: Iraq would recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and borders; and this act would be linked to the lifting of some of the international sanctions within six months. The U.S. and U.K. responded the same day that there would be no negotiations with Iraq on terms for lifting the sanctions. To the contrary: U.S. officials, viewing Iraq as a long-term threat, spoke of requesting the UN to create a demilitarized zone in southern Iraq, from which Iraqi forces would be excluded.  On 15 October President Yeltsin wrote to Clinton, conveying his support for the Kozyrev-initiated idea of Iraq's recognition of Kuwait in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Clinton replied with an expression of concern, since this was a sharp shift in Russia's long-standing support of the U.S. position of no negotiations on sanctions until after Iraq demonstrated full compliance with all UN resolutions.  The Security Council unanimously approved a U.S.-U.K.-initiated resolution on 10 October condemning Iraq's new threat to the Gulf region. It also demanded that Iraq withdraw immediately all its forces deployed in southern Iraq and avoid using force and aggressive acts to threaten its neighbors in the future, or to disturb UN activity in Iraq. Russia voted for the resolution, despite differences about how to deal with the Iraqi threat.  On 17 October Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council informed its National Assembly of the intention to recognize Kuwait. The foreign ministers of the six Gulf states, along with Egypt and Syria, met on 19 October in Cairo to discuss the crisis. Kuwait's foreign minister reaffirmed that Kuwait would not accept any solution less than Iraq's complete compliance with UN resolutions. The Arab League called on Iraq to show restraint. It was U.S.-led resolve that determined the crisis outcome.  On 10 November Iraq's National Assembly formally declared "Iraq's recognition of the sovereignty of the state of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence." This statement, signed by President Saddam Hussein, terminated the crisis for all the actors. All except Iraq were satisfied with the outcome; Iraq suffered an unqualified defeat.
The most recent crisis between Ecuador and Peru over their disputed border occurred from 9 January to 28 February 1995. In January 1995, violence erupted once more over an undemarcated 78 km stretch of the Ecuador/Peru border that is reputed to contain gold, uranium and, possibly, oil deposits. Armed clashes between Ecuador and Peru began on 9 January 1995, although it is unclear as to which side fired first. Fighting intensified on 26 January. The next day, Ecuadorean President Sixto Durin Ballen proclaimed a state of emergency. Both armies called up reserves; and Peru's President Alberto Fujimori reportedly began to personally direct the military operation. The fighting was escalated further between 27 and 29 January. On the 29th President Durin claimed that Peru had opened a massive attack on four Ecuadorean bases, and an Ecuadorian communiqué claimed that a Peruvian helicopter had been shot down.  On 31 January officials from the two states jointly announced a cease-fire, following talks in Rio de Janeiro that were mediated by the guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol - the US, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. On 3 February negotiators for Peru and Ecuador reached an accord, to be submitted to their respective governments. However, fighting resumed in early February and seriously escalated on the 10th, when Peru launched heavy air attacks on Ecuadorean positions along the Cenepa river. Three Peruvian aircraft were shot down during the attacks. The US and Brazil announced that they were suspending all arms shipments to the two adversaries.  On 17 February the deputy foreign ministers of Peru (Eduardo Ponce Vivanco) and Ecuador (Marcelo Fernandez Cordoba) and representatives of the Rio Protocol guarantors signed a peace declaration at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia. Ecuador and Peru accepted the guarantor countries' offer to send observers to monitor the cease-fire, to separate the confronting forces immediately, to begin a "gradual and mutual demobilization" and to begin talks to resolve the dispute. The observation mission of the guarantor states began operations on 21 February. However, fighting resumed the next day and Ecuador accused Peru of using chemical weapons and flame throwers. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Peru (Efraim Goldenberg Schreiber) and the Ecuadorean Foreign Minister (Galo Leoro Franco) met with the guarantor mediators on 28 February in Montevideo, Uruguay. The next day a cease-fire took effect; the parties reiterated their commitment to the Itamaraty peace declaration and accepted the "immediate presence of observers" from the Rio guarantors to supervise the cease-fire. That agreement, on 1 March 1995, terminated this international crisis but did not yet resolve the territorial dispute. A permanent observer mission replaced the temporary mission on 30 March.  The UN was not involved in the crisis.  (Several other violent incidents were reported in mid-March, and on the 22nd 28th. On 26 April Peru announced that it had complied fully with the timetable for the separation of forces in the border zone. Ecuador declared its withdrawal from the disputed area the following day.)
China and the Philippines were involved in a crisis over a chain of islands in the South of China Sea from 2 to 15 February 1995. and Pre-Crisis  The potentially oil-rich Spratly islands are claimed, fully or partly by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. China has often fought in the South China Sea with its traditional rival in the area, Vietnam, most recently in a naval battle in 1986, when China captured six tiny islands. Formerly, China seized the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 and it virtually has claimed sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands, which contain vital shipping lanes.  This specific crisis between China and the Philippines erupted over Mischief Reef, a territory claimed by the Philippines and located 200 km from the Philippine island of Palawan. Following reports by a fisherman of Chinese activity in the reef, the Philippines sent a patrol boat to the area. A crisis for the Philippines began on 2 February 1995 when a patrol boat found that Chinese forces, including eight ships, had occupied Mischief Reef and established several permanent structures. The action was perceived as another stage of the advancement of Chinese territorial claims into the region, and raised fears that the Chinese were prepared to use force in posting claims to shipping lanes there.  President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines denounced the Chinese action as "inconsistent with international law," and on 8 February the Philippines issued a formal diplomatic protest to the Chinese government. The Chinese responded that the compound at Mischief Reef was built for use as a shelter by Chinese fishermen, not for any military purpose.  Although the Philippines government ruled out the use of force, its major response was to send warships and fighter planes to the area on 15 February, and to order a strengthening of the military forces on the islands currently under Philippine control. Since there were no further changes in the control of the reef, this terminated the crisis without resolving the Philippines claim to the reef.  The other countries concerned by the Spratly Islands - Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei - were not actively involved in the crisis. Nor were the US, Russia and the UN.
The fifth crisis in the protracted Taiwan Straits conflict began on 22 May 1995 and lasted until 25 March 1996. The Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) were both crisis actors. and Pre-Crisis  While a fundamental disagreement persisted between the PRC and the ROC about the potential independence of Taiwan, leaders of both countries made efforts in 1995 to ease tensions between the two actors. In a New Year's Day address, Chinese President Jiang Zemin had called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Beijing and Taipei, encouraging leaders in both capitals to work toward a mutually acceptable "one country, two systems" framework. In April 1995, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui responded to Jiang's statement with a call for greater economic cooperation between China and Taiwan and establishment of regular dispute resolution mechanisms for disagreements between the two. Optimism that these statements might lead to direct talks between Jiang and Lee receded in late April when Jiang noted that the conditions were not yet ripe for a summit meeting between the two leaders. Days later, scheduled working-level cross-strait talks were cancelled after representatives from both sides could not agree on an agenda for the meeting.  At the same time, Taiwanese officials were at work trying to secure a visa to allow President Lee to come to the United States to visit his alma mater (Cornell University in New York state). On 7 April, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher assured Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that, consistent with its long-standing policy, the US would not issue such a visa to the Taiwanese leader. Christopher warned Qian, though, that legislators in the US were pressuring the Clinton administration to allow Lee to visit. Officials in Beijing were especially concerned that a visit by Lee to the US would be a catalyst to a renewed and aggressive campaign by Taipei for an independent Taiwan, especially in light of Taiwan's upcoming presidential elections, in which Lee was hoping to become the first democratically elected leader of the island. A crisis was triggered for the PRC on 22 May 1995 when the US State Department announced that it would issue a visa to allow Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to make a private visit to the United States in June, thus reversing the US policy restricting high-level contacts between US officials and Taiwanese leaders, over the objections of Chinese officials. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian argued that the US action violated three joint agreements between the China and the US, represented a violation of Chinese sovereignty, and destroyed hopes of a peaceful resolution between mainland China and Taiwan. China cancelled or postponed a series of meetings between US and Chinese officials in subsequent months, but dialogue resumed between the two countries on a variety of officials by September.  The crisis also strained the already troubled relations between Taiwan and China. During Lee's 3-day visit to the US in early June, he met with members of the US Senate and House of Representatives and noted that the people of Taiwan were dissatisfied with their marginalized status in the international commuity. Cross-straits discussions between the PRC and the ROC were again postponed in early June, and China responded to this crisis by launching a series of military exercises in the East China Sea, lasting from 21 to 26 July. The exercises included a series of tests of M-9 surface-to-surface guided missile tests that were fired only 60 km north of Taiwan's Pengchaiyu Island. These military maneuvers were coupled with fiery rhetoric from the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, which called on China to be willing to spill blood and lose lives in efforts to stop what it considered to be moves by Lee towards potential independence for Taiwan. These military exercises and rhetoric triggered a crisis for Taiwan, which responded on 27 July with a special address from President Lee in which he noted that Taiwan could not be repressed by outside forces.  The cycle of Chinese military exercises and missile tests, followed by statements by Lee that Taiwan would not be intimidated continued through 1995 (notably in August, September, and October), and by early 1996, the PRC had redeployed forces to coastal areas facing Taiwan and had set up additional command structures with responsibility for potential military action against Taiwan. Chinese military maneuvers peaked with war exercises only about 25 miles off of the Taiwan coast in March 1996 in anticipation of Taiwan's first democratic presidential elections and were seen as an effort to hurt the electoral chances of President Lee. Despite the threatening tests, the elections were held, as scheduled, on 23 March 1996, and Lee Teng-hui became the first elected president of Taiwan. As scheduled, China's military exercises stopped after the elections, thus ending the crisis for both the PRC and the ROC.  Taiwan attempted to involve the UN in this crisis by submitting an application for Taiwan's membership to the organization, but the application was not approved. The UN was not a major actor in this crisis, and there were no mediation efforts during the crisis. The US was involved not just in triggering the crisis for the PRC but also by helping to ensure the safety of Taiwan by sending the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to the Taiwan Straits in December 1995, marking the first time US ships had patrolled the area since 1976. Additionally, carrier battle groups were sent to the region in March 1996, during the election period prior to the conclusion of this crisis.

Yemen and Eritrea experienced a crisis over three Red Sea islands from 15 to 31 December 1995. and Pre-Crisis  A dispute between Yemen and Eritrea broke out in November 1995 over three Red Sea islands, in which a small Yemeni fishing community lived. Greater Hanish, the main island in a chain between the two states, is nearby one of the world's major shipping lanes, 100 miles north of the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Eritrea had laid claim to the islands on what it described as historical grounds, as it acknowledged that its forces had been based on the Red Sea islands since its 30-year war against Ethiopia, after which Eritrea won independence in 1993. The two states were concerned with establishing rights over fishing, tourism and mineral exploitation.  Eritrea claimed that Yemen first put troops on the Hanish islands in early November. Yemen contended that tension was raised after Eritrea ordered all Yemenis off the islands on 11 November. Eritrean naval patrols tried to land on the islands and Yemen increased its military presence there.  A senior delegation, including Eritrea's Foreign Minister Petros Solomon, and Resources Minister Saleh Meki, visited Yemen on 22 November in an attempt to resolve the dispute peacefully. A Yemeni delegation headed by Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime-Minister Abdul ali al-Karim al-Iryani held talks with Eritrean officials in Asmara on 7 December. The two countries agreed to resolve the dispute through diplomacy in a further round in Yemen. Eritrean forces attacked the Hanish islands on 15 December 1995 and captured the largest -- Hanish al kabir (Greater Hanish) -- after three days of fighting, involving warships and aircraft from both sides. That triggered a crisis for both states. The next day Yemen accused Eritrea of invading the islands in a "treacherous act of aggression."  In a telephone conversation between President Ali Abdullah Salih of Yemen, and Eritrea's President Isseyas Aferworki on 17 December, the two leaders reached a truce in the fighting. However, the next day Yemen claimed that Greater Hanish had been completely occupied by Eritrean forces, which had broken the truce. Eritrea claimed that the island was captured before the truce. The cease-fire between Yemen and Eritrea took effect on 18 December, and they agreed to have it monitored by a committee of four, comprised of a Yemeni and an Eritrean representative, and officials from the US embassies in the two states. The UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, arrived in Sana'a on 29 December to mediate the dispute. After meeting with representatives from both sides and facilitating discussions on the matter on the 31st, he announced that Yemen was ready to withdraw its forces from the islands and to accept international arbitration. This terminated the international crisis.  (An agreement between Yemen and Eritrea was signed in Paris on 21 May 1996 to settle their dispute over the Hanish islands by arbitration. The two sides agreed not to use of force and to accept the verdict of a special arbitration tribunal. )
Greece and Turkey experienced another crisis in the Aegean Sea from 26 to 31 January 1996. and Pre-Crisis  Several mini-crises over territory and resources in the Aegean Sea erupted between Greece and Turkey from 1976 onward (sea Cases #272, #349, #376 - Aegean Sea I, II, III). The two neighboring states failed to find a legal framework for regulating their disputes in shared waters, including the demarcation of the continental shelf and the extension of Greek territorial waters.  The uninhabited 10-acre island of Imia is located in the Dodecanese chain in the eastern Aegean, between the Greek island of Kalimos and the Turkish coast. Imia was used as a fishing station and a navigation guide. The most recent crisis between Greece and Turkey was over the sovereignty of Imia, recognized as Greek territory under the Paris 1947 convention, in which the Dodecanese islands were ceded to Greece by Italy after World War II in reward for Greece fighting against the Nazis. Italy had taken these islands from Turkey in 1932, but Turkey claimed the protocol that transferred sovereignty of the Dodecanes islands from Turkey to Italy was invalid because it had not been submitted to the League of Nations for registration.  Tension between Greece and Turkey was renewed on 26 December 1995, as a Turkish cargo boat, "Figen Akat," ran aground on Imia in Greek territorial waters close to the Turkish coast. The ship's crew refused help from Greek officials, claiming that they were on Turkish soil, called "The Kardak Rocks." However, on 28 December the ship left with the help of the Greek authorities, and Turkey issued a letter of protest, contesting Greek jurisdiction over the island. The next day, Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed a verbal note to the Embassy of Greece, asserting that the island constituted part of Turkish territory. On 10 January, Greece responded by claiming that its "national sovereignty" was "indisputable." On 26 January 1996, a month after the Turkish ship ran aground on the Greek island of Imia, the Turkish newspaper, Huriet, raised again the issue of the sovereignty of the Kardak Rocks. The same day, the mayor of the nearest Greek island raised the Greek flag on Imia. That triggered a crisis for Turkey, which sent naval forces to the area, triggering a crisis for Greece. On the 28th a group of Turkish journalists flew by helicopter to Imia, took down and tore the Greek flag and raised the Turkish flag, which was then proudly displayed over Turkish media. Greece responded the same day by deploying Greek marines to the island to restore the Greek flag, and nine remained on the island to guard it. Greece also took up the issue with the Turkish government and with the ambassadors of the Western European states, the US and Russia. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller declared that her country could not tolerate a Greek flag on a Turkish island, and soon several warships from both sides were arming their missiles around Imia as tensions escalated over the next few days.  On 29 January, Greece rejected a Turkish proposal for a bilateral dialogue to resolve the long-standing dispute between them. The same day, the Greek Ministry of Defense stated that Turkish and Greek fighter jets chased each other in the sky over the islet.  On 30-31 January the US envoy, Richard Holbrooke, mediated indirect negotiations between Greece and Turkey, and the US urged the two sides to return to the status quo before the crisis. Holbrooke’s mediation helped to decrease the tensions in the crisis, though it is unclear if it directly led to the termination of the crisis. On 30 January Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller declared that the Greek flag would come down, and that no foreign flag would fly on Turkish soil. The same day, Turkish marines occupied the nearby Greek uninhabited islet of Akroyialia, and a Greek helicopter that was sent to examine the situation fell into the sea, in an accident apparently due to bad weather.  However, the crisis ended the next day after the Greek flag was removed and troops from both states left the area. Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis declared that the crisis over Imia was resolved without any negotiation with Turkey on Greece's sovereign rights. Turkish Prime Minister Ciller announced that it was a victory for Turkey because they forced Greek soldiers off Imia and removed its flag from the island.  The EU Council of Ministers did not adopt a common position in the crisis. The European Parliament passed a resolution blaming Turkey for the crisis and supporting the previous status quo. Neither Russia nor the UN was involved in the crisis over Imia.
Israel and Lebanon experienced another violent crisis on both sides of their border from 9 to 27 April 1996. and Pre-Crisis  From the beginning of 1996 Hizbullah increased its attacks against Israel's forces in its South Lebanon "Security Zone." US pressure led to Syria's criticism of Hizbullah attacks against Israeli civilians in the settlements near the northern border. Hizbullah then confined its operations to Israel's Defense Force (IDF), as agreed in July 1993, at the end of the "Operation Accountability" crisis (see Case #409). The IDF responded with retaliation raids into South Lebanon. The freezing of the Israel-Syria peace process at the beginning of 1996 and the anticipated elections in Israel later that year encouraged Iran, Syria and Hizbullah to escalate attacks against Israel (executed by Hizbullah, backed by Iran and Syria), in order to gain political leverage.  On 8 April 1996 Hizbullah announced that a Lebanese child was killed and three other persons were wounded in a bomb explosion in South Lebanon, for which the IDF and the South Lebanese Army (SLA) were blamed. A crisis for Israel was triggered on 9 April by a major Hizbullah attack against Kiryat Shmona in Israel's northern Galilee, in which 36 Israeli civilians were wounded by 30 "Katyusha" rockets. In the exchange of fire between the IDF and Hizbullah on the following day, four Israeli soldiers were killed. Israel's major response was an air attack against Hizbullah bases in South Lebanon and targets in Beirut on 11 April.  This retaliation, which catalyzed the flight of tens of thousands Lebanese from the south towards Beirut, triggered a crisis for Lebanon. In spite of Israel's declarations that it had no intention to confront Syrian forces or the Lebanese Army, two separate incidents occurred, in which one Lebanese soldier was killed and two were wounded. Israel demanded that Lebanon enforce its sovereignty and prevent Hizbullah attacks against Israel from Lebanon's territory. On 13 April one Syrian officer was killed following anti-aircraft firing by Syrian forces against Israeli planes.  Lebanon's major response was to call for an urgent UN Security Council meeting on 13 April, and a consultation in Damascus between Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik El-Hariri and President Asad of Syria. While Hizbullah continued its attacks against Israeli settlements in the Galilee and Israel continued its retaliation on targets in Lebanon, El-Hariri also sought support in visits to Cairo and Paris.  The European Community (EC) and French President Chirac expressed "deep concern" over the increased tension in Lebanon and the Galilee. The Arab League condemned Israel's air attacks on Lebanon and called on the international community to force Israel to respect Lebanon's sovereignty.  On 14 April, after a meeting between Lebanon's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister with President Asad, Lebanon's Foreign Minister announced that his government was willing to return to the tacit understandings at the end of the "Operation Accountability" crisis in 1993 (see Case #409) and for the first time, was also ready to guarantee that no Hizbullah attacks on Israel would be launched from Lebanon's territory.  The US attempted to mediate a cease-fire by proposing a tacit understanding, along with a formal agreement to terminate the crisis. The latter was to include a cessation of Hizbullah "Katyusha" attacks from South Lebanon, along with Israel's pledge not to harm any Lebanese within Lebanon. The tacit understanding was to include a mutual Hizbullah-Israel pledge of comprehensive calm in South Lebanon. On 16 April the UN Security Council called on the parties to the crisis to end the violence. Russia called upon Israel to end its attacks on Lebanon, claiming that Israel's retaliation was out of proportion; and the UK also called on Israel to restrain its response to Hizbullah attacks. The French Foreign Minister, Herve De-Share, traveled to the Middle East and proposed a secret plan for a cease-fire. While Israel accepted the US proposal, Syria and Lebanon preferred the French plan, and were ready to return to the understandings of 1993.  On 18 April more than a hundred Lebanese, who fled their homes in South Lebanon to a Hizbullah camp next to a UN post in the village of Qa'ana were killed by an Israeli attack. That escalated the crisis, leading to the condemnation of Israel in the Arab world and in Europe. On the 21st, the foreign ministers of France, Russia, Italy and Iran, and the Hizbullah leader held talks in Syria regarding the violence in Lebanon. France expressed its willingness to send troops as part of a multinational force, to replace Israeli forces in South Lebanon. Israel rejected the proposal.  Hizbullah continued to launch attacks against Israel during IDF operations in Lebanon. The US decided to increase arms shipment to the Government of Lebanon in order to strength Lebanon's army and its ability to restrain Hizbullah.  The UN called for restraint on 18 April in Security Council Resolution 1052, to little effect. On 27 April 1996 the parties accepted a cease-fire: they agreed to cease attacks on civilians in Israel and Lebanon. The same day, the parties accepted a cease-fire: they agreed to cease attacks on civilians in Israel and Lebanon. They also agreed to establish a follow-up committee, comprised of the US, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and France, to act as a mediation forum and deal with complaints of any cease-fire violations. The 1996 "understandings" agreement was presented as a US document, designed to mediate between Israel and Lebanon, in consultation with Syria. Syria gave the US an oral commitment to restrain Hizbullah. The cease-fire of 27 April 1996 terminated the crisis for both Israel and Lebanon.
Between 31 August and 14 September 1996, the US and Iraq engaged in an international crisis, with significant involvement of Iran and Turkey. and Pre-Crisis  Following the Gulf War and failed Kurdish uprising in 1991, substantial parts of northern and southern Iraq became UN-protected zones, in an effort to inhibit the Iraqi government from violently suppressing minority groups. One of the groups that the exclusion zones intended to protect were the Kurdish people in the north, who were divided amongst themselves, most notably between the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). In this rivalry, the KDP sought Iraqi support, while the PUK sought the support of Iran.  In July and August 1996, the Kurdish conflict escalated, and the PUK made considerable military advances, with the apparent direct support of Iran. In late August, the KDP formally requested the assistance of Iraqi forces to repel the PUK positions. On 31 August 1996, an estimated 40,000 Iraqi troops intervened in the Kurdish civil war, on the side of the KDP. Iraq's forces quickly advanced and gained control of Arbil, which had recently fallen under PUK control. The Iraqi advances took place north of the 36th parallel, which had been explicitly protected under the 1991 agreements. This triggered a crisis for the US, which had been the leader of the coalition that implemented the restrictions on Iraqi military activity.  The US immediately increased air sorties over Iraq, and on 1 September 1996 President Clinton announced that the US would aggressively respond to Iraq's breach of the agreements. From 3-4 September, the US conducted Operation Desert Strike, unilaterally bombing Iraqi military positions and air defense systems with apparent success. A reported 6 Iraqi's died in the attacks, with dozens of injuries. The US also extended the "air exclusion zone" in southern Iraq from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel. Over the next week, the US attempted to gain support from its previous Gulf War allies and also pressured the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution condemning the Iraqi incursion. However, the US was unable to gain sufficient support from its allies, and, partly as a consequence, it was unwilling to escalate the conflict any further.  After the US bombardment, Iraq initially sought international support for the ability to intervene in conflicts within its own territory, especially when the involvement is at the request of one of the disputing parties. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein also lamented the extension of the exclusion zones, calling them "null and void." Moreover, Iraqi officials decried Turkey's creation of a "buffer" zone - in an attempt to prevent harmful spillovers from the Kurdish conflict - in northern Iraq. There was widespread condemnation for the Turkish action, many Arab nations condemned the US action, and Russia subverted a UN resolution to be adopted against Iraq by threatening a veto. However, no prohibitive action was taken against the US, and Iraq was left to fend for itself.  On 11 September 1996, Iraqi forces fired upon US fighter planes patrolling the exclusion zones. In response, the US destroyed the air-defense systems involved. On 14 September, Iraq declared that it would not fire upon anymore US patrols and that it would observe the exclusion zones. This declaration came after the US threatened to implement new air strikes and after Russia helped convince Iraq to comply. This ended the crisis for both actors, even though there was widespread distrust from the US and elsewhere that Hussein would actually comply.  It should be noted that while both Iran and Turkey were involved actors, they were not crisis actors. Even though both Iranian and Turkish forces were active on the Iraqi border and apparently conducted operations on the Iraqi side of the border, they never threatened to engage with Iraqi forces. The Iranian and Turkish activities were ostensibly solely related to the Kurdish factional fighting and not associated with acts of aggression against Hussein's regime.  (This crisis is distinguished from other frequent incidents that are not considered crises, in which the US has used military force against Iraqi air defense systems to police the exclusion zones. These incidents, which have occurred sporadically since the end of the Gulf War, do not constitute international crises because there have not been threats of escalation or tenable time constraints on action. However, such criteria were present in this Desert Strike crisis.)
South and North Korea were enmeshed in another bilateral crisis from 18 September to 29 December 1996. and Pre-Crisis  The Korean War ended on 27 July 1953 with an armistice (see Case #140 - Korean War III) but a formal peace agreement between the two Koreas remained elusive. Throughout the postwar period, both North and South Korea repeatedly affirmed their desire for reunification of the Korean peninsula. However, until 1972 there was no formal communication or contact between them. After several meetings that year, the two parties to this protracted conflict announced an agreement to work toward reunification and an end to hostilities. The process broke down a year later after South Korea's President Park Chung Hee announced Seoul would seek separate membership of the United Nations.  The Poplar Tree crisis (see Case #274) in 1976 accentuated the tension and mistrust between the two Koreas. In 1988, South Korean President Roh Tae Woo called for renewed efforts to promote exchanges, family reunification and inter-Korean trade. South Korean firms began to import North Korean goods soon afterward, and direct trade began in the autumn of 1990.  Roh's initiative renewed momentum for dialogue. In 1991, the two sides signed a joint declaration on denuclearization: it called for a bilateral nuclear inspection regime to verify denuclearization of the peninsula, but it was never implemented.  Hostilities continued to flare in the early1990s, culminating in the North Korea Nuclear Crisis of 1993-94 (see Case #408). An official from the North threatened to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire" after talks in 1994 collapsed. In early 1996, the US offered to arrange a meeting between North and South Korea in order to negotiate a formal peace agreement between the two. However, tension rose again as a result of the penetration of the South by a North Korean submarine. A crisis for South and North Korea began on 18 September 1996 when a North Korean submarine ran aground on a South Korean beach, about 100 km south of the border. The 'spy' submarine carried 26 armed commandos, who landed on the shore and raised tension between the two Koreas to the highest level in years. The South Korean armed forces launched a huge manhunt in which 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans were killed. During the operations the South Korean troops found a roll of film, containing detailed pictures of Kangnung Airport, Yongdong Power Plant and other facilities, which the infiltrators had taken after they penetrated the area. The primary mission of the infiltrators was believed to have been to assassinate South Korean VIPs who were scheduled to participate in a national athletic event that was about to take place in Chunchon.  South Korea denounced the incursion as an act of war. North Korea responded that the submarine was engaged in "routine training" and ran aground off the Korean coast due to engine trouble; and on 26 September it demanded the return of the submarine.  The crisis escalated on 1 October, when President Kim Young Sam of South Korea declared that his government would reconsider any further aid to North Korea and claimed that the submarine incident was proof of the North's plans "to communize the South with arms." He also warned Pyongyang that his armed forces were ready to respond to a military attack. South Korea also demanded an apology from the North before it would consider resuming peace talks between the two adversaries or providing further humanitarian aid to the North.  At this point, the U.S. intervened in the crisis as a mediator, through the efforts of President Clinton and a State Department negotiator, Mark Minton. Clinton met South Korea's president and urged him to resume talks with North Korea. After three weeks of intense negotiations in New York between Minton and a senior official of North Korea's Foreign Ministry, Li Hyong Chol, North Korea apologized on 29 December, expressing "deep regret" for the incursion and for "the tragic loss of human life." This terminated the North Korea submarine crisis.  (A day after the apology, the US administration announced that North Korea agreed, for the first time, to discuss with South Korea and the United States a formal end to the Korean War. That day, too, as a conciliatory gesture, South Korea returned to North Korea the remains of the 24 commandos who were killed during the crisis.)
A rebellion in eastern Zaire led to another international crisis for Zaire and Rwanda, which escalated into an eight-month civil war in Zaire, from 8 October 1996 to 16 May 1997. and Pre-Crisis  The Tutsi victory in the Rwandan civil war in 1994 ended in a predominantly Tutsi Patriotic Front government (FPR) in Rwanda, and bases of Rwandan Hutu refugees camps in the Kivu region in eastern Zaire. During 1996, the extremist Hutu Interahamwe militia, backed by the Zairean Armed Forces (FAZ), ousted thousands of Banyamulenge - ethnic Tutsis - from the Masisi region in North Kivu, in order to use the area for cross-border raids into Rwanda.  In the weeks prior to the crisis between Zaire and Rwanda, the Interahamwe militia tried to expel Banyamulenge forces from South Kivu, who were well armed and trained to fight back. In September 1996, fighting between the two ethnic groups flared up, and Zaire accused Rwanda of arming the Banyamulenge. Rwanda denied the charge.  In October, a major rebellion by the Banyamulenge in eastern Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila - the coordinator of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire-Congo (ADFL) - threatened the integrity of the state, whose president Mobutu Sese Seko had traveled to Switzerland for cancer treatment, and brought Rwanda and Zaire to the verge of war. On 8 October 1996, the deputy governor of South Kivu, Lwasi Ngabo, threatened to treat the Banyamulenge as rebels and to expel them unless they left Zaire in 6 days. As a result, about 1,000,000 Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi, that lived in these camps, began to flee to the hills north of Uvira. The same day, a 4000-strong (Tutsi) Banyamulenge and ADFL force attacked the ill-prepared Zairean army and the refugee camps of the (Hutu) Interahamwe. That triggered a crisis for Rwanda and Zaire. On 23 October, the Zairean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, Adml. Mavua Mdima, claimed that Rwanda and Burundi had trained and armed the rebels. Both states denied the charge. On 29 October, Zaire declared a state of emergency in the Kivu region and imposed military rule. The same day, the Rwandan town of Cyangugu was shelled by Zairean troops. In response, Rwanda deployed troops to eastern Zaire on the 30th, and its Vice-President and Minister of Defence, Paul Kagame, warned that his country was ready to fight Zaire "if Zaire brings the war to us." Kagame also said that Rwanda would not allow Zaire to expel the Banyamulenge by force, yet denied that Rwanda was helping the rebels.  Meanwhile, the ADFL and the Banyamulenge forces captured Bukavu, and by the end of the month were advancing on Goma - the capital of North Kivu. The successful attacks by the rebels and the creation of a buffer zone between Rwanda and Zaire, strengthened the Zairean claim that the rebels were supported by Rwanda. The failure of the Zairean army, on the other hand, and the absence of President Mobutu from the country during the crisis, threatened Zaire's political stability and created fear of a coup against its government by the Zairean army. On 1 November, Zaire Parliament called for the expulsion of all Tutsis from Zaire. The next day, the ADFL, backed by the Rwandan army, captured Goma and took control of North and South Kivu. That day, thousands of people demonstrated in Kinshasa, the Zairean capital, demanded war against Rwanda and Burundi, and attacked the homes and businesses of Tutsis. On 6 November, the ADFL's military commander, Andre Ngandu Kissasse, declared that the ADFL wanted to liberate the entire country, including Kinshasa. The fighting in Kivu had displaced more than 1.1 million Rwandan and 143.000 Burundian Hutu refugees, and an unknown number of local Zaireans.  On 21 October, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned that "we are heading for a humanitarian crisis" if the international community did not intervene immediately. On 4 November, the ADFL declared a cease-fire to allow the refugees to return to Rwanda; and on the 11th it agreed to allow humanitarian aid; but the international concern for the refugees continued to increase. On 7 November, France and Spain proposed a UN-sponsored force to eastern Zaire. The US, Canada, the UK, South Africa and some other African states approved the proposal. The US also agreed to send 1,000 American troops. The UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, asked the European states to prepare a multinational military force, to insure the security of the aid workers in Zaire, and by 14 November such a force was ready. However, after Rwandan refugees began to return, the international community reevaluated the situation; on 22-23 November, representatives of 29 countries and 6 humanitarian agencies called for a cancellation of the multinational military force to Zaire, at a meeting in Stuttgart, Germany.  Meanwhile, the ADFL announced the termination of the cease-fire on 21 November, and began to strengthen its control in the Kivu region. At the end of 1996, the ADFL in collaboration with Rwandan, Burundian and Ugandan forces, launched an offensive along the eastern border of Zaire and took control of a 900-mile-wide part of eastern Zaire.  On 20 January 1997, the Zairian government announced that it would "wage war" against the Alliance rebels. On 9 February, the ADFL launched a new offensive and, by the 12th, had captured Isiro in the north and were moving toward Buta. Zaire had tried to supplement its army with some 300 foreign (white) mercenaries from Belgium, France, Bosnia, Serbia and South Africa. It was also assisted by Morocco, Sudan and Libya.  In February, the Security Council endorsed a five-point peace plan and entrusted Special Envoy Mohamed Sahnoun with the task of implementing it. In March, as the situation in Zaire deteriorated, an international force of more than 1,000 troops - most from the United States, France and Belgium - was stationed in neighboring Congo in case it became necessary to evacuate non-Zairian nationals from the country. On 20 March, President Mobutu of Zaire called for a cease-fire, and the next day he returned to Zaire. Peace talks between government and rebel representatives began on 5 April in South Africa, and on the 9th the US urged Mobutu to resign. The next day Kabila demanded Mobutu's resignation within three days or his forces would march toward the capital, Kinshasa. On 12 April, Mobutu agreed for the first time to meet with Kabila.  On 23 April, the U.N. refugee agency expressed "deep concern" over reports that rebels had killed many Rwandan Hutu refugees at camps near Kisangani, and accused the rebels of pursuing a "policy of slow extermination." On 27 April, Kabila gave the UN 60 days to repatriate more than 85,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees or "we will do it ourselves." The next day, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson flew to Zaire to try to broker an end to the crisis.  In the peace talks between President Mobuto and rebel leader Kabila, mediated under the leadership of South African President Mandela on 4 May, Mobutu proposed to hand power to the winner of an election in which he would not be a candidate, but Kabila demanded that Mobutu would step down immediately and cede authority to his rebel forces.  The peace talks resumed on 15 May: mediators held talks with representatives from both sides, focusing on terms for Mobutu's quick resignation. On 16 May, President Mobutu gave up power, ending 32 years of rule over Africa's third-largest nation, and left the capital. Mobutu's departure terminated the international crisis, arising from Zaire's civil war. On the 17th, as ADFL forces entered Kinshasa, Kabila announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and declared himself president of the state.  (The country had been known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1964 until Mobutu changed it to Zaire in 1971. On 23 May the United Nations was informed of the changes in the country's name, leadership, national anthem and flag. On 7 September, Mobutu died in exile in Morocco.)
Iraq and the United States were engaged in the fourth crisis of the protracted conflict between the two states from 13 November 1997 through 23 February 1998. As one of the conditions of the ceasefire agreement that ended the Gulf War, UN Security Council Resolution 687 called for Iraq to give up all weapons-of-mass-destruction capability. This resolution called for the creation of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) to oversee and assist with the elimination of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs, while the International Atomic Energy Agency was tasked with working with Iraq on dismantling its nuclear program.  While Iraq accepted the provisions of Res. 687 and the authority of UNSCOM in April 1991, it soon became clear that UNSCOM inspectors would experience many obstacles, including repeated efforts by the Iraqi government to deny inspectors access to suspected weapons sites. Between the summer of 1991 and the summer of 1997, the UN Security Council passed seven resolutions demanding that Iraq cooperate fully with UNCSOM inspectors and make clear and transparent efforts to destroy its chemical and biological weapons programs. (See UN Security Council Resolutions 699 (1991), 707 (1991), 715 (1991), 949 (1994), 1051 (1996), 1060 (1996), and 1115 (1997).) While UNSCOM's inspection efforts are repeatedly thwarted by the Iraqi government, inspectors did find sufficient evidence during this period to confirm global suspicions that Iraq had developed an offensive biological weapons program and that they had actively pursued chemical agents as well.  In early October 1997, Richard Butler, the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM, submitted to the Security Council the semi-annual review of the commission's work in Iraq. The report indicated that Iraqi officials continued to prevent inspections throughout the country and that Iraq had yet to offer a "remotely credible" account of its weapons programs. While Iraq denied the assessment contained in Butler's report, the Security Council began negotiations to determine what further sanctions can and should be levied against Iraq. On 23 October 1997, the Security Council passed Resolution 1134, threatening a travel ban on Iraqi officials and suspension of discussions about lifting economic sanctions against Iraq if the regime continued to fail to cooperate with UNSCOM. Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, replied to the resolution by calling for the exit from Iraq of all US personnel working with UNSCOM, as these personnel were considered to be a direct threat to Iraq's national security. Iraq soon rescinded this demand, but the US government continued to work with the Security Council to ensure that "firm action" be taken against Iraq.  On 12 November 1997, the Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1137 which, among other things, again demanded from Iraq "immediate unconditional access" for UNSCOM inspectors to all potential weapons sites and imposed the previously threatened travel ban on Iraqi officials who had disrupted the work of UNSCOM. On 13 November 1997, the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) expelled all US inspectors working with UNSCOM. This response by the RCC to passage of Security Council Resolution 1137 triggered a crisis for the United States. The US's major response the following day was to mobilize its military forces in the Persian Gulf. On 14 November 1997, US President Bill Clinton sent the US aircraft carrier George Washington to the region and accepted UK's offer to send an additional carrier to the Mediterranean Sea as a "precautionary measure." On 20 November, Clinton ordered additional military aircraft, including B-1 bombers to the Gulf. The rapid mobilization of US forces triggered a crisis for Iraq.  Several international actors tried to work with Iraqi officials, especially Deputy Prime Minister Aziz, in an effort to defuse the crisis. Most notably, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov worked with the RCC which, on 19 November, approved a Russian proposal that allowed all UNSCOM inspectors into Iraq but ensured that UNSCOM's efforts demonstrate respect for Iraq's sovereignty and security. This agreement proved to be fleeting, however; in late November, Iraqi officials violated the Russian-brokered agreement, again placing conditions on which sites UNSCOM could inspect.  Iraq's major response to this crisis occurred on 13 January 1998, when officials demanding the stoppage of the inspection work of an UNSCOM team, led by American Scott Ritter, that was investigating reports that Iraq has tested its chemical and biological weapons on prisoners. Iraq claimed that Ritter had committed acts of espionage during his time in Iraq. The expulsion of Ritter triggered another round of negotiations in the UN Security Council, which was greatly divided about how to secure Iraqi cooperation with UNSCOM. Throughout January and February 1998, the US worked to gain support for a military strike against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. While the UK agreed with the US plan to force Iraqi compliance with Security Council resolutions, the remaining permanent members of the Security Council-France, China, and Russia-favored a diplomatic resolution and argued against the use of force.  This crisis came to an end on 23 February 1998. While negotiations between Richard Butler and Tariq Aziz in late January, and additional mediation efforts by Russian officials in early February, had failed to resolve the crisis, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled to Baghdad on 20 February to attempt to carve out an agreement between Iraq and the UN that would resolve the crisis. On 23 February, Annan and Aziz signed a "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) that re-affirmed the authority and mandate of UNSCOM and provided for inspectors' access to what Iraq had deemed "presidential" or "sovereign" sites. The MOU specified the procedures which UNSCOM inspectors would follow in order to gain access to these sovereign sites. President Clinton gave provisional endorsement of the agreement, noting that US would continue to exert military pressure on Iraq until it complied fully with the terms of the new agreement. On 2 March 1998, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1154, endorsing the provisions of the MOU between Iraq and the United Nations.
A crisis between Cyprus and Turkey began on 24 January 1998 and was terminated on 29 December 1998. and Pre-Crisis  In January 1997, the Cypriot government placed an order for the purchase of Russian made S-300 surface to air missiles. The S-300 has a range of about 140 kms, and would reportedly overturn the air superiority of the Turkish forces in the island. Several European governments, the US and the UN urged the Cypriot government to cancel the purchase to avoid further tensions with Turkey. While refusing to cancel the order, the Greek Cypriot government stated that there was no fixed date for the missile deployment. It added that the purchase was partly intended to focus international attention on the need for a solution to the wider Cyprus problem. The trigger to the crisis was the completion of a military airfield base alongside the civil airport in Paphos on 24 January 1998. The site was to be protected by the S-300 missiles. The completion of the airbase triggered a crisis for Turkey, which perceived it as a potential military threat to its airspace. The Turkish government warned that it may use force to prevent the deployment of the missiles. The threat of military action by Turkey triggered a crisis for Cyprus in late January 1998. Greece, although not an actor in this crisis, said that it would regard such an attack as cause for war with Turkey.  Concerned with the volatile situation, the EU threatened to suspend its accession talks with Cyprus if the weapons deployment were to occur. Following intense pressure from the EU, the US and the UN, and detailed discussions with Greece, Cyprus announced on 29 December 1998 that it was canceling its plans. The missiles would now be deployed on the Greek island of Crete, which meant that the Turkish airspace would no longer be threatened by the weapons. This was the end of the crisis. However, the Turkish government claimed that the deployment of the missiles in Crete would aggravate relations between NATO allies, Turkey and Greece.  The United Nations, the European Union and the United States expressed concern over the situation. The UN called for a cancellation of the missile order. There was no mediation in the case.
A crisis occurred between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 6 May 1998 to 12 December 2000, with both countries accusing the other of having invaded their sovereign territory. According to US estimates, the war led to the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and the displacement of 650,000 people. and Pre-Crisis  Eritrea became an independent nation in 1993, following a referendum on its secession from Ethiopia. Eritrean rebels had played an important role in establishing the Ethiopian government in 1991, and relations between the two countries had been cordial since the secession. The two countries were also linked by important economic agreements and had only recently ceased to use the same currency. The confrontation in May 1998 was a shock to the international community. On 6 May, border fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers triggered a crisis for both countries. It is unclear which side triggered the hostilities. On 13 May 1998, the Ethiopian Council of Ministers issued a formal statement, in which it accused Eritrea of having used military force on 6 May, to occupy an unspecified area of northwestern Ethiopia. On 14 May, the Eritrean government countered that the 6 May incident involved Ethiopian forces attacking Eritrean soldiers on Eritrean territory. Ethiopia subsequently diverted its imports and exports from Eritrean ports to Djibouti, allegedly because Eritrea was preventing Ethiopian access to its ports. Despite attempts by regional and international leaders to mediate, by late May, both countries had mobilized further troops and dug trenches inside the disputed areas. The situation rapidly escalated to a full-scale war.  With the onset of the rainy season, there was a scaling down of ground fighting at the end of May 1998. On 16 June 1998, Ethiopia and Eritrea ended air attacks, but the conflict remained far from settled. A peace plan, originally drafted by the US and Rwanda, and endorsed by the OAU, was proposed to the countries by the Congolese president. The plan asked for Eritrea to unilaterally withdraw from the territory where hostilities broke out on 6 May. Ethiopia accepted the proposal, but refused to engage in peace talks until Eritrea withdrew. The peace bid failed when the plan was rejected by Eritrea, which insisted that the occupied territory rightfully belonged to it. Renewed fighting broke out in the Badme region on 6 February 1999, the first major violence since the bombings had stopped the previous year. Fighting continued until 14 July 1999, when the two countries tentatively accepted on OAU-proposed peace plan. About eight months of relative calm ended with the sudden outbreak of fighting on 23 February 2000 on the Bure front, about 70 km west of the Eritrean port of Asab. Each side accused the other of starting the violence, with Eritrea alleging that Ethiopia had launched the attack to coincide with a visit to the area by an OAU envoy. Fighting eventually ended when the OAU-brokered peace agreement was signed on 12 December 2000.  Even during the lull periods in the war, there were continuous minor clashes as well as expulsions of citizens of the opposing country in both nations. The mutual expulsion of enemy nationals was a major issue in the conflict. In July 1998, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern regarding the harassment of Eritreans being expelled from Ethiopia, a charge dismissed by the Ethiopian government. By late 1998, each country claimed that the number of its nationals that had been expelled exceeded 30,000.  Early in the crisis, delegations from Djibouti and then the US attempted, unsuccessfully, at mediating between the warring neighbors. Finally, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), with backing from the UN Security Council was able to reach a substantive agreement on 18 June 2000. The agreement was formalized on 12 December 2000, signaling the termination of the crisis. The internationally brokered agreement was also signed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. In effect, the agreement returned both sides to their positions before the war, with the Eritrean government agreeing to withdraw its troops from all territory captured from Ethiopia during the crisis. Under the agreement, a UN force of about 4,200 peacekeeping troops would patrol the border, arrange the exchange of prisoners, supervise the return of displaced persons and deal with compensation claims.
India conducted nuclear tests on 11 May 1998, triggering a crisis for India and Pakistan. This was followed by Pakistan's own tests later in the month. The crisis terminated on 11 June 1998, when Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests. and Pre-Crisis  Following national elections in March 1998, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) formed a coalition government in India. It was widely believed that the coalition government would follow a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly towards neighboring Pakistan. Shortly after the elections, the government announced that it would exercise the option to develop nuclear weapons, a shift from the country's previously ambiguous stand on the issue. In April 1998, Pakistan tested its medium-range surface-to-surface Ghauri missile, capable of reaching Indian territory. This heightened tensions between the two countries. In the same period, there were reports of heavy artillery fire exchange between the two countries. In May, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes declared that China posed the greatest potential security threat to India and accused China of providing nuclear technology to Pakistan. China, however, dismissed Mr. Fernandes's comments as "ridiculous." The trigger to the crisis was a series of nuclear tests conducted by India on 11 May 1998 and 13 May 1998, which put both India and Pakistan in a state of crisis. Tensions rose further on 18 May when Indian Home Minster Lal Krishna Advani announced that India would follow a "pro-active" policy towards alleged Pakistani interference in Kashmir. On 21 May, however, India softened its line by announcing a self-declared moratorium on further nuclear tests, and offered to negotiate a "no first-use" nuclear pact with Pakistan.  Uncertainty surrounding how Pakistan would respond ended on 28 May 1998, when it announced that it had detonated five nuclear devices that day. The tests were preceded by intense pressure from the US government, including a telephone conversation between Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and US President Bill Clinton, when the latter urged Mr. Sharif not to proceed with the tests. In the aftermath of tests, the US imposed sanctions on Pakistan, similar to the ones already imposed on India. In both countries, the tests enjoyed widespread domestic support. The crisis ended on 11 June, when the Pakistani government announced a moratorium on nuclear tests and said that it was ready to formalize the arrangement with India and other countries.  The tests provoked international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions by several countries, including the US, Japan, Germany and Canada. The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, expressed deep regret over the tests and called for maximum restraint from countries in the region. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency session over the issue and called on both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The European Union and the G-8 expressed concern over the situation. There was no mediation in the case.
A regional conflict centered in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) erupted on 29 July 1998 and terminated on 30 July 2002. The DRC war has often been referred to as Africa's World War, as there were seven crisis actors (the DRC, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad), numerous peripheral actors, and resulted in the deaths of over 2.5 million people. In May 1997, rebel groups, backed by Rwanda, captured power in Zaire and deposed President Mobutu Sese Seko. The country was renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Laurent-Desire Kabila was installed as president. Relations between Kabila and the Rwandan government did not remain cordial for long, as the predominantly Tutsi government in Rwanda lamented that the Congolese government had not taken a stronger stance against Hutu militia groups accused of staging attacks against Rwanda from the DRC. Among growing tensions, in a decree on 29 July 1998, Kabila ordered all foreign troops to leave the country and dismissed James Kabarehe, a Rwandan Tutsi who had apparently been serving as his chief military adviser. This triggered a crisis for Rwanda. On 2 August, fighting broke out in Kinshasa, and the DRC government blamed Rwandan soldiers for starting the conflict. The rift between Kabila and his former allies had sparked a new rebellion, backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad sided with Kabila, and sent their troops in his support. As a result, the violent conflict that broke out on 2 August triggered a crisis for the DRC, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Chad. Uganda’s crisis was triggered on 21 August, when forces from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe mobilized and entered into the DRC (Chad’s forces mobilized one day later). Rebel forces, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, began to advance towards the capital, Kinshasa, in late August 1998. The intervention of troops from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad turned the tide and the rebels were pushed back. As the crisis continued in a cycle of rebel advancement and retreat, in July 1999, the governments involved in the war signed a peace agreement. The following month, troops from Uganda and Rwanda, clashed briefly in the city of Kinsangani, prompting frantic diplomatic efforts to ease tensions. The efforts seemed to yield some result: in the same month, the two principal rebel groups signed the agreement. Peace was, however, short-lived. In October 1999, allegations of ceasefire violations emerged, and in February 2000, renewed fighting broke out. In August 2000, leaders of the countries involved in the war met in Lusaka, but the summit broke down. In January 2001, Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard, and his son, Joseph Kabila, assumed power. In February 2001, Kabila met Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Washington, paving the way for peace talks. In February 2001, Ugandan and Rwandan troops began a pullback as a goodwill gesture. In November of the same year, however, a UN panel of experts restated its earlier assertion that the warring parties were deliberately prolonging the conflict, in order to plunder the region's rich natural resources, including gold, diamonds and timber. Many observers also believed that Angola's involvement in the war was driven by its interest in possible oil reserves in the area. In January 2002, amid ethnic clashes, Uganda reinforced its troop presence, fuelling fears that the war would continue. Negotiation rounds took place throughout the conflict, but without initial success. Notably, a cease-fire agreement brokered by President Chiluba of Zambia was signed on 10 July 1999 in Lusaka, Zambia. Although this peace accord received support from the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), the EU and the UN Security Council, it never achieved a tenable peace. Another major peace agreement occurred in Sun City, South Africa between the DRC and Uganda on 10 April 2002. President Mbeke of South Africa brokered the agreement, but it failed because Rwanda refused to agree to the power-sharing arrangements. The crisis for the system ended on 30 July 2002, after President Kagame of Rwanda and President Kabila of the DRC signed a peace agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. The conditions of the agreement called for a withdrawal of Rwandan troops in exchange for the disarmament of Rwandan Hutu rebels seeking refuge within the DRC. Although the Pretoria agreement only involved Rwanda and the DRC, it provided the crucial impetus for hostilities to diminish across the system and marked the end of all major confrontations among the crisis actors. (Uganda and DRC reached a formal peace agreement of their own on 7 September 2002, but this occurred after Uganda had already begun preparations to withdraw its troops.) At the actor level, the Pretoria agreement marked the end of the crisis for the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe, who all were actively involved in the conflict up until 30 July 2002. Angola, Namibia and Chad all unilaterally pulled out of the conflict prior to the termination of the crisis at the system level. Chad began to withdraw on 30 April 1999; Namibia complied with a UN-sponsored pull-out on 12 May 2001; and Angola announced its withdrawal of troops on 9 November 2001. The United Nations was active in supporting the peace efforts. For example, the Security Council approved observer troops to assist in the implementation of the Lusaka accords, and the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) was involved in mediation efforts. However, the effectiveness of the UN action was only marginal, as there was considerable disagreement about the mandate of the UN presence. The United States' involvement was primarily limited to political statements of approval or disapproval, and there is evidence that the US was covertly involved in training troops on both sides of the conflict. However, the US did not have a significant influence on the crisis dynamics.
Between 7 and 20 August 1998, a crisis occurred, pitting the US against both Afghanistan and Sudan. Osama bin Laden, a rich Saudi dissident, helped build and lead a militant Islamic network, known as al-Qaeda. Bin Laden and his network had a history of specifically targeting and threatening US and other Western interests, over resentment for the support of Israel and pro-West regimes such as that in Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden helped bring the Taliban to power in Afghanistan, and the Taliban, in turn, allowed him to use Afghan territory for training and building his network. His network also maintained a presence in other predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa, such as Sudan. On 7 August 1998, powerful bomb explosions occurred, almost simultaneously, near the US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salam, Tanzania. This triggered a crisis for the United States. It also triggered a crisis for Afghanistan, which was blamed for harboring Osama bin Laden, who was held responsible for orchestrating the attacks.  Over 200 people, mostly Kenyan nationals, were killed in the bombings; over 5000 were injured. Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, based in Afghanistan, was blamed for being responsible for the attacks. US President Bill Clinton was joined by world leaders in condemning the attacks on the two embassies. The US government demanded that Osama bin Laden be handing over to them by the Afghan Taliban regime.  On 19 August, Taliban chief Mullah Mohamed Omar said that the Taliban would protect bin Laden at all costs and would not hand him over to the US government. Following this, on 20 August, the US launched air strikes against targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. This triggered a crisis for Sudan. The two attacks focused on an alleged training base for terrorists about 100 miles south of Kabul, Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory capable of producing chemical weapons in Khartoum, Sudan. The Taliban claimed that about 15 people were killed in the air strikes; seven people were reportedly killed in the Khartoum strike.  The air strikes of 20 August signaled the end of the crisis for all three crisis actors. In the aftermath of this, however, the US government and Bin Laden warned each other of further attacks. The Sudanese government categorically denied that the pharmaceutical plant was making chemical weapons, and asked the UN to investigate whether the factory was making chemical weapons or legitimate pharmaceuticals. The US claimed that the factory had been making nerve gas.  This crisis had an important impact on the rules of the games in international politics. The Sudanese government intended to complain to the UN that the bombing had been undertaken without obtaining international support. The US government, however, asserted that it had been exercising its right to self defense after identifying bases linked to anti-American terrorist activity. The muted international response to US air strikes signaled a growing acceptance that self-defense could involve taking preemptive action, in addition to attacking direct threats.
From 1 October to 20 October 1998, Syria experienced a single actor crisis triggered by Turkey. Syria and Turkey have had a history of sour relations. The most salient issue of contention had been Syrian alleged support of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a civil war in southeast Turkey since 1984. Turkey specifically accused Syria of protecting and hiding the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan.  The two countries had also been at odds about water rights of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which flow from Turkey into Syria. Moreover, Syria has claimed sovereignty over the southern Turkish province of Hatay. Finally, Syria has felt threatened by a military-cooperation agreement between Turkey and Israel. On 26 September 1998, Israel and Turkey agreed to an arms deal, drawing the ire of many Arab countries including Syria. After Turkey's National Security Council (MGK) convened to discuss relations with Syria, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel announced on 1 October 1998, that Turkey reserved the "right of retaliation against Syria" for its "hostile attitude despite all our warnings and efforts and that our patience is about to be exhausted." The threats were primarily in reference to the alleged Syrian support of the PKK. Turkey also began mobilizing troops along the Syrian border, and there were reports of Turkish military aircraft violating Syrian airspace. Turkey also threatened to strike PKK camps in Syrian-controlled Lebanon. This triggered a foreign policy crisis for Syria, which immediately denied Turkey’s accusations and declared its intent to resolve the tension diplomatically.  After the Arab League urged Turkey to open "serious dialogue" with Syria, Egyptian President Mubarak began mediation efforts on 4 October with a visit to Syria, followed by a visit to Turkey a few days later. Mubarak warned Demirel that a Turkish military strike would lead to an "unending cycle of reactions and counter-reactions." During the meetings in Turkey, Demirel gave Mubarak a file listing the steps that needed to be taken to end the crisis.  On 8 October, Turkey gave Syria an ultimatum with 45 days to comply. The demands were for Syria to extradite Ocalan and to close down PKK camps in Syria and Syria-controlled Lebanon. On the same day, Iran's Foreign Minister, Kamal Kharazai, began additional mediation efforts, as he met first with Syrian President Hafez el-Assad and then flew to Turkey a few days later after a series of telephone conversations with both sides. In addition, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called on Turkey and Syria to decrease tensions in separate messages to the respective presidents.  However, the Egyptian mediation remained the primary vehicle for conflict management, as Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa delivered a "concrete message" from Asad to Demriel on 12 October that helped reduce some of the tension in the crisis. After Turkish and Syrian delegations met in Adana, Turkey, an agreement was reached that ended the crisis. Syria banned the PKK and its leader Ocalan, although it asserted that Ocalan was not in Syria at the time.  The UN Secretariat was minimally involved in the crisis, as Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the parties to resolve the dispute peacefully. The US and Russia also urged restraint on both sides.
A crisis erupted involving Iraq, the United Kingdom, and the United States on 31 October 1998. The crisis-the fifth in the Iraq/US protracted conflict-ended on 20 December 1998. Following Iraq's acceptance of a deal brokered by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in February 1998, weapons inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) were to be granted access to all potential sites within Iraq. (See Crisis #422, UNSCOM I, for more on this agreement.) By May 1998, the Security Council issued a statement that Iraqi officials were in compliance with the February agreement and that UNSCOM inspectors now faced fewer impediments to complete its inspection and verification work.  This cooperation between UNSCOM and Iraqi officials proved to be short-lived, however. During August 1998 talks, UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler requested that Iraq agree to the implementation of a more aggressive weapons inspection program. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's requested, demanding that Iraqi disarmament processes had been completed. Aziz also demanded that UNSCOM be restructured to reduce the disproportionate influence of the US. Aziz's comments were followed by a vote in the Iraqi National Assembly on 5 August for the suspension of Iraqi cooperation with UNSCOM. One month later, Resolution 1194-condemning Iraq's decision to discontinue efforts to work with UNSCOM-received the unanimous support of the Security Council. This resolution also suspended indefinitely the periodic reviews of UN economic sanctions in place against Iraq. While Aziz resumed discussions with UN officials, the Iraqi National Assembly condemned Resolution 1194. The assembly also called for an end to the limited UNSCOM monitoring it had allowed following the 5 August declaration.  On 26 October 1998, Butler reported to the Security Council the results of a two-day meeting of international experts, convened to review evidence collected by UNSCOM. The experts agreed that the evidence raised serious questions about Iraq's claims that its chemical and biological weapons programs had been dismantled. Following increased questions about the veracity of Iraq's claims that it has no chemical or biological weapons systems, Iraq announced that all UNSCOM activities in Iraq would come to an immediate halt. Cooperation would only resume, according to an Iraqi statement, after the Security Council reviewed the possibility of lifting sanctions on Iraq and after Richard Butler was removed as the UNSCOM chair. This announcement triggered a crisis for the UK and for the US. On 5 November 1998, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1205, demanding that Iraq "rescind immediately and unconditionally" its anti-UNSCOM pronouncements of 5 August and 31 October. This resolution, drafted by the UK, reflected the shared sentiment of the permanent members of the Security Council, but disagreements persisted about how to affect Iraq's behavior. As during the UNSCOM I crisis, China, France, and Russia believed that this crisis could be resolved through diplomatic means, while the UK and US maintained that the UN should consider using military force.  On 9 November 1998, the UK and the US announced increased military mobilization in the Gulf region, continued talks with potential allies in a military attack, and urged the evacuation of all UNSCOM personnel and aid workers from Iraq. These actions, indicating an increased likelihood of military hostilities, triggered a crisis for Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein responded to this trigger by re-opening talks between his officials and others in the international community. The major Iraqi response to the crisis occurred on 14 November, when Saddam indicated to a Russian diplomat that Iraq would cooperate fully with UNSCOM in the future. It is later discovered that US military jets were in the air, on their way to Iraq, when this announcement was made. The US maintained that it would launch an unannounced military strike if Saddam violated his latest commitment to working with UNSCOM.  In late November and early December, Iraqi officials resumed practices of denying UNSCOM inspectors access to information and sites, and on 15 December, Richard Butler reported to the Security Council that Iraq had not lived up to the promise of cooperation made on 14 November. On the evening of 16 December, the UK and US launched a series of air strikes on Iraq. The attacks, which continued until 20 December, were not authorized by the UN, but British and American officials argued that they were consistent with UN Security Resolution 1154, which guaranteed that Iraq would face the "severest consequences" if it did not live up to the memorandum of understanding signed by Aziz and Kofi Annan in February 1998. During 72 hours of bombing, UK and US forces struck more than 90 Iraqi targets.  The crisis ended for Iraq, the UK, and the US on 20 December when the military attack, named Operation Desert Fox, ended. At the end of the crisis, there was still no agreement within the UN Security Council about its policy toward Iraq, nor was Iraq willing to accept UNSCOM inspectors back into the country. In December 1999, the UN Security Council replaced UNSCOM with the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).
A crisis occurred among the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), ten NATO members (USA, UK, Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Canada and Portugal) and Albania from 20 February to 10 June 1999. and Pre-Crisis  Kosovo had been part of Serbia since 1913, even though its population is about 90% Albanian. The ethnic differences occasionally led to internal tensions and movements for Kosovar autonomy. In January 1998, a sequence of spiraling violence began between the Serbian police and the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK), which declared itself the armed forces of the Kosovo Albanians. The genocidal crackdown by the Serbs against the ethnic Albanians drew a great deal of international condemnation. In addition, there was concern about the flood of Kosovar refugees fleeing the region, and fears that the conflict would spread into the surrounding countries, threatening regional stability.  A UN Contact Group, comprising delegations from the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, was formed to pressure the FRY to engage in negotiations with the UCK. On 26 March 1998, the Contact Group sent a mediation delegation to Serbia to try to expedite the peace process. On 31 March 1998, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that placed an arms embargo on the FRY to further pressure the Serbians and Kosovar Albanians to end the violence. NATO also became involved in the situation and began to form contingency plans for troop deployment on 28 May 1998. Over the next eight months, NATO built up forces in the area, as negotiations between the FRY and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo stalled. In February 1999, a peace deal seemed to be near completion, and NATO insisted on sending its forces to ensure compliance, once it was signed. The 20 February 1999 deadline passed without an agreement. This triggered a crisis for the NATO members that were likely to use force, as NATO threatened to attack if a settlement was not reached by the 23rd. A tentative agreement for Kosovo autonomy was reached on 23 February, but only after there was evidence of heightened NATO mobilization.  Since the FRY failed to secure a lasting peace agreement, on 24 March 1999, NATO aircraft began an attack against FRY military targets under Operation Allied Force, triggering a crisis for the FRY. The bombing continued for three months. The NATO crisis actors primarily relied on air attacks and imposing an embargo to pressure FRY President Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiation table. The use of ground forces was often threatened but never implemented. While the NATO targets were only military and political in nature, the bombings occasionally extracted collateral civilian casualties. The most egregious instance occurred on 7 May, when a US bomb struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing four Chinese nationals. On 9 June 1999, leaders of NATO and the FRY signed a technical agreement that promised the withdrawal of FRY forces from Kosovo. The crisis ended for all actors the following day as the UN resolved to send a peacekeeping force to secure peace and monitor compliance.  Albania was the recipient of a large number of Kosovar Albanian refugees fleeing the FRY. In addition, a substantial portion of UCK activities was based in Northern Albania. The proximity of Albania to Kosovo and close ethnic ties to the Kosovar Albanians made Albania highly vulnerable to any spillover of the violence. In April 1999, there were reports of Serb forces shelling Albanian border villages, amidst heavy fighting between the UCK and the Serbs. At this time, the government of Albania accused the FRY of trying to spread the conflict beyond its borders. The FRY government also accused Albania of aiding NATO, even though the latter was not a member of NATO and did not take an active role in the attacks.  During the crisis, numerous instances of mediation occurred. US envoy Richard Holbrooke was mostly at the lead of the mediation efforts, both before and during the crisis. The UN and Russia were also periodically involved in attempting to broker a peace settlement. The final agreement was mediated by Finish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, but the mediation efforts only contributed marginally to crisis abatement relative to the impact of the destructive NATO bombing campaign. In addition to mediation, the UN was also involved in maintaining the arms embargo on the FRY and in indicting President Milosevic for war crimes. (Milosevic was not apprehended and prosecuted until after the crisis was terminated.)
India and Pakistan, enmeshed in a decades-long, protracted conflict were actors in the Kargil crisis, lasting from 9 May 1999 through 4 July 1999. Following the India/Pakistan nuclear crisis of 1998, efforts were made to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan. In February 1999, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met in the Pakistani city of Lahore for a two-day summit, which led to a Memorandum of Understanding that identified key measures both states could take to foster peace and stability between the countries. This spirit of cooperation appeared to be short-lived, however. In March, Pakistan unveiled a new missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead; leaders noted that such technology was necessary because of the enemy on Pakistan's border - India. The prospects of a successful Lahore process were further reduced in April, when both India and Pakistan tested missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. In late April and early May, skirmishes along the Line of Control (LOC) in Kashmir-which separates the Indian and Pakistani portions of Kashmir-grew more frequent and more intense. A crisis was triggered for India on 9 May 1999 when a rocket attack was launched on the Indian town of Kargil in northern Kashmir. India's leaders blamed Pakistan for the attacks, while Pakistan blamed the attacks on Kashmiri militants, not under the control of Pakistan. India's major response to the attacks occurred on 26 May 1999, when India attacked guerilla positions in Kashmir. The attack, conducted by jet fighters and helicopter gunships, represented India's first use of air power since 1971 and triggered a crisis for Pakistan. Pakistan responded to the attacks on the guerillas in Kashmir with a counterattack on 27-28 May, during which Pakistani forces shot down at least two Indian jets. Fighting continued and forces continued to mobilize through June as militants tried to re-occupy the mountains of Kashmir. Late in June, Pakistani military leader General Parvez Musharaf indirectly acknowledged that the Kashmiri guerillas consisted of a strong contingent of Pakistani forces. Indian leaders continued to demand that the guerillas withdraw to the Pakistani side of the LOC  On 2 July, Prime Minister Sharif requested assistance from the US to bring an end to the fighting in Kashmir. Sharif arrived in Washington on 4 July and, after a meeting with US President Bill Clinton, Sharif announced that Pakistan would withdraw all troops to its side of the LOC and that a cease-fire would be put in place following this withdrawal. Sharif also acknowledged that Pakistan would again recognize the sanctity of the LOC in Kashmir.  Throughout the crisis, the international community (including the US, Russia, China, and France) expressed grave concerns about the escalating violence in Kashmir, and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan offered to help mediate the situation. India rejected the mediation offer, noting that it did not want to internationalize the Kashmir issue.
A crisis between Indonesia and Australia broke out from 4 September to 10 October 1999, precipitated by violence between militia groups in East Timor. Australia led a peacekeeping mission, which involved minor support from 19 other countries. and Pre-Crisis  Indonesia had ruled East Timor since it invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Only India and Australia recognized Indonesia's authority over the region. In September 1999, Indonesia's President B J Habibie announced that a mush anticipated referendum would be held in the province to decide upon East Timor's independence from Indonesia. The referendum had been delayed out of fear that violence would erupt between pro-Indonesian and pro-independence militia groups, regardless of the outcome. The election was held on 31 August 1999. The election results were announced on 4 September 1999. Despite reports of widespread voter intimidation, the people of East Timor had voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. The election results immediately triggered widespread violence in East Timor, with pro-Indonesia militias being supported by factions of the Indonesian army. The outbreak of violence triggered an international crisis for Australia, which was committed to ensuring peace in an area so close to its borders, and Indonesia, which would have to quell the violence or deal with direct Australian intervention.  Australian Prime Minister John Howard had been under increasing criticism in his own country for his government's tacit support to the Indonesian government. As the election results were announced, and violence escalated, it became apparent that the Australian government would be taking action in the troubled region. The Indonesian government, while keen to have UN support for maintaining peace in the region, was highly critical of Australian involvement, which it viewed as unwarranted bullying and interference.  Nineteen countries joined the UN-authorized and Australian-led peacekeeping force, Interfet, which had the stated goals of restoring peace and security in the region, protecting refugees and safeguarding humanitarian aid for displaced people. A war of words ensued between the Australian and Indonesian governments, and there were several clashes between militias and Interfet. On 6 October 1999, Interfet troops in East Timor shot dead two pro-Indonesian militiamen in the first fatal clash since they were deployed. Interfet came under criticism for moving too slowly and putting humanitarian operations at risk, an allegation rejected by the Australian commander of the peace-keeping force in East Timor.  On 19 October 1999, Indonesia's parliament endorsed East Timor's independence vote, paving the way for the half-island to become the world's newest nation. The ratification signaled the end of the crisis, as UN peacekeepers prepared to take over Australia's role. While Australia achieved its objective of contributing to the restoration of peace in the region, the outcome was more ambiguous for Indonesia. Even though Mr. Habibie and other members of the government appeared to be in favor of granting East Timor independence, there was evidence that the Indonesian military, acting with some autonomy, had extended considerable assistance to pro-Indonesia militias responsible for mass killings in East Timor.  The United Nations was active in the peace efforts, and gave full support to Interfet. The United States was politically involved in resolving the crisis and contributed to the Interfet mission. There was no mediation in this case.  (East Timor received international recognition as an independent state on 20 May 2002, after over two years of direct UN advisement and protection.)
A crisis for Azerbaijan, in confronting a threat from Iran, occurred from 24 July to 2 August 2001 in the Caspian Sea. The Caspian Sea, which is rich in petroleum fields, is shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan. Subsequent to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the five states have failed to reach a new legal regime for the sea. While Iran favors an equal one-fifth share of the sea for each state, Azerbaijan prefers a demarcation which would reduce Iran's share to less than 20 percent. In July 2001, Iran warned oil companies about working with other states in areas of the Caspian Sea that it considers Iranian territory. On 24 July 2001, two geological survey ships from Azerbaijan, chartered by the British Petroleum Corporation to survey the Alov oil field, entered a disputed part of the Caspian Sea. The vessels were approached by an Iranian patrol boat and aircraft while surveying. The Iranian vessel maintained that the survey ships were in Iranian national waters and ordered them to withdraw. The vessels left, but this event triggered a crisis for Azerbaijan. The Azeri government filed a strong protest with the Iranian government over the incident. Iran, however, claimed that the vessels had trespassed into the Alborz oil field, which belongs to Iran.  The crisis terminated on 2 August 2001 when Azeri President Heidar Aliyev proposed mutual talks with the Iranian government. Although no agreement over Caspian Sea rights was established as a result of these proposed negotiations, a consensus was secured that hostilities would not escalate to violence.  Russia was involved in discussions with both the Azeri and the Iranian governments to help calm the situation. Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to mediate in the dispute; however, the offer was not accepted. The United Sates objected to the Iranian action and called it inconsistent with talks to resolve the dispute peacefully. There was no major UN involvement in the crisis.
A crisis involving US and UK forces against Afghanistan's Taliban regime, with Pakistan as a fourth crisis actor, began on 11 September 2001 and ended on 7 December 2001. and Pre-Crisis  The al-Qaeda network, a militant Islamic organization headed by Osama bin Laden, had been held responsible for numerous attacks against US interests, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack against US forces in Somalia in 1993. The network was based primarily in Afghanistan, although it had cells all over the world. Osama bin Laden's network helped bring the Taliban to power in Afghanistan, and the Taliban, in turn, allowed al-Qaeda to use Afghan territory for training and building its network. Although the Taliban maintained control of Kabul and most of the country at the time of the attacks, it did not enjoy complete control. A number of tribal groups had considerable autonomy in the south, and the Northern Alliance, a rebel group fighting against the Taliban, maintained some control in the north. On 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks were conducted against the United States, the most destructive such attacks in history. This triggered a crisis for the United States and its ally, the United Kingdom, which immediately pledged support in finding the perpetrators of the attack. It also triggered a crisis for Afghanistan, since the US blamed the country's Taliban regime for aiding and harboring al-Qaeda, the group held responsible for the attacks. Pakistan, Afghanistan's neighbor and one of only three countries with diplomatic ties to the Taliban, was also a crisis actor because it played a crucial role in facilitating the attacks against Afghanistan and bore many of the conflict's externalities.  The terrorist attacks on 11 September involved 19 men in coordinated suicide hijackings of four commercial jet airplanes, two of which destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and one which severely damaged the Pentagon in Washington, DC. The attacks left over 3,000 people dead in the United States, the largest peacetime losses suffered by the US since Pearl Harbor. The attacks shocked the international community, who denounced the attacks and largely pledged support for the US.  Soon after the attacks, US President George W. Bush pledged to take action against all states harboring or supporting terrorist activities. This was echoed by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Taliban regime quickly became the focus of attention in their role of supporting the al-Qaeda network. In the weeks after 11 September, the Taliban regime continued to deny support for the network and refused to assist in apprehending bin Laden and the other leaders believed to be responsible.  After significant military buildup in the region, US and UK forces commenced military operations on 7 October, consisting of cruise missile attacks and bombing sorties. Throughout the crisis, US and UK forces were primarily involved in using air attacks; however, there was also substantial effort of special forces operations on the ground. Moreover, the US and the UK coordinated their attacks with the infantry units of the Northern Alliance, which was successful in making gains against Taliban forces. They captured the capital city, Kabul, on 23 November 2001. In an unexpected development, about 90 Russian troops were deployed to Kabul after it had been conquered, but this did not affect the dynamics of the crisis.  Per other international influences in the crisis, another crisis actor was Pakistan, headed by President Pervez Musharraf. Pakistan's government was active in communicating with the Taliban regime during this period, in efforts to persuade Taliban leaders to hand over bin Laden. While many Taliban members had been educated and trained in Pakistan, Mr. Musharraf pledged support to the US government in its efforts to destroy the al-Qaeda base and capture Osama bin Laden. His support came despite widespread domestic unrest against US action in Afghanistan.  On 5 December 2001, an interim government to replace the Taliban was formed, headed by Hamid Karzai. The interim government emerged after efforts by the UN to mediate between the interested parties, including the ethnic and tribal factions within Afghanistan, as well as neighbors Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan. UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi began shuttle diplomacy on 27 October 2001 in an attempt to gain consensus for the formation of a provisional government. Deputy UN special envoy Francesc Vendrell facilitated discussions as well. These efforts culminated in the so-called “Bonn Meeting,” which took place from 27 November to 5 December. This meeting was brokered by the UN and included donor countries that pledged support for the transition process. During this meeting, the parties agreed to a two-step solution in which an interim government would be replaced after three months by an elected government with provisions for representation of the major factions and a two-year term. While the UN’s mediation efforts did not directly address the conflict between the Taliban and the U.S., these efforts played a crucial role in attenuating the international crisis. By helping to establish the provisional government, the UN helped to speed up the termination of the crisis and reduce the threat that the situation in Afghanistan posed to the U.S., UK and Pakistan. Pakistan indicated its unhappiness over the resulting arrangement, as the Northern Alliance is a rival of Pakistan and now emerged as the most powerful entity in Afghanistan. Pakistan's efforts to create an alternative to a Northern Alliance regime failed.  With a government in place to begin rebuilding the country, the crisis ended on 7 December 2001, after the fall of the final Taliban stronghold in Kandahar. Although the crisis ended and the Taliban had been defeated, Osama bin Laden remained at large, as did Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban regime, who escaped capture at Kandahar.  This crisis had substantial ramifications on the rules of the game in international politics. First, it demonstrated the unprecedented ability of a non-state entity to implement mass destruction, using dual-use weapons - technology that has a civilian purpose but can be used as a means of destruction. This marked a significant shift from the prevailing conceptualization of international conflict, which involves states using conventional weapons against other states. Second, the US and UK attack against Afghanistan was largely supported and sanctioned by the international community and the UN, whose central purpose is to stop sovereign states from attacking other sovereign states. The offensive against the Taliban was justified by redefining the concept of self-defense.
Another crisis for India and Pakistan was triggered on 13 December 2001 and lasted until 12 January 2002. This was the twelfth crisis between the states since 1947. Following the terrorist attacks on the US in September 2001, Pakistani President Parvaz Musharraf agreed to requests from US President George W. Bush to work with the US to remove the extremist Taliban government from power in Afghanistan and to seek out members of the al-Qaeda terrorist network, suspected to be living and training in Afghanistan. Pakistan was seen as an ally in Bush's "war against terrorism," but India was quick to point out to US leaders and to the international community that the Pakistani government had sponsored what it considered to be a terrorist campaign against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Throughout November, fighting along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir escalated between militant separatists, believed to be supported by Pakistan, and Indian forces. On 12 December 2001 a group of 5 armed gunmen stormed India's Parliament building in New Delhi, leaving 14 people (including all of the attackers) dead. This attack triggered a crisis for India, who blamed Pakistan for the massacre. As a result, the attacks also triggered a crisis for Pakistan. New Delhi police stated that all 5 attackers were Pakistani nationals, and the Indian government assessed blame for the attacks on two Islamic separatist organizations, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-i-Toiba (LiT), both of which India believes to be supplied and trained by the Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) agency of the Pakistani military. Pakistan's Musharraf condemned the attacks but demanded evidence that the separatist groups were to be blamed for the attacks.  Following the attack and assignment of blame, both India and Pakistan placed their military forces at a heightened alert status and escalated troop mobilization along the LoC as well as along the India-Pakistan border outside of Kashmir. On 21 December, India recalled its High Commissioner to Pakistan, for the first time since 1971. In addition, India cut off routes for land transport between the countries, and India and Pakistan both imposed a ban on the other country's airlines flying in its airspace. As the crisis continued into early January, the leaders from India and Pakistan both attended a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, but despite attempts by Musharraf, the two leaders did not speak to one another directly, and India continued to demand that Pakistan take responsibility for the Parliament attacks and extradite 20 alleged terrorists to India.  The crisis ended following a televised speech by President Musharraf on 12 January, in which he announced that Pakistan would be cracking down on terrorists in the country and in which he condemned sectarian fighting. While he did not accept all of India's conditions in this speech (notably, he rejected the extradition request), tensions between the two sides eased after this speech.  While there was no mediation in this crisis, there was notable international activity. US President George W. Bush spoke with leaders of both countries at the end of December, urging India to be cautious and Pakistan to be more responsive to Indian demands. In early January, British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited both India and Pakistan in an effort to ease tensions between the states.
Between 14 May and 17 October 2002, India and Pakistan experienced another crisis in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir after terrorists, who were suspected to be from Pakistan, carried out an attack on an Indian army base in Kaluchak. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been disputed between India and Pakistan since 1947. Militant activity in Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir had escalated in recent years. The Indian government alleged that Kashmiri separatists were actively supported, funded and trained by Pakistan. Since 11 September 2001, the United States government, as part of its war on terrorism, put increasing pressure on the Pakistani government to stem the flow of Kashmiri militants into India. While Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf gave his verbal assurances to this effect, violence in the troubled region continued. On 14 May 2002 Kashmir militants attacked the Indian army base in Kaluchak, in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Thirty-four people, including civilians and the attackers, were killed in the ensuing gunfight. The attack, the bloodiest in the region since October 2001, triggered a crisis for India, and there were calls for the Indian government to retaliate against Pakistan. Though no group claimed responsibility, Indian officials suspected Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. On 18 May India announced the expulsion of the Pakistani High Commissioner to India. India subsequently undertook a massive mobilization of troops along the Line of Control (the de facto border between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kashmir). The massive mobilization of troops by India following the attack and an escalating war of words between the two countries triggered a crisis for Pakistan on 19 May 2002.  Pakistan appealed for talks with India to defuse the situation and asked for foreign intervention. India retaliated by saying that it would not negotiate with Pakistan until the latter took concrete steps to crack down on militants. During this period, cross border firing – a routine event – escalated, and several civilian deaths were reported. On 27 May 2002, Musharraf made a defiant nationwide address where he said that Pakistan did not want war with India but would respond with full force if attacked.  The escalating tension between the two countries led to increasing worries in the international community. The United Nations General Assembly held discussions on the issue, but without resolution. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan also expressed concern. Russia offered to host face-to-face talks between Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee at an Asian conference in June, but India declined.  Both the United States and the United Kingdom were active in mediation efforts, with the U.S. playing the lead role. While the there were no direct negotiations between the two countries, the U.S. and UK engaged in a great deal of shuttle diplomacy. On 15 May, Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca made a trip to India and Pakistan on a peace mission. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage also visited the area in the ensuing months. On 25 May 2002 U.S. President George Bush made his first public intervention by publicly urging Musharraf to prevent incursions of militants into Indian-administered Kashmir.  Pressure from the U.S. had an important effect in reducing tensions. The crisis ended on 17 October 2002, when both sides announced a mutual demobilization of troops and a thawing of relations. This signaled the end of the crisis for both countries, as well as the end of mediation efforts. The stalemate over Kashmir, and Pakistan's support to militants, remained unresolved.
From 16 May to 15 October 2002, Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand experienced a crisis along Thailand’s northern border. Since the end of the Sleeping Dog Hill crisis (see Case #405), border tensions between Myanmar and Thailand remained tense, as rebel groups in Myanmar, including the Karen National Union and the Shan State Army rebels continued to battle the ruling junta and their ally, the ethnic Wa forces. Myanmar had long accused the Thai military of supporting the Shan rebels. On 16 May 2002, stray mortar rounds fired by Myanmar troops at Shan rebel positions landed inside Thailand, causing thousands of Thai people to flee from the border and triggering a crisis for Thailand. On the next day, Thailand submitted a formal protest and warned Myanmar that Thai forces would respond in kind if the shelling continued. Myanmar then accused Thailand of harboring rebel groups fighting in Myanmar. After more stray shells continued to land in Thailand on 20 May, the Thai troops responded by firing warning shots of artillery into Myanmar and, after the shelling from Myanmar continued, firing at Myanmar and Wa positions. On the same day, Shan rebels captured four Myanmar bases, and Myanmar blamed Thailand’s artillery support for this outcome. This triggered a crisis for Myanmar, which protested the retaliation and threatened military action against Thai forces.  On 22 May, Myanmar closed border-crossing points, disrupting trade and tourism between the two belligerents. During the subsequent five months, tensions remained at a high level, as stray Burmese shells continued to fall in Thailand, Thai workers were expelled from Myanmar, and the border crossings were not reopened. Moreover, Myanmar’s media began a strong anti-Thai propaganda campaign, which included banning advertising of Thai products and referring to Thailand as “Yodaya,” the Myanmar word for the old Thai capital that Myanmar forces sacked in 1767. Thailand protested the propaganda attacks, and the Thai media responded with accusations against the Myanmar junta government.  As relations thawed in September, and both sides appeared willing to deescalate the crisis, Thai Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Tej Bunnang visited Yangon, Myanmar to have talks with Myanmar’s Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win on 7 October. As a result of this visit, Myanmar decided to reopen the border crossings on 15 October. As part of the process, both Myanmar and Thailand agreed to address future disagreements jointly and to increase monitoring of cross-border flows. The reopening of the border terminated the crisis.
From 11-21 July 2002, Spain and Morocco engaged in a crisis about which has sovereignty over a small islet in the Mediterranean Sea. and pre-crisis  Parsley Island (Isla del Perejil according to the Spanish, and Leila or “Night” according to the Moroccans) is a small, uninhabited island in the Mediterranean Sea about 200 meters off of the coast of Ceut, a Spanish North African enclave claimed by Morocco. Ever since Morocco achieved its independence in 1956, the authority of the islet remained in dispute. In addition to the claim to sovereignty over the disputed piece of land, Morocco wanted to set up an observation post on Parsley Island to monitor potential security threats and illegal immigration across the Strait of Gibralter.  In the preceding years and months, relations between Spain and Morocco had plummeted, as Morocco was concerned with Spain’s support for the Polisario Front in Western Sahara (see Western Sahara protracted conflict), and Spain was concerned with the influx of illegal immigration and drugs from Morocco. In October 2001, Morocco withdrew its ambassador to Spain, and in July 2002, Spanish officials and members of the royal family declined to attend the wedding celebrations of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI. It was during this time of celebration that the crisis between Spain and Morocco emerged. On 11 July 2002, a dozen Moroccan soldiers landed on the island and hoisted a Moroccan flag. This triggered a crisis for Spain, as concerns grew that Morocco would try to similarly invade other, more important islands and enclaves in the region. The next day, Spain sent three navy ships to the area to monitor the situation, which triggered a crisis for Morocco. The troops on the island were poorly armed and were not prepared for a fight.  On 17 July, elite Spanish forces invaded the island, took control and raised two Spanish flags without any shots fired. The Moroccan troops were briefly detained and then released back to Morocco. Spain soon after promised to vacate the island if given assurances from Morocco that they would not try to retake it. After there were reports from Morocco that they had no intention to retake the island, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell helped solidify an agreement through a series of telephone conversations with King Mohammed of Morocco and Anna Palacia, the foreign minister of Spain. On 20 July, the foreign ministers of both Spain and Morocco announced that they had reached an agreement to return to the status quo and abide by the terms of agreement that Powell had proposed. On the next day, the Spanish troops withdrew, which terminated the crisis. (The respective foreign ministers signed a formal agreement in Rabat on 22 July, declaring their intentions to abide by Powell’s terms and to engage in future dialogue to improve relations.)
From 27 July 2002 to 7 October 2002, Georgia and Russia experienced a crisis along their common border. Tensions between Georgia and Russia are long-standing (see Case #407). Georgia had pushed hard for independence from the Soviet Union, and saw itself under threat from Moscow when a civil war broke out in the Georgian coastal region of Abkhazia in August 1999. Russia, in turn, has accused Georgia of allowing Chechen rebels to use the Pankisi gorge as a base for their fight against Russian forces. Russia had long sought permission to conduct military operations in the gorge, but Georgia rejected this. In February 2002, US military advisers arrived in Georgia as part of cooperative anti-terrorism efforts between the two countries. Russia expressed unhappiness over this and viewed such cooperation as an attempt to reduce its own influence in region. On 27 July 2002 Russia alleged that up to 200 rebels began crossing the border from Georgia and attacking Russian border guards, killing seven. This triggered a crisis for Russia. On 30 July 2002, Georgia accused Russia of conducting air raids into Georgian territory, triggering a crisis. Russia, however, denied the charges.  The following months saw an escalating war of words. Russia said that Georgia had rejected offers of Russian help to wipe out the rebels in Pankisi, while being unable to achieve any tangible results through its own military operations. Georgia retorted by accusing Russia of violating its territorial sovereignty. On 2 August, Georgia accused Russian troops of crossing into the disputed Kodori gorge in Eastern Georgia with troops from the breakaway regions of Abkhazia, a charge denied by both Russia and Abkhazia. Russia also accused Georgia of going back on a 1999 agreement that gave permission to Russian troops to pass through Georgia to reinforce their common border in Chechnya.  In August 2002, Georgia sent over 1000 troops into the region to flush out the insurgents. However, this did not pacify the Russians. In September 2002, the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov accused Georgia of aiding and abetting international terrorism and warned that Russia was ready to strike at Georgia in self-defense. In the same month, Russian President Vladimir Putin alarmed both Georgia and the U.S. by announcing that he had told his armed forces to draw up their own plans to deal with the rebels. The United States declared that it was strongly against any Russian military intervention in Georgia. It was widely reported that Russia’s threat to go into Pankisi was partially a warning to the U.S. to not invade Iraq, where tensions were mounting.  By October, tensions began to de-escalate. During this month, Russian and Georgian officials met during a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) conference. On 4 October 2002, Georgia extradited several suspected Chechen rebels who had been captured in the Pankisi Gorge in august. On 7 October 2002, Russia and Georgia agreed to set up joint patrols on their common border. This announcement came after Russian President Putin met his Georgian counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, in Moldova, where both attended a summit of former Soviet countries. This action terminated the crisis, and was followed by a formally signed agreement on 17 October 2002. There was no mediation provided by CIS.
From 12 September 2002 to 1 May 2003, the U.S., U.K. and Iraq were engaged in an international crisis that escalated to total war and the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. Terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September 2001 created a strong sense of vulnerability in the U.S. against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially to terrorist groups in the Islamic world. The fact that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had not allowed UN inspectors (UNMOVIC) into Iraq since the 1998 conflict (see Cases #422 and #429 -- UNSCOM I and UNSCOM II), had a history of using chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds, and had begun developing a nuclear weapons program that was revealed following the Gulf War (case #393 - Gulf War) made Iraq a state of paramount concern to the U.S. Although there was never any strong evidence that explicitly linked Iraq to support for Al Qaeda or the 11 September attacks, Iraq was seriously discussed as a potential threat to the U.S. as early as 15 September 2001, when a U.S. war council met at Camp David.  The U.S. first responded to its security concerns by invading Afghanistan, overthrowing the Taliban regime and destroying as much of the Al Qaeda infrastructure as possible (see Case #434). The conflict in Afghanistan had started winding down by December 2001, and the U.S. turned its attention to other potential threats across the globe. Even before the war in Afghanistan had run its course, President Bush reportedly directed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to draw up plans for military action against Iraq on 21 November 2001. On 28 December, General Tommy Franks reportedly gave President Bush his first briefing on the plans for a potential war against Iraq.  In President Bush's State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002, three potential threats against the U.S. were identified as constituting an "Axis of Evil." The three potential threats were Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Among these three states, Iraq was emphasized as being the most egregious threat to U.S. security. This was further indicated on 6 February, when U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell called for a "regime change" in Iraq that should be pursued unilaterally if necessary. Bush's State of the Union speech triggered threat perception for Iraq. The other two components of crisis, war likelihood and time pressure, were not yet perceived by Iraq after Bush’s speech.  Iraq responded with verbal protests against the U.S. hostility, and on 4 February expressed a willingness to meet with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Despite the diplomatic pleas for exoneration, the U.S. continued to ratchet up the pressure on Iraq. By 14 February, reports indicate that the U.S. had begun preparations for a military conflict in Iraq involving 200,000 troops.  Over the subsequent months, there were many developments with regard to the U.S. ability to muster international support for action against Iraq. Once again, the most important source of support for American activity vis-à-vis Iraq was the U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged to support the U.S. in a conflict with Iraq on 3 March, and reaffirmed that promise on 7 September. The Anglo-American alliance served as the principal driving force for the momentum against Iraq in providing both the justification for intervention and the bulk of the forces built up in the region.  However, the U.S. and the U.K. found it difficult to secure other sources of international pressure -- through the UN or otherwise -- as they continued to advocate action against Iraq. On 30 June 2002, France and Germany declared that they would not support military action against Iraq without a UN mandate. This was significant because France and Germany were important players with regard to the UN Security Council and would have been influential in forming greater European support for military action against Iraq. President Bush's administration perhaps began to recognize the benefit of establishing a UN mandate for action, as evident when Bush spoke in front of the UN General Assembly on 12 September 2002. In his speech to the General Assembly on 12 September 2002, Bush announced the conditions the Iraqi regime had to meet immediately. The President called for strong multilateral action against Iraq if it did not destroy the weapons and weapons programs that had been assumed to have been present in Iraq. Thus, Bush's speech triggered a crisis for Iraq by increasing the threat perception, war likelihood and time pressure for Saddam.  Following President Bush's speech to the UN, on 16 September, Iraq announced that it would accept the unconditional return of the UNMOVIC inspectors. After generally settling on the conditions by which the inspectors would return, the UN Security Council achieved a consensus and unanimously passed Resolution 1441 on 8 November. This resolution outlined the conditions under which weapons inspectors would return to Iraq and promised "the severest consequences" for noncompliance.  The weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq on 18 November. As part of the inspections agreement, Iraq was to provide a complete declaration of their weapons capabilities. Iraq produced the 12,000 page declaration on 7 December 2002. However, after the UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix announced that the arms declaration contained little new information since 1998, the U.S. declared Iraq to be in material breach of Resolution 1441 on 19 December. With the arms declaration's lack of satisfying information, President Bush perceived that there was a sufficient mandate to intervene. Over the next month, the Bush administration relied on Secretary of State Powell's diplomatic efforts to garner as much support as possible and perhaps find a peaceful solution. Not being satisfied with the progress on the diplomatic front, on 13 January Bush communicated his firm intention to go to war against Iraq to Powell, stating, “The inspections are not getting us there” (Woodward 2004: 270). The perception, by the Bush and Blair administrations, that diplomatic solutions to bring Iraq into compliance with Resolution 1441 had been exhausted triggered a crisis for the U.S. and the U.K.  Throughout January, the U.S. and U.K. continued deploying large-scale military forces in the Gulf in anticipation of a possible attack on Iraq, which created tensions within the UN Security Council. France and Germany were strongly against military action without a UN resolution. Blair, mainly due to domestic pressures, wanted to secure a second Security Council resolution authorizing a US-led attack on Iraq and persuaded the U.S. to seek a UN mandate. During much of February, the U.S., along with the U.K., engaged in diplomatic efforts to secure a second resolution but it became increasingly clear that these efforts were futile. France, Germany and Russia were firmly opposed to the use of force and proposed to give Iraq more time to disarm.  The UN weapons inspectors continued to work with Iraqi authorities during February. The progress reports of Hans Blix, head of UNMOVIC, were less critical of Iraqi cooperation than before. Although the inspectors found no weapons of mass destruction, Blix cautioned against jumping to a conclusion. France and Russia expressed satisfaction with the inspections regime and insisted on giving more time to Iraq to fully comply, based on Blix' progress reports about the increasing cooperation of Iraq with the inspectors as well as the progress in the destruction of al-Samoud missiles.  On 4 March, Powell declared that the U.S. was prepared to launch a war with or without a second resolution. By mid March, it was evident that a second resolution would fail to pass. The U.S., U.K. and Spain (which had been in favor of U.S.-led action) held an emergency meeting on 16 March, and at the end of the meeting they issued an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face attack.  The war on Iraq, named Operation Iraqi Freedom, was launched on 20 March. The first attack was apparently aimed at killing Saddam Hussein and decapitating his regime. The goals of the war were identified as disarming the country of its weapons of mass destruction, freeing the Iraqi people and deposing Saddam Hussein and his regime. The war took longer than the U.S. and U.K. had expected. Although they were technologically inferior, Iraqi irregular units employed guerilla tactics against the U.S. and U.K. forces. Despite the unanticipated resistance of Iraqi forces, especially the irregulars, by early April the regime of Saddam Hussein collapsed. The U.S.-led coalition forces seized Baghdad on 9 April, which symbolized the fall of the regime. The whereabouts of Saddam Hussein remained unclear but several of his close associates were taken into custody. Tikrit, which was the last city not under U.S. or U.K. control, fell on 14 April. On 1 May 2003, President Bush publicly announced from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln that major combat operations were over in Iraq. Since Iraq exited the system temporarily as a sovereign state, 1 May 2003 is considered as the end of the crisis for all crisis actors even though clashes with Hussein loyalists and other insurgents continued well afterward.  (Although the whole country was under effective U.S. control by the mid-April, lawlessness and sporadic fighting with pro-Saddam irregulars interfered with the U.S. efforts to begin reconstructing post-war Iraq. The biggest challenge for the U.S. was to maintain law and order while preparing the transition to self-rule in Iraq. As the months progressed, there was growing Iraqi dissatisfaction as well as resistance to the U.S. occupation. The U.S.-led coalition forces remained in Iraq to restore degraded infrastructure and facilitate the establishment of a freely elected government. Saddam Hussein's heir-apparent sons, Udai and Qusai Hussein, were killed in a gun battle on 22 July 2003, and Saddam himself was captured by U.S. forces on December 13, 2003. The U.S. transferred sovereignty to the Iraqi people in June 2004.  The invasion forces never found any stockpiles of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, or evidence that there had been recently a functional weapons program. After the war, rigorous reviews of the Iraq weapons programs prior to the war -- most notably the report compiled by Charles Duelfer, the Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction -- revealed that the Hussein regime lacked any stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and the capabilities to produce such weapons had progressively dwindled since the Gulf War.)
The North Korean Nuclear Crisis II began on 3 October 2002 and lasted till 6 January 2004. North Korea and the United States were the two main crisis actors. China, Japan, South Korea and Russia were also involved in the crisis. See also crisis #408. and Pre-Crisis  In 1994, United States confronted North Korea about its development of weapons grade plutonium as part of a previous crisis in the Korean peninsula protracted conflict (see case # 408). As part of the "Agreed Framework" finalized on 21 October 1994, the U.S. was to supply North Korea with light-water nuclear reactors (LWRs) (that could not be used to develop nuclear weapons) and ample heavy fuel oil for its energy requirements in the meantime. The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), a consortium of the U.S., South Korea, Japan and the EU, became principally responsible for providing the heavy oil and constructing the light-water reactors. In exchange, the North Korean government vowed to freeze its nuclear weapons program and halt the use of reactors that could produce weapons-grade material.  Eight years after the agreement, relations remained precarious between the U.S. and North Korea. A crisis erupted in 1996 (see case #420), diplomatic relations continued to be non-existent, the U.S. continued to refuse granting North Korea a non-aggression guarantee, the Bush administration labeled the North Koreans as part of an "axis of evil" in January 2002, and North Korea was included on a U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism. However, relations had gradually improved between DPRK and South Korea, with more and more support for normalization and reunification.  Over the course of the eight years following the 1994 agreement, KEDO also failed to expedite the construction of the promised light water nuclear reactors. The U.S. was also suspicious that the North Korean government would not uphold its end of the bargain, and intelligence revealed that the North Koreans had indeed resumed pursuit of nuclear weapons. At this time, the U.S. had begun mobilizing troops in the Middle East in anticipation of what would become in March 2003 a war for regime change in Iraq. This would severely limit the military options available to the U.S. vis-a-vis North Korea.  In a June 2002 assessment of the North Korean nuclear program, U.S. intelligence concluded that Pyongyang had begun a secret enrichment program. The CIA also publicly stated that North Korea was in the process of constructing a nuclear plant. The United States, however, did not react to this intelligence assessment immediately. It was only after the successful summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in September 2002 that the U.S. decided to intervene.  The North Korean situation came to a head on 3 October 2002, when U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly led a delegation to Pyongyang with the intention of confronting the North Korean government with information that the DPRK had obtained technology for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. When James Kelly confronted DPRK Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju, the verbal act triggered a crisis for North Korea. Although the DPRK is said to have initially denied the U.S. accusations, its admission the following day triggered a crisis for the United States. It justified its action in light of being branded as part of an "axis of evil" by the Bush administration although its secret weapons program was traced back to before 2001.  The crisis began to unfold soon after the October meeting. On 16 October, the United States made public that North Korea had "acknowledged" a secret enrichment program, a clear violation of the Agreed Framework. In response, Pyongyang accused the U.S. of breaching the Agreed Framework by not delivering the LWRs and failing to guarantee non-aggression. The United States lobbied for support for its stance from South Korea and Japan and soon after, managed to get KEDO to suspend further oil shipments to North Korea.  Pyongyang's response was initially verbal statements but the crisis escalated on 12 December. The DPRK publicly announced the end of the Agreed Framework and revealed that it intended to restart its nuclear program. Soon after, it wanted IAEA to remove its seals and cameras from all nuclear facilities. From 22 December, it restarted its plutonium production facilities and 5 days later it expelled the IAEA inspectors. After warning that that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in late December, North Korea made good on its threat on 10 January 2003.  The United States initially refused to engage directly with North Korea. President Bush wanted a "complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement" of DPRK's nuclear weapons program before negotiating with Pyongyang. It decided to put more pressure on DPRK by convening an IAEA meeting in mid-February that was expected to formally find North Korea in violation of the NPT treaty. As there was likelihood that this violation could be refereed to the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), North Korea asserted that that any UNSC sanctions would be considered an act of war.  In the following months, the U.S. realized that this approach would only lead to further escalation of the situation and adopted a more nuanced stance and pursued multilateral negotiations (that came to be called the Six-Party Talks) with North Korea by involving China, Japan and South Korea. At DPRK's request, Russia was also included in these talks. The first round of the six-party talks took place in late August 2003. Although there were no substantive concessions made by either side, they made headway on procedural issues. They agreed to find a resolution without resorting to violence and take North Korea security concerns into account, especially the final objective of having a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. They also agreed that dialogue should continue and avoid actions that may exacerbate the crisis. Given the antagonistic nature of the crisis actors, this "common understanding" was seen as a step in the right direction.  After the first round of the six-party talks, both North Korea and the United States adopted a relatively more conciliatory stance towards each other. The U.S. did not explicitly insist that North Korea dismantle its nuclear facilities before any substantive negotiations. It agreed to address some of North Korea's demands in what the State Department labeled a step-by-step approach. On its part, North Korea also softened its stance and publicly stated its intention to resolve the crisis through dialogue.  The crisis concluded when North Korea offered not to test or produce nuclear weapons on 6 January 2004, a statement that led to relatively calmer discussions in next few rounds of the six party talks. The immediate threat of war and time pressure to deal with the crisis decreased. By the time the second round of talks scheduled for February 2004 began, it seemed that both United States and North Korea were sincerely engaged to resolve the nuclear issue through negotiations.
In early 2003, the IAEA commenced inspections of Iran's nuclear installations amid suspicions that Iran was developing nuclear weapons. On 13 June 2003, the IAEA issued a report in Vienna. In it, the IAEA concluded that Iran had not met all of its obligations under the Safeguards Agreements. This report represented the beginning of the crisis for Iran and the EU3—the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Iran's major response to the IAEA report came on 16 June 2003 when Iran rejected EU and IAEA calls for it to accept surprise inspections. For Iran, the gravest threat faced during the crisis was a threat to its influence. If its nuclear ambitions were stopped, it risked losing important influence among both allies and adversaries in the region. Moreover, the acquisition of nuclear weapons would have the opposite effect. Furthermore, the presence of nuclear weapons in Iran would limit the United States' ability to interfere in Iranian affairs. Despite the fact that the U.S. was not a crisis actor, the U.S. remained the source of military threat for Iran. The EU3 would not commence military hostilities without the support of the U.S. Iran's negotiations with the IAEA and the EU3 were handled by the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. The Iranian President did issue statements throughout the crisis, but the primary communications were handled by Iran's negotiator.  The major response from the EU3 occurred on 14 June 2003. In a verbal statement, the EU3 urged Iran to allow surprise inspections to all sites. For the EU3, the crisis was a threat to Europe's influence. Internally, the EU3 wanted to secure their influence within the EU. Externally, the EU3 wanted to show that the EU is a relevant actor in foreign affairs. The foreign ministers of the UK, France, and Germany were primarily responsible for negotiations. As a regional organization, the EU's foreign policy chief was also involved in negotiations.  In addition to the four crisis actors, the United States, Russia, and Israel were involved in the crisis. Despite its importance in international relations, China was not sufficiently involved to be considered an involved actor. American involvement was a source of frustration for all parties. American condemnations and threats during this crisis were viewed extremely unfavourably by the Iranian government. The American hard-line positions and occasional impatience with the Europeans was a source of frustration for the EU3. However, the primary source of frustration for the EU3 was the lack of American involvement in the negotiating process. Russian involvement was viewed favourably by the four crisis actors. Russia took a conciliatory approach that helped to ease tensions.  The UN's involvement in the crisis came mainly from the IAEA. Although an IAEA report triggered the crisis, the IAEA helped to terminate the crisis through fact-finding and negotiations. It was therefore viewed favourably by the EU3 and Iran. However, the IAEA was willing to condemn Iranian actions when it was deemed appropriate.  Throughout the crisis, there were no instances of violence. Instead, negotiations were the primary crisis management technique for the four crisis actors. Negotiations between Iran and the EU3 began in October 2003. After more than a year of negotiations, Iran and the EU3 signed an agreement on 15 November 2004 in which Iran pledged to suspend nuclear enrichment. In return, Iran would not be taken before the UNSC and the Europeans would negotiate with Iran about future trade ties and civilian nuclear technology. This voluntary formal agreement concluded the crisis for all actors. The agreement was a compromise that satisfied all parties. The EU3 received an important pledge from Iran. Iran avoided being taken before the UNSC, had opened up positive bargaining space with the EU, and could easily withdraw from the agreement.
From 4 October to 2 December 2003, Israel and Syria were involved in another crisis within the Arab-Israeli protracted conflict. Israel and various Arab groups -- e.g., Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah -- that support the Palestinians and oppose Israeli statehood had frequently been in conflict. Israel suspects that the Arab groups had not only staged attacks from Palestinian-controlled areas, but they had also used neighboring countries to mobilize, train and plan attacks against Israel. Consequently, Israel frequently used air strikes against suspected Hezbollah positions in Lebanon since Israel pulled its troops out of Lebanon in 2000. While Israel lamented Syria's alleged direct and indirect support of terrorist groups, Israel had not attacked Syria in 21 years. A crisis for Israel was triggered on 4 October 2003 by a suicide bomb attack in Haifa that killed at least 21 people. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for this suicide attack on the eve of the Yom Kippur holiday in a crowded sea-side restaurant. On 5 October, Israeli fighter jets struck a suspected terrorist training camp near Damascus used by Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The Israeli air strike in Syrian territory, which coincided with the 30th anniversary of the 1973 war, triggered a crisis for Syria. While Israel claimed that the camp was used by terrorist organizations under Syrian patronage, Syria denied that the target was a training camp for Palestinian militants and claimed that it was a shelter for Palestinian refugees. Following the air strike, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon warned Syria that if it continues to protect terrorist organizations preparing anti-Israeli attacks, Israel could launch more air strikes.  Syria responded to the Israeli air attack immediately by lodging a complaint with the U.N. Security Council. After Syria's demand for an emergency meeting, 15 members of the Security Council met and considered the Syrian-drafted resolution accusing Israel of violating the U.N. Charter and international law. Although the Syrian ambassador called for an immediate vote on the draft, the emergency meeting ended without taking a vote or setting a date for the resumption of the meeting. On 6 October, Lebanon also lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council supporting Syria's position. Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri called on the international community to restrain Israel. The League of Arab States defined the air strike as "state terrorism" and released a statement demanding the U.N. to stop it. The role of the Arab League throughout the crisis was confined to criticizing and condemning the Israeli attack.  The European Union, as well as the governments of the U.K., France, Germany, and China condemned the Israeli air strike. The U.S., on the other hand, stood behind Israel. President Bush said that Israel had the right to defend itself in the face of terrorist attacks. Although Bush urged Sharon to avoid escalating tensions in the region, the U.S. called on Syria to stop harboring terrorists. Russia joined the international community in condemning the Israeli air strike but Moscow said that a U.N. resolution must also call for an end to attacks against Israel. The U.S. also said that it would veto any resolution that did not explicitly condemn Palestinian terrorism.  Israel and Syria exchanged rhetorical threats during October and November 2003 at a high diplomatic level. Israeli Prime Minister Sharon warned Syria that "Israel would strike in every place and with any means to defend its citizens," while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accused Israel of trying to "terrorize" Damascus and the Middle East.  Towards the end of November, Syria's rhetoric vis-a-vis Israel shifted to emphasize the importance of the Middle East peace process and the return of the Golan Heights, as well as the important role of the U.S. in the peace process. Thus, Syrian statements became relatively more constructive and less hostile at the end of November. The interview with Bashar al-Assad in The New York Times on 1 December 2003 demonstrated Syria's rather conciliatory approach. The next day, both Syrian and Israeli papers quoted from the interview in The New York Times and some high level Israeli officials described it as a positive step. Thus, 2 December 2003 marks the end of the crisis. In general, the crisis faded without a definitive outcome and mostly as a result of Syria's softening position toward both the U.S. and Israel.  The U.N. did not reach a conclusion on the Syrian-drafted resolution, and its role during the crisis consisted of discussion without resolution and bilateral talks between Kofi Annan and Syrian diplomats. The U.S. Congress voted on 8 October to approve the Syria Accountability Act, which demanded that Syria stop its support for terrorism and withdraw its troops from Lebanon; however, this event was separate from the unfolding crisis. The Accountability Act had been a result of long discussions between Congress and the White House which started long before the crisis between Israel and Syria took place. Although it demonstrated the hardening U.S. position against Syria, the passing of the act did not affect the crisis between Israel and Syria much.
From 1 June 2004 until 20 December 2004, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) engaged in a crisis stoked by the activity of insurgents in the eastern part of the DRC. The five-year DRC civil war, which also involved six other African nations - Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Chad, Zimbabwe and Namibia - terminated in 2002. Rwanda had intervened in that conflict primarily to defend itself against attack by Hutu militias in the DRC. The Tutsi-led government in Rwanda also held these militias accountable for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Despite withdrawing from the DRC, Rwanda still felt vulnerable to attacks by the militia groups and demanded that the perpetrators of the genocide be brought to justice. To stabilize the 2002 ceasefire, a UN monitoring group (MONUC) had been responsible for patrolling the border areas and facilitating disarmament.  In addition to Hutu militias, an opposition group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) vied for power in the eastern part of the DRC. The RCD had been supported by Rwanda and was represented in the Kinshasha transitional government. It comprised and defended the Banyamulenge people, who are Congolese Tutsis. On 1 June 2004, a group of renegade troops drawn from the RCD captured the Congolese town of Bukavu. Laurent Nkunda, one of the RCD generals, claimed that the action was taken to protect the Banyamulenge population and that they would withdraw if new military authorities were appointed. Despite Nkunda's denials, DRC president Joseph Kabila immediately accused Rwandan troops of being responsible for the fall of Bukavu. He also lambasted the MONUC troops -– authorized to only use force in self defense -- for allowing Bukavu to fall. The fall of Bukavu triggered a crisis for the DRC, which felt threatened both internally and externally. Kabila's accusations against Rwanda and call for "general mobilization" triggered a crisis for Rwanda. As a response to these accusations, Rwanda closed her border with the DRC. On 22 June, Kabila followed through and sent an estimated 10,000 troops to reinforce the eastern frontier.  Fearing the outbreak of full-scale war that could again drastically destabilize the region, the international community immediately expressed concern. Diplomats from the UN, African Union (AU), European Union (EU) and US called for both sides to show restraint. In an early effort to reduce the tensions, Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, chairman of the AU, held talks in Abuja between Kabila and Rwandan president Paul Kagame. Both sides agreed to adhere in the Pretoria agreement of July 2002 and to set up a verification team that would ensure the disarmament of Hutu militia groups and the absence of Rwandan troops on DRC soil.  While the June summit in Abuja pulled both sides back from the brink of war, both Rwanda and the DRC remained wary of the security situation. On 1 October, the UN Security Council voted to extend the mandate of MONUC and to increase the size of the force from 10,800 to 16,700 in response to continued concerns about hostilities in the DRC's eastern provinces.  Hostilities again escalated after Rwanda claimed that Hutu rebels in the DRC launched rocket attacks into Rwanda on 15 November. Kagame threatened to fully defend Rwanda and to send troops into the DRC if necessary. At the end of the month, the DRC accused Rwandan troops of entering into its territory and on 1 December asked the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Rwanda after UN observers confirmed the presence of Rwandan troops. Fighting continued in the eastern part of the DRC through mid-December.  Throughout December the international community, particularly the EU, urged Rwanda not to undertake unilateral military action and send its troops into the DRC in pursuit of Hutu militias. In response to the warnings of the international community, Rwanda called for both AU and EU intervention in the crisis and asked for their help to disarm the Hutu militias in the DRC. Finally, in mid-December the EU cooperation and development commissioner Louis Michael arranged a regional tour in Africa to calm the situation and to mediate between the DRC and Rwanda.  EU commissioner Louis Michel visited the DRC on 18 December and promised greater EU assistance in the DRC transition process. On 19 December, he visited Rwanda and urged Kagame to show restraint in the DRC crisis. On 20 December, Rwanda withdrew its threat to invade the DRC, asserting that the international community has assured that the militia groups in the DRC would be disarmed. The unilateral withdraw terminated the crisis for both countries.  Although the crisis was over by December 20 with the cessation of military threat, the international community continued to mediate between Rwanda and the DRC to resolve the conflict permanently by disarming Hutu militias. At the two-day AU summit in January 2005, AU's Peace and Security Council discussed the conflict between Rwanda and the DRC and urged for the disarmament of Hutu militias. The AU also decided to send troops to the region in order to help the DRC disarm the Hutu rebels. At the end of January, the US also intervened in the conflict and invited the foreign ministers of Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC to Washington. The negotiations that took place in Washington were also helpful in increasing the cooperation and trust among the parties. As a result of these mediations and negotiations, the Rwanda-DRC Joint Border Verification Mechanisms was launched on 8 February 2005. The joint efforts of Rwanda and the DRC to monitor the border and to disarm rebels proved effective. On 31 March 2005, DRC-based rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda comprised of extremist Hutu militias announced that they was disarming and abandoning their armed struggle against Rwanda.
From 10 June 2004 to 5 November 2004, Georgia and Russia experienced a crisis as a result of the separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Since its independence, Georgia has struggled to stabilize the three major separatist movements within its territory; Adzharia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Early in 2004, Georgia faced unrest in Adzharia but was able to restore order. Talks scheduled between Georgia and South Ossetia on 1 June 2004 were canceled after the two sides failed to reach an agreement. This led Georgia to send hundreds of troops to the South Ossetian border. The deployment of Georgian forces was condemned by the president of South Ossetia as well as Russia, which saw the Russian population in South Ossetia as an excuse to intervene in the conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia. The attempts of the self-proclaimed republic of South Ossetia to seek Russia's recognition of its independence increased the tension between Georgia and Russia. The arrival of South Ossetian president, Eduard Kokoyty, in Moscow to submit an official appeal to the Russian president and the federal assembly for the accession of the republic to Russia triggered a crisis for Georgia on 10 June 2004. Although the trigger of the crisis was from an internal actor within Georgia, the close relationship between South Ossetia and Russia turned the situation into a foreign policy crisis for Georgia with Russia.  In the following weeks, Russia accused Georgia of violating the existing agreements between Georgia and South Ossetia by deploying troops to the border and escalating the conflict by setting up checkpoints in the border zone. In the first week of July, Georgian forces detained several Russia peacekeepers in South Ossetia. Clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces also occurred in the following days. In mid-July, the tension between Georgia and Russia increased when Georgian president Saakashvili accused Russia of stirring up ethnic clashes, and warned Russia that the conflict with South Ossetia would not be an internal conflict but an international conflict between Georgia and Russia.  The situation became more complicated at the beginning of August when Georgia complained about the increase in military preparations in Abkhazia and accused Russia of supporting the separatists there. On 3 August, Georgia threatened to open fire on Russian ships that enter the Black Sea waters of the Abkhazian region. While this threat was the major response of Georgia after the crisis started, it also triggered a crisis for Russia. The next day, Russia replied to this threat by implying that it could resort to military action in response to the Georgian threat.  At the beginning of September, the siege of a school by Chechen rebels located in southern Russia increased the vulnerability of the country to problems related to separatist threats. Moreover, the hostage crisis Russia experienced occurred in North Ossetia which is contiguous to South Ossetia that lies within Georgian territory.  In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 21 September, Saakashvili argued that his country is committed to resolving the conflicts in its breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by peaceful means and he outlined a three-stage peace plan for conflict resolution. During the speech, the president also hinted at Russia's role in escalating the conflicts in those two regions. The General Assembly did not take any direct action towards the resolution of the crisis. Thus, the UN did not play a significant role in resolving the conflict between Georgia and Russia or in terminating the crisis.  The role of the United States in this crisis was also limited. During his visit in the US at the beginning of August, the Georgian president met with several high ranking officials, including Secretary of State Powell and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and discussed the situation in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. However, the involvement of the US was limited to political and verbal support of Georgia.  A demilitarization agreement between Georgia and South Ossetia on 5 November and Russia's presence in these negotiations marked the termination of this fading crisis between Georgia and Russia.
A crisis occurred between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 4 October 2005 to 11 January 2006 as a result of Eritrea’s restriction of UN peacekeepers along the disputed border between the two countries. The crisis faded after both sides reduced their high concentrations of troops along the border in mid-January. Since the 1998-2000 border war (see Case #424), the relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have remained tense. The Algiers Agreement signed at the end of the war created a demilitarized 25km Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) within Eritrean territory to be monitored by UN peacekeepers. In 2002, the independent boundary commission awarded the disputed town of Badme to Eritrea. However, Ethiopia has been obstructing the implementation of the decision since 2002. Eritrea considers the continued presence of Ethiopian troops in the disputed territory to be a violation of its sovereignty and resents the UN for not pressuring Ethiopia to accept the final decision. Each country has accused the other of hostile intentions and maintained volatile relations with the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). Since December 2004, Ethiopia has constantly increased its troop levels along the border with Eritrea, resulting in a further deterioration of relations between the two countries. Frustrated by the reluctance of the UN to pressure Ethiopia to accept the border ruling, Eritrea banned all helicopter flights by the UN peacekeepers in Eritrean airspace on 4 October 2005. This decision restricted the operational ability of the UN mission to check Eritrea’s military movements along the border and triggered a crisis for Ethiopia. Following the ban on helicopter flights, Eritrea also restricted UN ground patrols which decreased the operational ability of the UN even further. On 19 October 2005, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of boosting military activity along the border by increasing the number of soldiers on the Eritrean side. Ethiopia’s accusation triggered a crisis for Eritrea and increased the likelihood of a violent conflict between the two countries.  Immediately after Ethiopia’s accusations, Eritrea started to re-position troops and armaments along the border. Ethiopia responded in kind and moved more soldiers and military hardware to the border. The growing tension around the TSZ and the exchange of accusations at a high official level between the two countries raised the risk of a new war according to UN officials. At the beginning of November, the UN Secretary General and the head of the AU Commission Konare urged restraint and called on both sides to halt military actions that may be misinterpreted by the other side. These appeals were ignored by both countries. While Ethiopia defended its troop deployments along the border, Eritrea denied massing troops along the TSZ. The UN Security Council decided to send Japanese envoy Oshima on a fact-finding tour of the region. Oshima arrived in the Ethiopian capital on November 7 for talks with both Ethiopia and Eritrea to defuse the escalating tension. Oshima was unable to meet with Eritrean officials, but he received assurances that Ethiopia would not be the first to fire in the event of a border conflict. However, Ethiopia continued to object the boundary commission’s ruling on Badme. Eritrea, on the other hand, insisted that it is the UN’s responsibility to pressure Ethiopia into abiding by the boundary commission’s decision.  On November 23, the UN Security Council passed a resolution which threatened sanctions against both countries if either used force to settle their border dispute or if Eritrea failed to lift restrictions on the movements of UN peacekeepers. The resolution demanded that both parties return to the 16 December 2004 levels of deployment. Two days later, at a UN-hosted meeting in Nairobi chaired by the commander of the UNMEE, senior military officers from Ethiopia and Eritrea exchanged accusations and gave no hint that they would comply with the UN Security Council demands. However, a week later Ethiopia indicated that it might be willing to comply with the UN resolution. Eritrea, on the other hand, did not indicate any willingness to cooperate.  On December 7, Eritrea demanded the immediate withdrawal from its territory of nationals of the US, Canada, Russia and the EU countries serving with the UNMEE. The UN refused to comply with Eritrea’s decision to expel part of the UN mission. Following this incident, UN Secretary-General Annan sent two senior UN officials to Eritrea and Ethiopia in order to reduce the tension between the two sides and to assess the impact of Eritrea’s decision to expel part of UN monitoring forces. The UN undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, Guehenno, and his adviser Kumar arrived in Ethiopia on December 11. They met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Zenawi and warned that a minor misunderstanding could escalate into an open conflict. As a result of this trip, on December 13, Ethiopia agreed to redeploy its forces on the border with Eritrea to positions they held before December 2004. The Eritrean side did not agree to meet with the UN Secretary General envoy. After Eritrea’s refusal to meet Guehenno, the UN agreed to the temporary evacuation of 180 UNMEE staff.  Minor clashes between Ethiopian and Eritrean forces took place sporadically along the disputed border throughout the entirety of the crisis. The clashes declined after Ethiopia started to move some troops back from the border on December 23. At the beginning of January, both sides reduced their troops along the border. On January 11, UNMEE described these developments as positive and reported that the tension along the border had drastically decreased. However, Eritrea’s restrictions on UN helicopter flights and movement of UN peacekeepers remained in place. Although the crisis faded by mid-January, the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea was not resolved. There was no definitive outcome to the crisis and the two countries continued to have volatile relations throughout 2006.  The role of the US was limited during the crisis. In early November 2005, US Undersecretary of State for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, contacted Ethiopian Prime Minister Zenawi to discuss the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Later that month, Donald Yamamoto, the US deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs, traveled to Addis Ababa to meet with Ethiopian officials and attempt to cool the rising border tensions. These US efforts were ignored by Eritrea and widely considered to be ineffective in helping to terminate the crisis.  Both the involvement of the UN Secretary General and the Security Council contributed to the termination of the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea. While the threat of sanctions by the Security Council affected the behavior of crisis actors to some extent, it was mainly the activities of the UN undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, Guehenno, which led to a rapid termination of the crisis. Although the mediation offer of the undersecretary-general was not accepted by Eritrea, Guehenno’s talks with the Ethiopian side convinced Ethiopian officials to accept the Security Council’s demands. As a result of these negotiations, Ethiopia pulled back its troops and Eritrea responded in kind terminating the crisis.
From 18 December 2005 until 8 February 2006, Chad and Sudan experienced a crisis as a result of the presence and activities of rebel groups from both sides hosted in each other’s territories. Relations between Chad and Sudan have been strained since late 2004. Chad’s government has been accusing Sudan of hosting and backing Chadian rebels who want to overthrow Chadian President Deby. While denying Chad’s accusations, Sudan has also been charging Chad for supporting Darfur rebels. As a result of these tensions, in mid-2005, Chad has suspended the mediation of the Darfur conflict and the relations between the two countries have continued to deteriorate. On 18 December 2005, Chadian rebels attacked Chadian troops in the town of Adre, close to the border with Sudan. This incident triggered a crisis for Chad, who blamed Sudan for the rebel raid. The rebel raid continued the following day. Chadian troops killed approximately 300 rebels and forced the rest into their camps in Sudan. After Chad’s accusations, the Sudanese government immediately denied supporting Chadian rebel groups and intervening in the domestic affairs of Chad. Despite Sudan’s declaration of its commitment to the policy of “good neighborhood” with Chad, on December 23 the government of Chad announced that a “state of war” existed between the two countries. Chad’s declaration of a “state of belligerence” against Sudan triggered a crisis for Sudanese government. In late December, the Chadian government demanded that Sudan drive away and disarm Chadian rebels from the joint border. Despite Sudanese protests to the contrary, Chad continued to accuse Sudan of supporting the rebels with money, bases, and arms. Sudan’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs described the accusations as nonsense and accused President Deby of trying to draw attention away from domestic problems.  On December 28, Chadian President Deby made a formal protest about Sudanese “aggression” to Nigerian president and African Union chairman Obasanjo. Simultaneously, the Sudanese government also complained to President Obasanjo that the government of Chad was sponsoring rebel groups in Sudan to wage war against Khartoum. As a result of these complaints, President Obasanjo set up an AU Commission of inquiry to study the claims of both countries and to report its findings at a mini-summit.  The first direct accusation by a Sudanese government official against President Deby following Chadian escalation of rhetoric came on 5 January 2006. The Sudanese Presidential Advisor and Communications Secretary announced that some Chadian government officials and army leaders supported rebels in Darfur and provided arms to the rebel movements.  Relations between the two countries deteriorated further the next day, January 6, when Chad accused Sudanese militias of carrying out several attacks in eastern Chad, which resulted in the deaths of several civilians. The Chadian government issued a new plea to the African Union to support Chad in the face of Sudanese aggression.  An attempt to mediate the conflict was launched by the Organization of the Islamic Conference in late January. The OIC claimed to have dispatched an envoy to defuse the crisis between Chad and Sudan, though the attempt to diffuse the crisis was largely unsuccessful.  Neither the United States nor the United Nations had any role in mediating the crisis, focusing instead on the human rights violations occurring in Darfur, though the UN reportedly scaled back its presence in parts of Sudan’s Darfur region bordering Chad because of the tension between the two nations. Chad and Sudan viewed this lack of intervention neutrally, and continued to accuse one another of various attacks and rebel support for several weeks.  In February it was announced that African leaders would attempt to calm the mounting border tensions between Chad and Sudan at a mini-summit in Libya. Both Chad and Sudan expressed a willingness to find a mechanism to end the conflict. The summit, hosted by the African Union, took place in Tripoli on 8 February 2006. There, Chad and Sudan signed a peace deal which banned the use of each other’s territory for hostile activity directed against the other, and prohibited each country from accepting rebels from the other. The treaty was welcomed by both presidents and effectively ended the crisis.
On 10 January 2006, Iran removed the UN seals from its nuclear reactors. This event marked the beginning of the second Iranian nuclear crisis. This event led to a foreign policy crisis for the U.S., the UK, and France. Between the end of the first Iranian nuclear crisis and the beginning of the second nuclear crisis, tensions and conflict continued. However, it was only with the removal of the seals that the threat of war rose sufficiently for the situation to be considered a crisis. On 11 January 2006, the U.S. issued a statement condemning Iran's actions and threatening UNSC action. This statement caused a foreign policy crisis for Iran. Throughout the crisis, there were no instances of violence. Instead, negotiations and sanctions were the primary crisis management techniques for the four crisis actors. Once again, the EU3 and Iran were the primary parties involved in negotiations. Multiple rounds of EU-Iran, Russian-Iran, and IAEA-Iran negotiations took place. Iran's major response came on 13 January 2006. Iran threatened to end cooperation with the IAEA if Iran was taken before the UNSC. For Iran, the gravest threat faced during the crisis was a threat to its influence. If its nuclear ambitions were stopped, it risked losing important influence among both allies and adversaries in the region. Moreover, the acquisition of nuclear weapons would have the opposite effect. Moreover, the presence of nuclear weapons in Iran would limit the United State's ability to interfere in Iranian affairs. Iran's negotiations with the IAEA and the EU3 were handled by the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. The Iranian President did issue statements throughout the crisis, but the primary communications were handled through negotiations. Iran's stance was much more hard-line early in this crisis. On 3 April 2006, Iran engaged in military manoeuvres. On 11 April 2006, Iran claims to have joined the nuclear club. As the crisis continued Iran relied more on negotiations. On 22 August 2007, Iran and the IAEA reached an agreement. However, this agreement did not significantly reduce tensions among the crisis actors.  On 12 Jan 2006, the EU3 called for UNSC action. This served as Britain's and France's major response. For Britain and France, the crisis was a threat to Europe's influence. Internally, they wanted to secure their influence within the EU. Externally, they wished to show that the EU is a relevant actor in foreign affairs. The foreign ministers of the UK, France, and Germany were primarily responsible for negotiations. As a regional organization, the EU's foreign policy chief was also involved in negotiations. During this crisis, Germany was only considered to be an involved actor. First, many important events in this crisis took place in the UNSC; a body in which Germany is not a permanent member. Second, German statements did not reflect the increased tensions to the same degree as those of the UK and France. At some point during the crisis, both Britain and France suggested that military force may be needed.  The U.S.'s statement of 11 January 2006 served as the American major response. For the U.S., the gravest threat faced was a threat to its superpower influence. If Iran acquired nuclear weapons, the U.S. would lose much of its ability to interfere in Iran. Moreover, it would also lose influence among allies, client states, and adversaries in the strategically important Middle East. Given that the U.S. did not participate in most of the direct negotiations with Iran, the U.S.'s representative to the UN was the primary actor with communication responsibilities. Of all of the Western crisis actors, the U.S. took the hardest line with Iran. While there was a consensus at the UN that sanctions were required, the U.S. pushed for harsher and more frequent sanctions.  In addition to the four crisis actors, Germany, Russia, China, and Israel were involved actors. Russian activity was generally viewed favourably by all actors. However, Russia also displeased all actors. The Americans and Europeans viewed Russian support for sanctions favourably. However, the U.S. was frustrated by Russia's refusal to end nuclear cooperation with Iran. For Iran, despite the fact that Russia's stance was much less favourable during this crisis, Russia was still a conciliatory force. However, Iran did not view Russian support for sanctions favourably. With the involvement of the UNSC, China became an involved actor. Much like Russia, China took a middle ground position. Finally, Israel's tone became much more threatening during this crisis. However, most of its threats and statements appear to have been aimed at influencing the U.S. instead of Iran.  The UNSC and IAEA were heavily involved in this crisis. The IAEA provided information, served as a negotiator, and condemned some Iranian actions. The UNSC's first statement on the issue occurred on 29 March 2006 when it gave Iran 30 days to suspend enrichment. On 31 July 2006, the UNSC passed a resolution that would allow for tough sanctions if nuclear activities were not stopped within a month. Finally, on 24 March 2007, the UNSC imposed sanctions on Iran.  The crisis ended on 4 December 2007 when the U.S. released an intelligence report that stated that Iran was not seeking to produce nuclear weapons. This report altered the governmental policies of the U.S., the UK, and France and removed a major threat to Iran. All parties were satisfied with the outcome of the crisis. For Iran, a major threat was removed. For the Americans and Europeans, the threat of an Iranian bomb was greatly decreased. The report caused a policy shift to occur in the U.S.
Chad experienced a one-actor crisis from 12 April 2006 to 8 August 2006 after Chadian rebels, allegedly backed by Sudan, launched an attack on its capital, Ndjamena. Since 2004, Chad and Sudan have had tense relations. Chad has accused Sudan of hosting and backing Chadian rebels while Sudan has blamed Chad for supporting Darfur rebels. A crisis erupted between the two countries in 2005, which ended with the signing of the Tripoli agreement in February 2006. Though the treaty prohibited the use of each other's territory for hostile activity directed against its neighbor, both countries continued to accuse each other for violating the agreement. In early April 2006, Chadian rebel organization United Front for Change (FUC) increased its attacks in eastern parts of the country. On April 12 the threat to the stability of the government became severe when the rebels launched a dawn raid on the Chadian capital Ndjamena. Though the raid was quickly quelled by government troops, the attack triggered a crisis for Chad. Chadian President Deby accused Sudan of backing the FUC attack on Ndjamena in an attempt to overthrow him and destabilize Chad. In response to this perceived threat from its neighbor, Chad cut off diplomatic ties with Sudan on April 14 and ordered Sudanese diplomats to leave the country. Chad also closed its border with Sudan on the same day. Sudan denied Chad's accusations immediately and affirmed its commitment to the Tripoli agreement. Although Sudan was clearly an involved actor in the conflict, it never experienced a crisis because Chad's political actions against Sudan did not pose a military threat. Chad was the only actor experiencing a crisis since Sudan did not perceive any military threat coming from its neighbor.  The international community reacted to the FUC attack on the Chadian capital immediately. The UN, which had withdrawn its staff from Chad's capital as the rebel attack intensified, condemned the rebel offensive. The Security Council urged both countries to uphold the provisions set forth in the Tripoli agreement. The African Union also condemned the FUC attack and called for a dialogue to end the dispute. In order to investigate Chad's accusations, the AU sent a fact-finding mission to the region at the end of April. The United States made statements calling for an end to the violence in the region and expressed its concerns over Chad's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Khartoum. However a week after the FUC attack the U.S. suggested that Sudan could be involved in the rebel offensive, but Washington stopped short of officially endorsing Chad's allegations against Sudan.  Having been involved in the mediation between Chad and Sudan which led to the signing of Tripoli agreement, Libya contacted both sides as soon as the crisis started for Chad. On April 16, Libyan foreign minister made a brief visit to Chad and a Libyan envoy met with the Sudanese President on April 17. Libya's initial efforts to ease the tension between Chad and Sudan turned out to be fruitless as Chad continued to accuse Sudan of backing the FUC and violating the Tripoli agreement. Sudan, in the mean time, maintained that Chad was experiencing a domestic rebellion for which Sudan should not be held responsible. In response to President Deby's accusations, Sudanese government blamed Chad for supporting Darfur rebel factions and undermining the peace process with the rebels in Sudan. During the month of May, Libyan leader Al-Qadhafi and his envoys continued their mediation efforts to improve the relations between the two neighbors.  In early June, the AU fact-finding mission concluded that Chad's accusations could not be confirmed. As President Deby became more discontent with the AU's involvement, Chad further accused Sudan of trying to destabilize the entire region, using Darfur as a base of rebel operations. Chad briefly threatened to expel Sudanese refugees who had sought refuge from the war-torn Darfur region, though Deby quickly backed off on this threat as a result of international pressure.  Throughout June, Sudan looked for ways of reconciliation with Chad. Sudanese Foreign Minister asked France for help in mending its relations with Chad. The UN and the AU also continued to put pressure on both sides to normalize their relations and abide by the Tripoli Agreement. During the seventh AU Summit in Gambia, Libyan President arranged a tripartite meeting with Sudan and Chad on July 2-3. At the end of the meeting, President Al-Bashir of Sudan and President Deby of Chad agreed to set up a joint committee for normalizing their relations and reaffirmed their commitment to the Tripoli Agreement. As a follow up to this meeting, Chadian foreign minister went to Khartoum for several days in mid-July and met with the Sudanese government to discuss political and security matters as well as the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations.  The meeting between Chad and Sudan in Gambia arranged by Libya was not the only development that came out of the AU Summit in early July. During the summit, the AU charged Senegal with mediating a full peace accord between Chad and Sudan as soon as possible. In mid-July the Senegalese President announced his desire to bring Chad and Sudan together for peace talks. He paid short visits to both countries to arrange this meeting. As a result, a mini-summit between Chad and Sudan was scheduled to take place on 9 August in the Senegalese capital, Dakar.  Although Senegal was charged with mediation by the AU, Libya's mediation efforts since the beginning of the crisis turned out to be much more effective. After the Chadian foreign minister's visit to Sudan in mid-July, which was an outcome of the Libyan initiative during the AU Summit, the two countries continued their negotiations that led to a peace deal. On 26 July 2006, Chad and Sudan signed a peace deal agreeing to take steps to normalize their relations. The agreement called for a joint military commission to monitor the border and forbade the presence of rebel elements in both countries. The peace deal repeated much of the text from the Tripoli agreement. Though it was a step in the right direction, the peace deal left the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries to the appreciation of the two heads of state who were not present at the signing of the agreement.  The presidents of Chad and Sudan were supposed to meet on August 9 in Dakar to finalize their commitment to the agreement and to restore the diplomatic relations between the countries. However, Libya found a window of opportunity before that date to arrange a reconciliatory meeting between the two heads of state. On August 8, many African leaders, including the President of Sudan, were present in Ndjamena to attend President Deby's inauguration ceremony after his re-election as president. Libyan leader Al-Qadhafi persuaded Sudanese and Chadian Presidents to hold an impromptu mini-summit after the inauguration ceremony. The mini-summit was also attended by the head of the AU, and the leaders of the Republic of Congo and Gabon. At the end of this impromptu mini-summit, Chad and Sudan agreed to put a definitive end to their differences and immediately restore diplomatic ties by reopening their common border and respective embassies. These decisions were also confirmed in an official statement issued by Chad after the summit. As a result of this development, the Dakar meeting did not take place on August 9 because Chadian and Sudanese officials decided that it was no longer necessary. The mini-summit organized by Libya officially marked the end of the crisis for Chad on 8 August 2006.
The North Korean Nuclear Crisis III began on 5 May 2006 and lasted till 3 October 2007. North Korea and the United States were the two main crisis actors. China, Japan, South Korea and Russia were also involved in the crisis. See also crises #408 and 441. The first three rounds of the Six Party Talks indicated that both North Korea and United States were willing to peacefully resolve the nuclear dispute. These talks, however, yielded more procedural gains than substantive benefits. The fourth round of talks that began on 25 July 2005 showed more flexibility on the part of the United States. Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill was given the green light to conduct direct bilateral negotiations with North Korea. Despite this, both sides could not agree on core substantial issues. Frustrated with the lack of progress, the United States decided to terminate the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO), the consortium that was set up after the North Korean Nuclear Crisis I (see case #408) and was intended to provide North Korea with heavy oil and construct light water reactors (KEDO had suspended its operations in North Korea during the North Korean Nuclear Crisis II (case # 441).  Washington also decided to put financial pressure on North Korea. In September 2005, the Macao-based Banco Delta Asia (BDA) was instructed to freeze North Korean assets and stop its dealings with Pyongyang or risk losing access to U.S. financial markets. The United States announced that its action was just the result of a routine laundering and counterfeiting investigation. In response, North Korea refused to return to the negotiation table till such time this issue was cleared up. It claimed that about $25 million of its assets were frozen at BDA. The fifth round of the Six Party Talks in November 2005 made no progress as this financial freeze overshadowed the nuclear issue. At this point, the negotiations seemed to largely fizzle out and end in a stalemate. On 5 May 2006, however, the United States obtained intelligence that North Korea was transporting a missile to a launch site. This information triggered a crisis for the United States. A few days after, North Korea announced that it intended to carry out a missile test. United States denounced DPRK's decision and began to explore ways to restart the stalled Six Party Talks. It did not, however, budge on removing its sanctions against financial institutions that do business with Pyongyang. In an effort to pressure North Korea against conducting a missile test, KEDO officially terminated its light water reactor project in North Korea in early June. When Pyongyang, however, invited the United States for talks to resolve the nuclear issue, these overtures were rebuffed and the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea warned the DPRK that it would face repercussions if it went ahead with the missile test.  Meanwhile, many other countries also spotted a North Korean rocket on a launch pad and intelligence information about possible fuelling work surfaced around mid-June. While Japan sided with the United States on sanctioning DPRK further, South Korea and China called for the resumption of the Six Party Talks. At the same time, United States attempted to get China to dissuade North Korea; China urged North Korea not to a launch a long-range missile but Pyongyang ignored the Chinese request and upped the ante declaring that it would respond to a U.S. military strike with nuclear war. Towards the end of June, there was a flurry of diplomatic activity to reduce tension in the peninsula but on 5 July 2006 DPRK test-fired its Taepodong II long-range missile as well as six other medium and short-range missiles. Although the test failed, it was a clear indication that the North Korea still possessed offensive capabilities.  In response to the missile test, Japan requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and called for sanctions against North Korea. In a unanimous vote on 15 July 2006, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1695 which demanded that the DPRK halt all nuclear activity and unconditionally return to the negotiation table. It also called on other member countries to take efforts to stop the transfer of nuclear material and related technology to North Korea. At the same time, it noted that negotiations were the most appropriate way to resolve the crisis. This undivided Security Council vote triggered the crisis for North Korea; it immediately rejected the U.N. resolution and claimed that its missile test was a sovereign act intended to protect itself from an external threat.  After its missile test, North Korea faced increasing isolation from the international community. Humanitarian assistance from South Korea was suspended and some countries (Australia, Vietnam, Mongolia, Singapore and China) also froze North Korean assets following U.N. resolution 1695. On 3 October 2006, North Korea escalated the crisis through an announcement that it intended to conduct a nuclear weapons test. Despite international pressure, DPRK North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on 9 October 2006. Both the United States and South Korea confirmed DPRK's test after radioactive debris was detected in air samples around the site.  In response to the nuclear test, the United States and Japan championed U.N. resolution 1718 that called on DPRK not to escalate the situation by conducting more nuclear tests, and dismantle its missile program in a "complete, verifiable and irreversible manner". In addition, it wanted member states to prevent any sale of nuclear related material to Pyongyang and also step up inspection of North Korean shipping vessels at their ports. The Security Council unanimously adopted this resolution, and is seen as one of the strongest sanctions against Pyongyang. However, both China and Russia pushed for the inclusion of a clause that would prevent the implementation of the resolution with military force. The Security Council also formed a committee to monitor the actions of member states in implementing the tenets of the resolution. Notably, the resolution was passed after only six days of discussion (compared to the usual eleven), an indication that the defiance of North Korea in the face of international pressure made it easier for the Security Council members to agree on the text of the resolution.  About three weeks after North Korea conducted its nuclear test, it agreed to return to the Six Party Talks. Meanwhile, the United States, Japan and South Korean negotiators also met to form a consensus on how to negotiate with Pyongyang. Over the next few months, North Korea maintained that the release of its assets at BDA was a precondition to further negotiations. Bogged down in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States changed course and agreed to release on Pyongyang's assets at BDA; it also allowed North Korea to sell arms to Ethiopia in January 2007.  A breakthrough in negotiations was achieved on 13 February 2007. North Korea consented to the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor and agreed to permit IAEA inspectors to monitor the site within 60 days. In turn, the United States agreed to provide DPRK with 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, and also release North Korean assets at BDA within 30 days. There was also an agreement to discuss issues of denuclearization of the peninsula, normalization of relations between North Korea and the United States, and North Korea and Japan. This agreement reflected a change in Washington's policy towards DPRK. Through December 2006 and January 2007, United States and North Korean officials met directly and held bilateral negotiations. These efforts laid the foundation to the February agreement at the Six Party Talks.  The implementation of the February agreement proceeded smoothly with two key exceptions. The United States faced hurdles in releasing the $25 million held in Macau, and the North Korea-Japanese talks failed to make any progress. In the former case, an intermediary was required as Daedong Credit Bank, the largest BDA account holder, refused to directly release the funds to Pyongyang. This proved difficult since no bank wanted to receive the North Korean assets. It was only in June 2007 that Pyongyang received the funds that were frozen at BDA via a Russian bank. Soon after, North Korea then announced that it would implement its part of the February agreement.  On 12 July 2007, North Korea shutdown the Yongbyon reactor and the IAEA issued a statement acknowledging Pyongyang's cooperation. In response, North Korea received 50,000 tons of fuel oil from South Korea. Meanwhile negotiators worked to achieve further progress in the nuclear talks. The Six Party Talks resumed in early August focusing on the dismantling of DPRK's nuclear weapons program. A team of U.S. experts also visited North Korea to survey their nuclear facilities and discuss the disabling of the Yongbyon reactor.  On 3 October 2007, the Six Party Talks sealed the second phase of the agreement on the nuclear issue with North Korea. Pyongyang agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities and also declare its nuclear programs by the end of the year. In return, the United States also pledged to remove DPRK from the list of countries that support terrorism. This agreement marked the end of the third nuclear crisis between the United States and North Korea.
A crisis occurred between Israel and Lebanon from 12 July 2006 to 8 September 2006 after Hezbollah guerillas crossed the Lebanese border into Israel and took two Israeli soldiers hostage, leading to a full-scale war. Relations between Israel and Lebanon have been extremely tense for decades, resulting in multiple cross-border clashes on both sides of the UN designated border, despite the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The incidents increased in early 2006, most notably in May when the Israeli air force attacked Palestinian bases deep within Lebanon after cross-border fighting erupted when militants fired rockets into northern Israel. The attack placed additional strain on Israeli/Lebanese relations. On 12 July 2006 Hezbollah guerillas crossed the Lebanese border into Israel and attacked an Israeli army patrol near Shtula killing three Israeli soldiers and taking two others as hostages. Hezbollah also launched rocket attacks at several Israeli villages and army posts at the same time. This attack immediately triggered a crisis for Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert described the Hezbollah attack as "an act war" and warned that Lebanon would bear the consequences of Hezbollah's actions. Following this threat, Israel imposed an air and sea blockade on Lebanon. That same day, Israel also launched a massive assault on southern Lebanon (Operation Just Deserts) by land, air, and from navy gunboats, triggering a crisis for Lebanon.  The Secretary General of the Hezbollah movement, Shaikh Hassan Nasrallah, stated that the seizure of the Israeli soldiers was designed to draw international attention to the plight of Lebanese, Palestinian, and Arab prisoners held in Israeli prisons. Meanwhile, the Lebanese government held an emergency Cabinet meeting, where they denied responsibility for the escalation of violence on the border with Israel and called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council.  Israel continued its assault over the next few days, conducting air raids over Lebanon and killing dozens of people, including a significant amount of civilians. In return, Hezbollah declared open war and fired rockets into Israel, killing several soldiers. On 16 July a fierce rocket attack on Haifa which killed eight Israeli civilians and wounded many others prompted a psychological escalation of the conflict. Israel stepped up its assault and continued to carry out air raids. Thousands of Lebanese citizens evacuated the country.  The war drew a great deal of international attention and calls for a ceasefire. The actions of both sides were condemned by many countries and organizations, including the United Nations. On 18 July, the UN sent a delegation to Israel in an attempt to broker a ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also visited Lebanon and Israel, attempting to establish a ceasefire and offering humanitarian aid. However, the mediation attempt by Rice turned out to be ineffective as her proposals were rejected by both sides. On 26 July representatives from the U.S., the UN, the EU, the World Bank, and several other countries attended an international crisis meeting in Rome. The Rome conference expressed a determination to work immediately to reach a ceasefire and called on the UN to authorize an international force to support UNIFIL and help stabilize the area. The League of Arab States also condemned the actions of Israel and urged the UN to protect Lebanon.  Despite the international pressure for a ceasefire, the fighting continued to escalate. On 27 July Israel's Security Cabinet approved call-ups for 30,000 reservist troops and continued the aerial bombardment and ground assault. The next day, Hezbollah unleashed powerful new rockets, hitting multiple targets deep within Israel. On 30 July an Israeli attack on Qana resulted in the deaths almost 60 civilians, 37 of them children, which provoked an international outcry. Israel apologized for the deaths and agreed to suspend its aerial bombardment for 2 days to allow for an investigation into the attacks; however, their bombardment of southern Lebanon continued the next day.  The violence continued into August, with aerial bombardments and rocket attacks continuing on both sides of the border. The Israeli offensive continued to deal devastating blows to Hezbollah. Prime Minister Olmert claimed that Hezbollah's infrastructure had been destroyed. Despite this claim, Hezbollah managed to fire more that 200 rockets into Israel on 2 August. On 8 August the Israeli Security Cabinet voted to approve the Chief of Staff's proposal for a major escalation of the conflict, authorizing the army to advance still further into Lebanese territory.  Throughout this time, the UN Security Council was working tirelessly to pass a resolution ordering a ceasefire in the area. Several drafts were rejected by Israel and Lebanon before UN Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) was approved. The resolution called for "a full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by Hezbollah of all attacks and the immediate cessation of Israel of all offensive military operations." It also provided for the deployment of a Lebanese armed force of 15,000 troops in southern Lebanon alongside an expanded UNIFIL force.  The cessation of hostilities was to take effect on the morning of 14 August. The Israeli military appeared determined to maximize its control over southern Lebanon and the ground war continued on 12 and 13 August with renewed intensity. On 14 August the ceasefire officially took effect; however, Israeli and Hezbollah fighters remained close together on the ground and several skirmishes were reported. Despite these minor clashes, Hezbollah did not launch rockets into Israel and Israel carried out no aerial attacks on Lebanon. Israel slowly began to transfer control of the area to Lebanese troops, supported by the existing members of UNIFIL.  Even though Israel and Hezbollah experienced a full-scale war with each other for over a month, Lebanon as a crisis actor did not engage in violent attacks against Israel. Lebanon's crisis management technique throughout the conflict consisted of non-violent activities such as negotiation and mediation.  The small skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah continued into late August. Matters were further complicated when Prime Minister Olmert stated that Israel would not accept additional peacekeepers to the area from countries that did not have diplomatic relations with Israel. UN Secretary-General Annan visited Lebanon on 28 August, the first stop on an extensive Middle East tour, in order to shore up the fragile truce while more UN peacekeeping troops continued to arrive in the area. After intense negotiations with the UN, Israel agreed to lift the blockade on Lebanon. On 7 September Israel lifted its air blockade on Lebanon; the sea blockade was lifted the following day, ending the crisis for both Israel and Lebanon on 8 September 2006.  The U.S. was involved in the crisis both politically and militarily. As soon as the crisis started, the U.S. issued political statements condemning the actions of Hezbollah against Israel. The U.S. also tried to mediate between Israel and Lebanon but its efforts turned out to be fruitless. Later on the in the crisis, the U.S. provided military aid to Israel by sending precision-guided bombs which were used in the air campaign against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.
Ethiopia experienced a foreign policy crisis from 9 October 2006 to 2 January 2007. Ethiopia's foreign policy crisis was caused by the jihad threat of Islamic Courts in neighboring Somalia. The transitional federal government (TFG) of Somalia was formed in 2004 with the support of the United Nations to help the country emerge from anarchy. However, in early June 2006, the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) took over Mogadishu and consolidated control over most of southern Somalia. Ethiopia was deeply concerned about the rise of Islamists on its eastern border and pledged to defend itself and the Somali administration from any Islamist threat. As Somalia came to the brink of civil war in late summer, Ethiopian troops entered the country to support the weak transitional government. The UIC warned Ethiopia of full-scale war unless it withdrew troops but Addis Ababa denied any incursion of Ethiopian troops into Somalia. At the beginning of October, UIC forces captured several villages in northern Somalia bordering Ethiopia. As the military threat of UIC intensified, Ethiopia and Somali troops carried out an offensive operation for the first time in October. On 9 October 2006, Somali soldiers backed by Ethiopian forces briefly seized control of a strategic town in southern Somalia. The UIC declared "holy war" on Ethiopia, accusing the country of launching a full-scale invasion after its troops attacked and briefly held the town. The declaration of jihad on Ethiopia by the Executive Council of the UIC triggered a foreign policy crisis for Ethiopia on October 9. The following day, Ethiopian Prime Minister Zenawi vowed to resist if Somalia's Islamic militia attacked his country. He also called for the deployment of a regional peacekeeping force by the AU and IGAD in Somalia. A week later, Zenawi claimed that jihadists had amassed troops along Somalia's common border with Ethiopia and urged his military to "monitor the issue closely".  The situation deteriorated as fighting between the UIC and TFG forces continued in October. At the end of the month, the UIC captured an Ethiopian officer which prompted Ethiopian Prime Minister Zenawi to acknowledge for the first time that he had sent several hundred armed military advisers across the border. Zenawi also stated that his country was "technically" at war with Somalia's Islamists due to their jihad declaration.  Sudan tried to mediate between the UIC and Ethiopia on October 30, right before the scheduled third round of talks between the transitional government and Islamic Courts in Khartoum. A high-level Sudanese delegation went to Addis Ababa to convince Ethiopia's Prime Minister Zenawi to hold talks with the UIC. The following day, the UIC refused to speak with Somalia's transitional government in Khartoum unless all Ethiopian troops were out of Somalia. After the collapse of Khartoum peace talks on Somalia, both sides warned that war was imminent.  In early November, heavy fighting erupted in northern Somalia as Islamic forces clashed with militia backed by Ethiopian troops. Towards the end of the month, the Ethiopian Prime Minister told parliament that his government had completed gearing up for war with Somalia's Islamists, arguing that Ethiopia had the right to defend itself. The Ethiopian parliament, including the opposition, backed Zenawi and approved military action against Somalia's UIC. Over 100 trucks carrying Ethiopian troops arrived in Baidoa, base of the transitional government, on November 24 and more amassed on the border.  At the beginning of December, Somalia's Islamic group held informal talks with Ethiopia on the sidelines of the IGAD meeting. Top Islamic leader Sheik Sharif Ahmed led the delegation, which met with Ethiopia's State Minister for Foreign Affairs in Djibouti. Officials of Somalia's Islamic movement stressed in the meeting that the group would only hold substantive talks with Ethiopia after it withdrew troops from Somalia.  On 6 December 2006, the U.S.-backed draft resolution which would let regional peacekeeping forces be deployed in Somalia was unanimously endorsed by UN Security Council member states. The UNSC resolution authorized member states of IGAD and AU to deploy a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The U.S.-backed resolution, co-sponsored by the council's African members, partially lifted an arms embargo on Somalia so that regional forces could be supplied with weapons and military equipment. The resolution also urged Somalia's Union of Islamic Courts to halt military expansion and negotiate with the transitional government to achieve a political settlement in the country. While Somalia's transitional government supported the UNSC resolution, the UIC chairman argued that it was biased. He warned that Islamic Courts would fight any foreign troops deployed in the country.  Meanwhile fighting between UIC and the Ethiopia-backed TFG continued in December. On December 12, the Islamic Courts gave Ethiopia a seven-day ultimatum to withdraw its troops. Thousands of Islamic militants surrounded the only town Somalia's government controled, Baidoa, and a top Islamic official said his forces would attack within a week unless troops from Ethiopia left the country. As the situation deteriorated, Yemen mediated between Islamists and the Ethiopian government in mid-December. The mediation occurred after the UN reportedly sent a letter to Yemeni President Salah to intervene in Somalia to prevent a war. President Salah contacted both sides separately and explained the Yemeni proposal, which urged Ethiopia to endorse peace talks and Islamists not to attack any particular area in Somalia or the government based in Baidoa. The mediation by Yemen ended on December 18, one day before the UIC deadline.  Heavy fighting erupted around southern Daynuunay region on December 19 after Ethiopia rejected to withdraw troops from Somalia. Islamist advances against TFG positions around Baidoa were met by an Ethiopian ground and air offensive. Ethiopia admitted launching self-defensive measures against UIC, while the U.S. government supported Ethiopia's right to self-defense. The fighting escalated on December 25 as Ethiopia launched fighter jets across the border and made a direct attack on Mogadishu, which served as the headquarters of UIC. TFG and Ethiopian forces made a rapid advance through UIC-held territory due to Ethiopia's military superiority. Ethiopian troops fought their way closer to Mogadishu towards the end of December, pushing back militias loyal to the Islamic Courts. On December 28, the UIC forces abandoned Mogadishu ahead of advancing Ethiopian forces. A few days later, thousands of Somali and Ethiopian troops advanced to Kismayo, the last remaining stronghold of the UIC. Following a night of intense Ethiopian artillery bombardment near Kismayo, Somalia's interim government also captured Kismayo on January 1. Somalia's prime minister announced that Islamic fighters were scattered and that he did not expect any more major fighting as UIC forces retreated towards Kenyan border.  The crisis ended for Ethiopia after the defeat of the UIC. On January 2, the Ethiopian Prime Minister Zenawi told parliament that Ethiopia had accomplished its mission in Somalia and would withdraw troops as soon as possible. Zenawi also called on the international community to quickly send in peacekeepers to avoid a vacuum.  The U.S. was involved in the crisis both politically and militarily. From the beginning of the crisis, the U.S. approved Ethiopia's actions politically and gave tacit support for Ethiopian intervention in Somalia, arguing that Ethiopia had legitimate security concerns. The U.S. also provided military aid and equipment to Ethiopia throughout the crisis.  The most active regional organization in the crisis was the African Union. On December 27, the AU met at its headquarters in Addis Ababa to try to end the fighting and resume dialogue between Somalia's warring parties. Although the AU declared that Ethiopia had the right to defend itself from the extremist leadership of the Islamic Courts, the AU Commission still called for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops without delay. The AU also urged Somalia's rival factions to stop fighting and resume peace talks sponsored by the Arab League. After the UN Security Council authorized IGAD and AU to establish a "protection and training mission" in Somalia on December 6, the AU approved a plan to send about 8,000 peacekeepers for a six-month mission. Towards the end of December, diplomats from the region started to arrange the deployment of African peacekeepers to help the transitional government establish its authority in Somalia.
A crisis occurred between Chad and Sudan from 31 March 2007 to 17 April 2007. Since 2004, tensions have been high between Chad and Sudan. Chad accuses Sudan of supporting Chadian rebels and Sudan accuses Chad of supporting Sudanese rebels. Crises erupted between the two states in 2005 and 2006. The crisis in 2005 ended with the signing of the Tripoli agreement in February 2006 and the crisis in 2006 ended with an agreement in August 2006. During a summit organized by Libya in February 2007, Chad and Sudan signed an agreement where they pledged not to interfere in each other's territory and to avoid military hostilities. It was the third agreement of the sort in a 12-month period. In the weeks leading up to the crisis, Chad accused Sudanese warplanes of bombing towns in its territory. Sudanese-backed Janjaweed militia began attacks on towns in eastern Chad on 31 March 2007. These attacks, which lasted the weekend, destroyed two villages, and killed more than 100 civilians, sparked a foreign policy crisis for Chad. Chadian security forces managed to push back the attackers, killing an estimated 25 of them. Sudan denied any role in the incident. Chad's major response occurred on 4 April 2007, when Chadian forces launched a retaliatory attack on rebels near the Sudanese border.  On 9 April 2007, rebels from Sudan clashed with Chadian security forces in eastern Chad. As Chadian security forces pursued the 200-vehichle strong rebel column across the Sudanese border, Chadian forces exchanged gunfire with Sudanese military and police forces, killing 17 Sudanese troops. This event caused a foreign policy crisis for Sudan. Sudan's major response occurred on 10 April 2007, when Sudan vowed that it would respond firmly to Chad's aggression and that military action remained a possibility.  A war of words ensued as both countries exchanged threats and accusations. On 10 April 2007, Chad apologized for the clash, but maintained that its forces had the right to pursue rebels across the border.  These events led to a flurry of diplomatic activity, as representatives from China, US, South Africa, Libya, Egypt, and elsewhere met with Sudanese and Chadian leaders. After a brief war of words, both sides sought to avoid escalation of the conflict. There was a general fear among world leaders that the conflict may spill over into Darfur or escalate tensions with rebels fighting the Chad's government. At the same time that they sought rapprochement, both sides held firm on their key positions—Chad maintained that it has the right pursue rebels into Sudanese territory and Sudan maintained that action is needed to back up the apology.  On 12 April 2007, Libyan mediators reached an agreement with Chad and Sudan to allow Eritrean and Libyan military observers to monitor the border region. Both sides resisted calls for a UN peacekeeping force. The crisis ended on 17 April 2007 when mediation by Libya, Eritrea, and the Community of Sahel and Saharan States led to the creation of a joint military and high security committee. On 3 May 2007, another conference was held in Saudi Arabia to further decrease tensions. Both leaders agreed to cooperate with the African Union and United Nations to end the conflict in Darfur and eastern Chad.  For both crisis actors, the main value threat was of limited military damage. Multiple crisis management techniques were used, including violence and mediation. However, violence was only a minor tool in achieving desired goals—Chad's violence against Sudanese forces was an unintended consequence of its retaliation against rebels.  Beyond the two crisis actors, five other states were involved: US, China, and South Africa sent representatives to meet with Sudanese and Chadian leaders (South Africa was also a mediator early in the crisis); and Eritrea and Libya were the principal mediators and participants in the military observer force. While the US was involved diplomatically, its participation did not contribute to crisis abatement. Its participation was viewed favourably by both sides. Russia was not involved in the crisis. The UN's involvement was minor. The Security Council called on both sides to end hostilities and to accept peacekeepers. However, this action had no effect on crisis abatement. The African Union already had a peacekeeping force active in the region. However, this force did not contribute to crisis abatement. Both parties were satisfied with the crisis outcome.  Mediation: On April 10, 2007, Libyan leader President Muammar al-Gaddafi dispatched Abdel Salem Triki, his personal envoy, as part of a mediation effort between Chad and Sudan. Eritrea joined the effort as well, and the two sides met with both mediators that same day. This activity was situated within a larger mediation effort that began on February 21, 2007, when a series of regular meetings involving ministers from Chad, Sudan, Libya, and Eritrea were initiated. These meetings were aimed at defusing border tensions between Chad and Sudan and getting them to both normalize relations and implement the February 2006 Tripoli Agreement that ended the Chad-Sudan I crisis. As part of this effort, a contingency of Libyan, Eritrean, Sudanese, and Chadian military and security observers was deployed in the border region between Chad and Sudan in March 2007 in order to report on and ultimately prevent border incursions and other incidents. The observer mission was part of the Tripoli Agreement signed the previous year but had only recently been deployed as the two sides had come under increasingly intense pressure to implement the agreement and accept UN peacekeepers in the border region. Libya had been putting pressure on both sides to resist the international efforts to get UN peacekeepers on the ground, preferring instead a regional alternative to lessen the need for UN troops.  Triki delivered a plan drafted by al-Gaddafi that was intended to get the two sides to return to the negotiating table, resolve the situation peacefully, ease their tensions, and implement the Tripoli Agreement. On April 10, Chad apologizes for the previous day's border incident. The following day, both sides began toning down their threats and said they were looking to resolve the situation peacefully and improve relations with each other. However, Sudan said that the Chadian apology is not sufficient and that it required more guarantees from Chad that future aggression would not occur. On April 12, Libya and Eritrea dispatched additional military and security observers to the border region between Chad and Sudan in response to the recent hostilities. Two days later, Chad said it would continue to use military force if Chadian rebels and pro-Sudanese militias cross into Chadian territory, and that it hoped Sudan would allow it the right of pursuit in the event that said actors crossed back into Sudanese territory after attacking. On April 16 and 17, Libya, Eritrea, and the Community of Sahel and Saharan States (CEN-SAD, aka COMESSA) met with Chad and Sudan and get them to agree to form a joint military committee and aim toward normalizing relations with each other. Libyan mediator Abdel Salem Triki noted that this agreement would allow the Libyan and Eritrean border observers to "get the means to carry out their mission"(Triki as quoted in Reuters, 04/17/2007). A joint statement was released outlining the agreement, and this terminated the crisis for both Chad and Sudan. The semi-regular ministerial meetings that comprised this mediation effort continued after the crisis terminated, with the last one being held on December 10-11, 2007. In addition to the primary mediation effort by Libya, Eritrea, and CEN-SAD, South Africa also mediated between Chad and Sudan on Apr. 10-11 in an attempt to ease tensions between the two sides and to expand the scope (by adding the UN as a joint partner) and size and of the AU peacekeeping force deployed to deal with the conflict in Darfur, Sudan.
A crisis occurred between Eritrea and Ethiopia from 8 September 2007 to 1 December 2007 as a result of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission's (EEBC) decision to cease attempts at making further progress on demarcating the border between the two countries. The crisis faded on 1 December 2007, the day after the EEBC finalized its 2002 border ruling and dissolved itself as it promised to do so a year earlier. Relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia have remained tense since their 1998-2000 border war (see Case #424). Many of the unresolved matters between the two countries that were present prior to a 2005-06 flare-up over the issue of UN peacekeepers (see Case #446) remained at the outbreak of this current crisis. Under the Algiers Agreement that ended the border war in 2000, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) was appointed by the UN and OAU to decide the final boundary between the two countries. This arbitration commission was housed within the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The EEBC made its border ruling on 13 April 2002, and Eritrea was awarded the disputed town of Badme. At the outbreak of the current crisis, little progress had been made on implementing this border decision by the EEBC. Due to a stalemate in dialogue between Eritrea and Ethiopia, in November 2006 the EEBC gave the two countries until 30 November 2007 to reach agreement and demarcate the border or else its 2002 border ruling would become finalized. Ethiopia was still dissatisfied with the border ruling and blocked its implementation by demanding further negotiation on the issue. Eritrea was still restricting the movement of UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) peacekeepers that were monitoring the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ), arguing that these peacekeepers were operating on internationally-recognized Eritrean territory contrary to the 2002 EEBC ruling. In addition, Eritrea and Ethiopia had further increased their military presence in the border region during 2006 and the first half of 2007, leading to several UN resolutions rebuking them for these actions. Each side intermittently accused the other of preparing a military invasion. Furthermore, the two countries were conducting a proxy war of sorts in neighboring Somalia and had long been accusing each other of supporting the other's anti-state or secessionist rebel opponents. Eritrea was also highly critical of the UN and the United States: the former for exhibiting perceived bias by allowing Ethiopia to disregard the EEBC's ruling, the latter for supporting Ethiopia militarily in its fight against Somalian Islamist rebels and al-Qaeda, and both for not facilitating the implementation of the Algiers Agreement. A crisis was triggered for Eritrea and Ethiopia on 8 September 2007, the day after a meeting of the EEBC ended with the commission saying it could not move forward with trying to resolve the border impasse due to intransigence on both sides. Both sides accused the other of causing the EEBC meeting to fail. Within two days, Eritrea sent a significant number of troops to the TSZ buffer zone, and Ethiopia shifted its troop positions in response. On September 25, Ethiopia sent a formal letter to Eritrea threatening to terminate the Algiers Agreement unless Eritrea began complying with said agreement. Copies of the letter were also sent to the UN Security Council and Secretary General, as well as to the other witnesses of the Algiers Agreement: the African Union, the European Union, Algeria, and the United States. In response to this, three days later Eritrea sent a letter to the same group of states and organizations, arguing that Ethiopian threats to scrap the Algiers Agreement were intended as a precursor for renewing hostilities and urging the UN to urgently implement the EEBC's border ruling. On October 11, the UN Secretary General expressed concern about rising tensions between the two sides and called on them to exercise restraint and implement the Algiers Agreement.  Throughout October, several small skirmishes occurred between Ethiopia and Eritrea. On October 26, Eritrea said it had intelligence that Ethiopia was planning to invade Eritrea during the first week of November, and it accused the United States -- a close Ethiopian ally -- of supporting this plan. Following this, tensions between the two countries reached their highest point in years leading up to the November 30 deadline for the EEBC's border ruling to become finalized and codified into law. Each side sent roughly 100,000 new troop reinforcements to the buffer zone, and reports emerged that Ethiopia was conducting military exercises in the area. Eritrea continued to accuse Ethiopia of planning to launch an offensive and warned of a possible return to full-scale war. In response, Ethiopia increased its defense budget and also launched a massive offensive against Eritrean-backed Somalian rebels, claiming that Eritrea had planned to use these rebels as a distraction so it could invade from the north.  On November 7, the UN Secretary General reported to the Security Council on recent troop movements from both sides and demanded that Eritrea withdraw its troops from the buffer zone. Two days later, the head of UNMEE met with Eritrea and discussed tensions between the two sides. On November 13, the Security Council issued a non-binding statement urging both sides to resolve the border dispute. On November 29, the Secretary General sent letters to both sides indicating its desire to launch a new mediation initiative in mid-December. The effort never came to fruition and was postponed indefinitely, with many analysts suspecting that Eritrea would not accept the mediation offer.  The crisis faded for both Eritrea and Ethiopia on December 1, one day after the EEBC's imposed deadline for the two countries to resolve the border demarcation issue. The EEBC dissolved itself on November 30 and released a statement classifying the border delimitation stipulated in its 2002 ruling as the legal boundary between the two states “until such time as the boundary is finally demarcated” (quoted in Reuters, 30 November 2005). Ethiopia dismissed the deadline and refused to accept the 2002 delimitation ruling, although some sources indicated that Ethiopia was simultaneously happy with the dissolution of the EEBC since it regarded it as an obstacle. At crisis termination, Eritrea was dissatisfied with the continued presence of Ethiopian troops in the border region and UNMEE peacekeepers in the buffer zone. There were also reports of Eritrea registering unhappiness with the coordinates laid out in the 2002 ruling, despite having reiterated consistently since that it accepted the specifics of the delimitation decision. Nevertheless, on December 27, Eritrea said it was satisfied with the final maps of the border presented to it by the EEBC.
A crisis occurred between Chad and Sudan from 26 December 2007 to 1 August 2008. Since 2004, tensions had been high between Chad and Sudan. Chad accused Sudan of supporting Chadian rebels and Sudan accused Chad of supporting Sudanese rebels. Crises erupted between the two states in 2005, 2006, and early 2007. The crisis in 2005 ended with the signing of the Tripoli agreement in February 2006, the crisis in 2006 ended with an agreement in August 2006, and the crisis in early 2007 ended with the formation of a joint military committee in April 2007. The crisis began on 26 December 2007 when Chad held a crisis meeting to deal with what it perceived as preparations to attack by Sudan and Sudanese-backed rebels. The main threat was an attack by the Unified Military Command, an umbrella Chadian rebel organization comprising UFDD, RFC, and UFDD-F. Chad's major response came on December 28 when, according to Sudanese statements, Chadian troops crossed into Sudanese territory with Darfurian rebels from Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Chad's air force bombed two positions in Darfur. The Chadian-JEM incursion on December 28 marked the beginning of the crisis for Sudan. Sudan's response came on the same day when it accused Chad of participating in the attack and said it reserved the right to respond in any way. Throughout the remainder of the crisis, serious clashes occurred, although rarely directly between the two states. Chad and Sudan continued to accuse each other of supporting the other's rebel opponents.  The security situation in Darfur worsened with air and ground raids by Chadian forces and Sudanese rebels. Darfur's capital of El Geneina was under threat during January 2008. Sudan's government continued to obstruct the deployment of a hybrid U.N.-African force in Darfur, and the Sudanese army attacked a UN/AU convoy on January 7. In anticipation of the deployment of EUFOR forces in Chad and Central African Republic, Chadian rebels launched major military attacks inside Chad in late January. On February 2-3, Chadian rebels launched an assault on N'Djamena in an attempt to overthrow the government, which clearly perceived a threat to regime. However, Chadian rebels were forced to withdraw a day later, and they accused France of backing the government.  Libya and Eritrea had previously been the primary mediators between Chad and Sudan, but around the time of the late January 2008 Chadian rebel attacks, a new mediation endeavor occurred with an expanded set of third parties. On January 26, Gabon initiated the mediation effort between Chad and Sudan. The following day, these three states participated in a summit of African countries that was convened to try and defuse tensions between Chad and Sudan and resolve the crisis in Darfur. Libya, Egypt, Eritrea, Senegal, and Mauritania also attended this summit. At the January 27 summit, there was an attempt to gather information on and reconcile the positions of Chad and Sudan, as well as to set the agenda for an upcoming AU conference in which the conflict between these two states figured prominently. The AU Summit occurred from January 31-February 2, and the EU and Iran also attended. At this meeting, the AU tasked Libya and Congo Brazzaville with heading up the mediation effort between Chad and Sudan. On March 6, Senegal announced that it had been conducting shuttle diplomacy between Chad and Sudan, facilitating and proposing solutions and joining Libya and Congo Brazzaville as a lead mediator in the crisis. Senegal also announced that the two sides had consented in principle to sign an agreement at an upcoming meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held in Dakar. Despite Chad's and Sudan's pledge to sign the agreement, both sides continued to accuse each other of supporting the other's rebel groups and questioning each other's prospective commitment to the agreement, blaming each other for breaking all previous agreements. Nevertheless, Chad and Sudan signed the Dakar Agreement on March 13 at the OIC summit. Both sides agreed to stop supporting each other's armed opposition movements and to stop allowing their respective territories to be used as bases from which rebels could launch border incursions. Additional terms of the agreement were as follows: all armed opposition movements would be disarmed by EUFOR peacekeepers in Chad, both sides would normalize their relations and definitively end their differences with each other, and both sides would commit to the string of previous failed agreements brokered by Libya, Eritrea, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The agreement also laid out an implementation plan, including the formation of a "contact group" that would meet monthly to ensure that the deal was implemented in good faith and that no violations occurred. The agreement failed to end the crisis however, as Chad accused Sudan of sending Chadian rebels to attack only hours before the agreement was signed. This confirmed the fears expressed by many analysts, as well as Chadian and Sudanese opposition movements, that the agreement would not be signed in good faith and would have little effect on the overall conflict.  In early May, JEM rebels advanced on Khartoum. On May 10, heavy fighting occurred and the government repelled the assault. The following day, Sudan cut diplomatic ties with Chad in response. On May 12, Chad countered by closing its border with Sudan and cutting economic and cultural ties. Despite this attempt on its capital, Sudan mainly perceived a limited military threat from Chad and JEM rebels. Despite warnings by France, Chadian rebels began a military offensive in early June 2008 and threatened to shoot down any French reconnaissance aircraft. On June 18, Chadian forces defeated the offensive. The EUFOR peacekeeping mission -- in which France played a major role -- had become operational on March 17 and was involved in the June clashes. Chad accused EUFOR of siding with the rebels. This marked the second time during the crisis that the EUFOR mission came under fire, as a EUFOR peacekeeper was killed on March 3 by the Sudanese army after accidentally crossing into Sudan.  The "contact group" charged with implementing the Dakar Agreement met numerous times throughout this series of clashes in the spring and into the summer. The contact group consisted of several African states -- Libya, Congo Brazzaville, Senegal, Gabon, and Eritrea -- as well as a group of high-profile international actors that were viewed as "guarantors" of the agreement -- UN, EU, AU, OIC, the Community of the Sahel and Saharan States (CEN-SAD, aka COMESSA), France, UK, and US. The first meeting of the contact group was held on April 10, and subsequent meetings were held on April 28, June 9, June 24, and July 17. A broad range of issues were discussed at the April and June meetings, but Chad and Sudan were only able to agree on the composition and logistics of a joint observer mission to be deployed in the border region between the two countries. Nevertheless, while working in conjunction with each other, several mediators in the contact group also met individually with one or both sides at various points during the remainder of the crisis and/or issued statements condemning offensives launched by Sudanese and Chadian rebels. While implementation of the Dakar Agreement was a key concern, of prime importance to the mediators in the wake of JEM's early May offensive was to get Chad and Sudan to restore diplomatic relations with one another. At the July 17 meeting of the contact group, Senegal convinced Sudan to agree to restore diplomatic relations with Chad by arguing that the Dakar Agreement could not be implemented if official ties between the two countries were severed. Chad called this move a step in the right direction, but said that it required a stronger commitment from Sudan to stop destabilizing Chad before it would agree to resume relations. Following up on this effort by Senegal, Libya met with Chad and Sudan in late July and made proposals that were accepted by both sides, including the restoration and normalization of diplomatic relations and resumption of cooperation between the two countries, as well as the establishment of a tripartite summit to oversee their previous agreements that was to be sponsored by Libya and include the participation of Presidents Deby and al-Bashir. After meeting with Libya on August 1, Sudanese President al-Bashir instructed the relevant domestic authorities to immediately restore relations with Chad and reopen the Sudanese embassy there. This terminated the crisis for both sides.  After previously criticizing what they viewed as the ineffectiveness of various members of the mediation team (particularly the guarantors of the Dakar Agreement), Sudan and Chad both expressed satisfaction with Libya's efforts that helped contribute -- along with a general stalemated situation -- to the conclusion of the crisis. The contact group continued to meet after the crisis terminated, convening for the final time on 15 November 2008. Several subsequent attempts by the contact group to meet failed. In addition to the large-group primary mediation effort, the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) Group also mediated between Chad and Sudan in late July 2008, sending an ambassadorial mission on a fact-finding mission to the region and talking with both sides in an attempt to find a lasting peaceful settlement.  The UN was heavily involved in the crisis, and in two distinct ways: the Secretary General's participation in the mediation effort as part of the contact group, and the Security Council's provision of emergency military assistance through the deployment of EUFOR and AU/UN forces (although both had been authorized before the crisis).
A crisis occurred between Djibouti and Eritrea over the disputed border region of Ras Doumeira from 7 April to the end of June 2008. Djibouti and Eritrea share a border of 110 km which was initially drawn by Italy and France in 1900, following a dispute in 1898. Although Djibouti and Eritrea had a skirmish and a two-month standoff in 1996, the relations between the two had improved after 2000. More than 1,200 US troops and 2,850 French troops are stationed in Djibouti. Eritrea also has an unresolved border conflict with Ethiopia that has resulted in three crises (cases #424, #446, and #456) since 1998. PRE-CRISIS: According to a Djiboutian report, Eritrea started to deploy military equipment in their common border region in early 2008, in the name of road construction. The crisis began on 7 April 2008 when Eritrean armed forces penetrated into Djiboutian territory, dug trenches on both sides of the border, and occupied Ras-Doumeira. This triggered a crisis for Djibouti. Eritrea denied the charge. The Djiboutian army made a request to probe the situation, which Eritrea also denied. From 7 to 22 April, the two sides pursued negotiations. This also constituted Djibouti’s major response to the crisis trigger. Several rounds of futile negotiations followed. Presidents Isaias Afwerki of Ethiopia and Ismaïl Omar Guelleh of Djibouti were involved in these efforts. On 2 April, Djibouti sent its troops to the border area, and negotiations between the two sides ceased. On 5 May, Djibouti took the case to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the African Union (AU), and the Arab League, all of which urged Djibouti and Eritrea to exercise restraint. Despite the various diplomatic activities and mediation attempts by regional organizations such as the AU and Arab League and friendly countries such as Yemen, Eritrea refused further dialogue with Djibouti. Eritrea also rejected fact finding missions dispatched by both the AU and the Arab League. The military standoff in Ras Doumeira eventually led to clashes between the two sides on 10 June, which triggered a crisis for Eritrea. Eritrea’s major response occurred that same day and consisted of violence. The fighting lasted four days until 13 June, at which point the crisis faded for Eritrea. At least nine Djiboutian soldiers were killed and more than fifty were wounded. Eritrea denied the existence of the armed conflict and refused to reveal the death toll. Despite Eritrea’s denial of the conflict, the UNSC issued a presidential statement (S/PRST/2008/20) on 12 June condemning Eritrea’s military action against Djibouti in Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island. Also, both the AU and the Arab League urged the two countries to remain calm and resolve the dispute peacefully.                                                                                                       On 16 June, France sent three ships, including a frigate and a helicopter carrier to assist Djibouti with medical care, logistics, and intelligence. France did not participate directly in fighting between the two sides. By the end of June, tensions subsided and the crisis faded for Djibouti. Djibouti withdrew its forces, which the UNSC had earlier called upon both sides to do.
From 8 July 2008 to 24 August 2009, a crisis took place for Thailand and Cambodia over an ancient temple located along their shared border. The temple, Preah Vihear, was the subject of a long-standing dispute between the two countries. In 1962, the International Court of Justice awarded ownership of the temple to Cambodia. PRE-CRISIS: In March 2008, Cambodia attempted to unilaterally inscribe Preah Vihear in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) list of World Heritage Sites and informed Thailand of its plans. This attempt was initially supported by the Thai government led by Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, a position that was unpopular with and used as a key rallying point by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) (also known as the Yellow Shirts), a domestic opposition movement that attempted to topple Sundaravej. In June 2008, Thailand and Cambodia issued a joint communiqué regarding the temple registration. Increasing domestic unrest and a ruling by the Thai Constitutional Court that found the communiqué to be unconstitutional led to an alteration in the Thai stance on Cambodia’s move to unilaterally inscribe Preah Vihear prior to the outbreak of the crisis. Embattled Prime Minister Sundaravej eventually withdrew his bid to regain his seat in September 2008, and Thai Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama resigned several days after crisis outbreak as a result of the Thai Constitutional Court ruling. On 8 July 2008, UNESCO announced that Preah Vihear temple was included in the list of World Heritage Sites, triggering a crisis for Thailand. Thailand’s major response was deploying military troops to its border area with Cambodia on 15 July. Cambodia claimed that 50 Thai solders crossed into Cambodian territory about 300 meters from the Preah Vihear temple that day, triggering a crisis for Cambodia. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen believed that the Thai deployment threatened Cambodia’s national security. Sen’s major response was to send military troops to the area that same day by. Over the next several days, the number of Thai and Cambodian soldiers deployed to the area increased to 480 and 800, respectively. On 17 July, Cambodian Prime Minister Sen implemented the other parts of its major response to the perceived crisis trigger by making telephone contact with and sending a written letter to Thai Prime Minister Sundaravej calling for action to defuse the tension and the immediate withdrawal of Thai troops. The following day, Sundaravej responded with a letter to Cambodia insisting that the area around the temple where Thai troops deployed is Thai territory. On 21 July, high-level talks occurred between the Thai army commander and the Cambodian defense minister during a special meeting of the Thai-Cambodian General Border Committee (GBC), but no outcome was achieved. From July to September 2008, both sides dramatically increased their troop deployments in the border region, and the confrontation incrementally deteriorated further. Violence erupted on  October, with both sides blaming one another for instigating the clash. On 14 October,                                                                                                       Cambodian Prime Minister Sen proposed that both sides withdraw troops, but Thailand rejected this proposal. On 15 October, the two sides exchanged fire again. Tensions between the two sides remained high throughout late 2008 and early 2009. No negotiations occurred between the two sides during this period, but neither did violence. On  April 2009, fighting broke out again between the two countries after apparent disagreements between troops over access to the disputed area. A Thai soldier crossed into Cambodian territory and stepped on a landmine. The two sides subsequently exchanged artillery, mortar, and grenade fire. Tensions continued until late August 2009, when both sides engaged in deescalatory moves. On 22 August, Cambodian Prime Minister Sen announced troop reductions in the border region, proposing a cut of 50 percent. In response, a Thai general said Thailand would do the same. Two days later on 24 August, top military leaders of Cambodia and Thailand met in Phnom Penh and officially announced troop reductions and an end to hostilities. This terminated the crisis for both sides. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was involved in the crisis in a low-level manner. ASEAN attempted to set up a “contact group” to mediate the standoff between Thailand and Cambodia but decided against it on 22 July 2008 after Thailand opposed the idea on the grounds that the two countries should try to resolve the dispute bilaterally before seeking the help of outsiders. ASEAN discussed the crisis in its general meeting and encouraged both parties to resolve the conflict through bilateral talks. Cambodia appealed to the UN Security Council (UNSC) to take up the case, but ASEAN persuaded the UNSC to not do so. ASEAN preferred that the parties resolve the situation bilaterally and was also concerned about potential harm to its organizational reputation and credibility had the parties too quickly resorted to UN Security Council action to solve the crisis. At a November 2009 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, after the crisis terminated, the Thai prime minister asked Indonesia to help resolve the conflict in its role as chair of ASEAN. Reluctant to get involved in other countries’ internal affairs, Indonesia denied the request, saying that the two sides can manage the issue without additional third party involvement.
From 7 to 16 August 2008, Russia and Georgia experienced a crisis known regionally as the Five-Day War (also known as the Russo-Georgian War or the August War). Since its independence, Georgia has struggled to stabilize major separatist movements located in three regions that are internationally recognized as part of Georgian territory: Adzharia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Both the South Ossetian and Abkhazian separatist movements are backed by Russia. This state of affairs has led to three prior crises between Georgia and Russia, the most recent occurring from June to November 2004 (see Case #445). Russian peacekeepers were sent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the wake of armed conflicts in both regions in the early 1990s and have remained stationed there until the present day. PRE-CRISIS: On 29 April 2008, Russia announced a unilateral increase of peacekeepers in Georgian-populated areas of Abkhazia. This increased tensions between Russia and Georgia. In July, several explosions in South Ossetia killed locals, including a police chief. The spokesperson of South Ossetia claimed that the bombings were assassinations conducted by Georgian secret services. Georgia claimed that the bombings were done by Russia to justify its presence in South Ossetia. Following these bombings, South Ossetia prepared for war, which provoked Georgia in turn. According to Georgia, Russia began moving its troops toward battle areas inside South Ossetia on 7 August 2008, which triggered a crisis for Georgia. Georgia’s major response was to mobilize its reservists and declare a 15-day “state of war” the next day, which in turn triggered a crisis for Russia. Russia initiated its major response that same day by clashing with Georgian forces in South Ossetia, while also requesting an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Russian troops were backed by separatist Abkhaz forces in their military efforts. Russia stated that its goal was to protect its peacekeepers and ethnic Russians in South Ossetia. Five days of heavy fighting occurred between the two sides. Georgian forces were defeated in most battles and retreated on 11 August, enabling the Russians to occupy several Georgian cities. On 9 August, Foreign Minister of the European Union, Bernard Kouchner, flew to Tbilisi together with Finnish Foreign Minister and OSCE chairman, Alexander Stubb. The following morning, they drafted a tentative ceasefire proposal on three key issues: a cessation of hostilities, recognition of Georgia’s territorial integrity, and rapid re-establishment of the status quo. On 12 August, a mediation effort conducted by the EU and OSCE began as then president of the EU, Nicolas Sarkozy, presented this plan to Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. A preliminary ceasefire agreement was signed by the parties that same day. Based on the proposal presented by Sarkozy, he and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev drafted the “six principles” of a peace plan. On 13 August, Georgia requested revisions of the terms of the plan, to which Russia agreed. On 15 August, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the revised peace agreement during a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State. Medvedev signed the agreement the following day. This terminated the crisis for both sides. The peace agreement was unanimously supported by all members of the EU. The agreement was sent to the UNSC to be formalized. The UNSC had attempted to agree on a statement calling for a truce while the fighting was ongoing during the crisis, but it failed.                                                                                                         Most of the Russian forces stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained there under bilateral agreements with the corresponding governments until 2010, when Russia began troop withdrawals. Moscow claimed that the Five-Day War killed more than 2,000 civilians, but the official EU report estimated that the casualties were around 850 with over 2,000 wounded.
A crisis surrounding the launch of a satellite and a nuclear test by North Korea began on 1 March 2009 and lasted until 4 August 2009. Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were the crisis actors. This was the fourth crisis related to North Korea’s nuclear program (see cases #408, 441, and 450). Though Japan was involved in each of the previous three crises in this protracted conflict, this was the first in which Japan perceived a foreign policy crisis itself. It was also the first time since the end of World War II that Japan was involved in a crisis as a crisis actor. PRE-CRISIS: Rumors of a planned missile launch by North Korea began circulating in February 2009, when South Korean sources said that North Korea was assembling the Taepodong-2 rocket at a missile base on its east coast. On 24 February, the South Korean media reported that North Korean preparations for launching an experimental communications satellite were underway. Japan, South Korea, and the United States warned North Korea that the planned satellite launch would be in violation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1718 that called on North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear programs. They also indicated that the Security Council would consider further action should North Korea go through with the launch. North Korea responded that the launch was part of a legitimate and peaceful space program and that shooting it down would be an act of war. On 11 March 2009, North Korea announced a time frame for its satellite launch, turning its previous general statements about a potential future launch into a concrete situation with a finite time frame. This triggered a crisis for Japan, South Korea, and the United States, all three of which believed that the satellite launch was actually a disguised missile test (a perception held by many other members of the international community as well). The following day the United States implemented the most important part of its major response by moving naval forces to South Korea to participate in joint military drills. The drills occurred that same day, and while they were a regularly scheduled annual exercise, two US ships capable of intercepting the North Korean launch remained after the drills were completed and were hosted by South Korea. This triggered a crisis for North Korea that same day. South Korea’s major response to the crisis trigger consisted of hosting the US ships after the joint military drills were completed on 1 March, and most importantly, an announcement on 18 March that it would deploy an interception-capable destroyer to track North Korea’s planned missile launch. Also on 18 March, Japan announced that it was considering deploying its own naval units capable of interception in coordination with the United States; this constituted the most important part of its major response. North Korea reiterated that an attempt to intercept the launch would be considered an act of war. Over the following two days, North Korea rejected further American food aid, despite continuing need, and detained two American journalists. Japan, South Korea, and the United States mobilized Aegis-equipped destroyers to potentially intercept debris from the launch in late March.                                                                                                      On 5 April, North Korea proceeded with the launch. The decision to go through with these drills represented North Korea’s major response to its crisis trigger. No interception attempt or damage from debris occurred. North Korea claimed that the launch was a success and that the satellite was sent into orbit, but much of the international community contends that the payload fell into the Pacific Ocean without reaching orbit. The launch of the rocket was sharply condemned by the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and the United States as a clear violation of UNSC Resolution 1718. On 13 April, the UN Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the rocket launch, and declaring it a violation of Resolution 1718. In response, North Korea withdrew from the six-party talks and stated that it would no longer be bound by any agreements previously reached under the talks. On 16 April, North Korea expelled International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and US monitors from the Yongbyon nuclear complex. On 25 May, North Korea conducted its second underground nuclear test, which was met with condemnation from the international community. In response to the test, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1874 on June 12, formally condemning the test and tightening sanctions on North Korea. In July, a number of North Korean entities were designated for sanctions, which was a follow-up step in the implementation of Resolution 1874. Tensions began to slowly fade until 4 August, when former US President Bill Clinton visited North Korea and secured the release of the US journalists detained by North Korea. This led to a return to pre-crisis levels of all four crisis actors’ perceptions of threat, thus terminating the crisis.
A crisis occurred between Chad and Sudan from 5 May 2009 to 9 February 2010. Since 2004, tensions had been high between Chad and Sudan. Chad accused Sudan of supporting Chadian rebels, and Sudan accused Chad of supporting Sudanese rebels. Previous crises erupted between the two states in 2005, 2006, and twice in 2007. The most recent crisis between Chad and Sudan terminated on 1 August 2008 with the reestablishment of diplomatic ties following efforts of multiple mediators (see case #455; the other crises between Chad and Sudan are cases #447, #449, and #453). Earlier in that crisis, in March 2008, Chad and Sudan signed the Dakar Agreement, a broader accord in which they agreed to stop supporting each other's rebel groups, resolve their overall differences with one another, and commit to upholding a series of previous failed peace agreements. The primary mediation effort in that crisis was conducted by a large “contact group” consisting of several African states and a group of high-profile international guarantors and was tasked with helping to implement the Dakar Agreement. This effort ultimately failed to achieve its objective: the contact group met a number of times in the months following the crisis but then failed to meet again after 11 November 2008 despite several attempts. Qatar began a separate mediation effort in early 2009, meeting with Sudan in late February and then Chad in early March. But a definitive resolution of the conflict between Chad and Sudan remained elusive, as the overall peace process between Chad and Sudan once again stalled and the two sides continued to support each other’s rebel groups. The crisis began on 5 May 2009 when the Sudanese-backed Union of Resistance Forces (URF/UFR) crossed the border from Sudanese to Chadian territory. This triggered a crisis for Chad. Chad’s major response consisted of both an accusation toward Sudan that same day and, most importantly, a military attack against the rebels two days later. On 5 May, Chad publically accused Sudan of backing the rebel incursion. This triggered a crisis for Sudan. Sudan’s major response was to deny that it supported URF the following day; URF also denied that it was receiving support from Sudan. Then, on 7 May, Chadian military forces engaged the URF in the Battle of Am Dam. The battle resulted in more than 200 deaths and a victory for the Chadian government. Sudan claimed that the Chadian Air Force also conducted strikes against URF rebels within Sudanese territory. Sudan characterized these airstrikes as “acts of war” and threatened to shoot down Chadian planes if they crossed into Sudanese airspace again. In the months that followed, Chad and Sudan engaged in several exchanges of air strikes, and Chadian troops conducted several incursions across its border with Sudan. Chad also continued to intermittently clash with URF, albeit at a lower level than in May. Tensions between Chad and Sudan remained high, and Sudan continued to deny that it was supporting Chadian rebels. On 25 December, Chad and Sudan agreed to implement previous protocols that addressed controlling the border between the two countries. There were no more major clashes after this point. On 15 January 2010, another agreement was signed by Chad and Sudan, this time mediated by Libya. The agreement reduced tensions somewhat but did not terminate the crisis.                                                                                                     On 9 February 2010, Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Sudan and met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. During the visit, Chad and Sudan signed a formal agreement in which they agreed that neither would support rebel organizations targeting the other. This returned the perceived level of threat to pre-crisis level, terminating the crisis for both sides. Libya and Qatar coordinated in mediating between Chad and Sudan during the crisis. Qatar originally began its mediation effort alone and prior to the crisis period, but it was eventually joined by Libya. Qatar was more active early and for most of the crisis, but Libya was more active at the end. The Qatarese Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, led the Qatarese part of the effort, and Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi led the Libyan part of the effort. Libya’s mediation of the 15 January 2010 agreement between Chad and Sudan had a marginal positive effect on crisis abatement, reducing tensions between the two countries to some degree less than a month before they bilaterally terminated the crisis. Both Qatar’s and Libya’s mediation was facilitative in nature. The United States was also involved in the crisis as a mediator of the conflict between the Sudanese government and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel group in Darfur. US President Barack Obama’s special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force General J. Scott Gration, led this effort. The US effort was effective and also had a positive indirect influence on the resolution of the international crisis between Chad and Sudan because Chad was supporting JEM. However, the US did not directly mediate the international crisis between Chad and Sudan. The United Nations (UN) and African Union (AU) were minimally involved in the crisis. Rodolphe Adada, the UN-AU Joint Special Representative (JSR) in Darfur and head of the joint UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), called on Chad and Sudan to end their hostile interactions and resolve their conflict peacefully via negotiations. The AU also condemned the two sides’ use of force to resolve their differences.
South Korea and North Korea experienced a four-month crisis over the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan on 26 March 2010. The area where the Cheonan sinking incident happened has always been a site of considerable tension between South Korea and North Korea. The situation is further complicated by the presence of a rich fishing ground in the area used by North Korean and Chinese fishing vessels. There were numerous clashes over the years between South Korean and North Korean naval vessels attempting to police what both sides regard as their territorial waters. PRE-CRISIS: On the night of the sinking of the Cheonan, the United States and South Korean navies were engaged in joint anti-submarine exercises 75 miles away from the site of the sinking. This exercise was part of the two countries’ annual Key Resolve/Foal Eagle war exercise, described by the US Pentagon as “one of the world’s largest simulated exercises,” and involved modern US and South Korean warships. On 26 March 2010, an explosion was reported to have occurred near the ROKS Cheonan, a South Korean warship. This triggered a crisis for South Korea. Initial reports suggested that the ship was hit by a North Korean torpedo, and that a South Korean vessel had returned fire. Of the ship’s crew of 104 men, 46 died. South Korean officials initially downplayed suggestions that North Korea was responsible for the sinking. After raising the ship, South Korea and the US formed a joint investigative team to discover the cause of the sinking; South Korea led the team. A second, separate, and broader South Korean-led investigative effort followed; the US, Sweden, Australia, and the United Kingdom also participated in this effort. On 19 May, this second investigative team concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the ship. Around this time, North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-Il, ordered North Korea's forces to be ready for combat. Near the end of May, a team of Russian experts visited South Korea to conduct an assessment of the results produced by the second South Korean-led investigation. The Russian assessment concluded that the Cheonan was not sunk by a North Korean bubble jet torpedo, but it did not come to any firm conclusion about the cause of the sinking. After the release of the official report in which North Korea was blamed for the sinking, South Korea announced on 24 May that it would stop nearly all of its trade with North Korea and prohibit North Korean vessels from using its shipping channels. This constituted South Korea’s major response to the crisis trigger, and it in turn triggered a crisis for North Korea. That same day, South Korea also demanded an apology from North Korea for the sinking and announced a resumption of “psychological warfare” tactics aimed at North Korea. Also on the same day, President Lee Myung-bak said that South Korea would respond to further military provocations from North Korea with self-defense measures, and that he supported readopting the official description of the North as the “main enemy.” Finally on that day, the US and South Korea announced that they would conduct joint naval exercises in response to the sinking. North Korea’s major response to the South Korean embargo that triggered its crisis came on 25 May and consisted of putting its troops on high alert and reverting to a wartime footing in                                                                                                   regard to South Korea. That same day, North Korea also severed most remaining ties and communications with South Korea, with the exception of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and forbade any South Korean ships or aircraft from entering North Korean territory. Also that day, the South Korean military resumed “psychological warfare” directed at North Korea as planned; this included both loudspeaker and FM radio propaganda broadcasts across the Demilitarized Zone. On 27 May, North Korea announced that it would scrap an agreement aimed at preventing accidental naval clashes with South Korea. It also announced that any South Korean vessel found crossing the disputed maritime border would be immediately attacked. The following day, the North Korean Central News Agency released an official response to the second South Korean-led investigation, denying having had anything to do with the sinking. On 14 June, South Korea presented the results of its investigation to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). On 9 July, the UNSC issued a Presidential Statement condemning the attack but without identifying the attacker. Amid heightened tensions with North Korea, the US and South Korea launched joint military exercises on 25 July despite strong objections from China. The exercises were focused on anti-submarine and maritime interdiction capabilities. Hostile rhetoric from both sides gradually died down and tensions started to fade after the military exercises. The crisis terminated for both sides on 26 July without a clear-cut terminating act. The US and China were both involved in the crisis. The US was mainly involved via its staging of joint military exercises with South Korea, but it also condemned North Korea. China voiced strong opposition to the joint US-South Korean military exercises, but its main involvement was effectively resisting US calls for a tougher line against North Korea throughout the crisis. The UN’s condemnation of the attack had little to no effect on the crisis proceedings. NATO also condemned the attack, but went further than the UN by singling out North Korea’s role in the attack. Nevertheless, NATO’s involvement also did not contribute to crisis abatement.
A crisis involving North Korea and South Korea surrounding incidents on the disputed Yeonpyeong Island occurred between 23 November 2010 and 19 June 2011. The crisis occurred amidst the backdrop of a long-running maritime border dispute between North and South Korea. The US was also significantly involved in the crisis, mainly due to its holding of military exercises with South Korea both before and during the crisis. Yeonpyeong Island lies on the South Korean side of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the maritime boundary between the North and South Korea that was drawn up by the United Nations after the end of the Korean War in 1953. North Korea accepted this demarcation for almost two decades before it began disputing it in the 1970s. Tensions surrounding the boundary decreased in the wake of a 1991 non-aggression pact between the two Koreas, but re-escalated when North Korea began disputing the boundary again in the mid-1990s. Minor military incidents occurred between the two sides near Yeonpyeong Island in 1999 and 2002. On 10 November 2009, another skirmish between the South and North Korea navies occurred near the NLL. Tensions further intensified after the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, in March 2010 (see case #461). PRE-CRISIS: Tensions increased further between South Korea and North Korea in the month prior to the crisis. On 14 October 2010, South Korea hosted Exercise Eastern Endeavor, a naval drill also involving the United States, Japan, and Australia. This drill was part of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), a multinational effort aimed at stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. North Korea denounced the drill as an open declaration of war, as it did in 2009 when South Korea joined the PSI in the wake of a North Korean nuclear test. Then, on 16 November 2010, South Korea announced that it would launch a large-scale annual military exercise, the Hoguk Exercise, with the US the following week. North Korea viewed the exercise as preparation for war. Hours before the exercise began on 23 November, North Korea wired a complaint, said that it would not “just sit back while the South is carrying out the live- fire exercise,” and warned of military action if South Korea and the U.S. fired in its territorial waters. On 23 November 2010, South Korea and the US held the Hoguk Exercise on Yeonpyeong Island as previously announced, which triggered a crisis for North Korea. North Korea’s major response consisted of firing artillery shells onto Yeonpyeong Island that same day, which triggered a crisis for South Korea. Following an emergency meeting of top aides and security ministers called by South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, South Korea implemented its major response by firing back at the North Korean military that same day. The exchange of fire intensified for a short while before ending in the afternoon that day. Shortly afterwards that same day, South Korea and the US announced that they planned another round of similar military  exercises for some time between 17 and 21 December. North Korea responded it would consider such exercises a grave provocation and would respond appropriately. In the aftermath of the attack, South Korean President Lee received much domestic public criticism for not responding more forcefully. On 25 November, the South Korean defense minister resigned; South Korea announced a dramatic troop and heavy weapon increase on Yeonpyeong Island; and President Lee announced changes to the rules of engagement permitting a more forceful military response, particularly if civilians are threatened. North Korea threatened further military action if South Korea continued what, according to North Korea, was a course of military provocation. On 28 November, China proposed emergency consultations by representatives of the six-party talks to try and help resolve the crisis. China’s proposal was rejected by the US, South Korea, and Japan. On 18 December, Russia’s ambassador to the UN appealed for an emergency UNSC meeting. The meeting was held the following day. Russia presented a draft statement with the hopes of adoption by the UNSC, but it could not secure sufficient support. China opposed including language in the statement that would criticize North Korea. Around this time, New Mexico Governor and former US diplomat Bill Richardson accepted an invitation from North Korea to try and reduce tensions. Richardson conducted a four-day mission in Pyongyang as a private citizen beginning on 16 December. On 20 December, Richardson reported that North Korea was willing to discuss the formation of a military commission consisting of representatives from North Korea, South Korea and the US that would monitor and prevent conflicts in the disputed areas in the Yellow Sea. Richardson also reported that North Korea agreed to allow monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its uranium-enrichment facility. The White House rejected the idea of new multinational talks with North Korea, and said it needed to change its belligerent behavior first. From 20 to 25 December, South Korea carried out naval drills on Yeonpyeong Island and the Sea of Japan. On 23 December, North Korea called South Korea’s exercises a preparation for war and threatened a nuclear deterrent response. In January 2011, North Korea proposed working-level military talks with South Korea. These talks began on 8 February but ended abruptly with both sides blaming the other for the failed talks. North Korea claimed that the South made unreasonable demands and was uninterested in improving ties. South Korea wanted the talks to focus on the Cheonan and Yeonpyeong incidents and claimed that the North maintained its refusal to apologize and accept responsibility for these incidents. For the next several months, tensions began to slowly ease but nevertheless continued to simmer and remain unresolved, with little headway made toward abatement. Then, on 19 June, facing the threat of another possible nuclear test from North Korea, South Korea announced that while it still wanted an apology from North Korea over the 2010 incidents, it would no longer make such  an apology a prerequisite for restarting the six-party talks. After this statement, the crisis faded for both North Korea and South Korea.
Another crisis for Thailand and Cambodia over the long-disputed ancient Preah Vihear temple took place from 4 February to 21 December 2011. Tensions over the temple played a role in a crisis between the two countries in 1958 (see case #167). The dispute over the temple was also central to a subsequent crisis that occurred in 2008 when the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) approved Cambodia’s unilateral application to list the temple as a World Heritage site. That crisis saw significant troop deployments and a series of clashes between the two sides near the site of the temple, and it terminated with a bilateral agreement to reduce troop deployment levels at the site. But neither side fully removed its forces from the area, nor was the issue of sovereign control of the temple and the surrounding area resolved (see case #457). PRE-CRISIS: Thailand requested assistance from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in November 2009 to help resolve the conflict, reversing its prior stance against ASEAN intervention. ASEAN rejected the request and expressed its view that the two sides should resolve the conflict bilaterally. Intermittent clashes erupted between Thailand and Cambodia over the temple in January and April 2010. The Thai military claimed that the clashes were caused by misunderstandings, and these incidents did not escalate to the level of crisis. In August 2010, Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen called for an international conference to discuss the dispute, but Thailand rejected the call. On 4 February 2011, Thai and Cambodian troops battled near the Preah Vihear temple. This triggered a crisis for both sides. The initiator of the clashes was unclear, and both sides claimed the other side fired first. The major responses from both Thailand and Cambodia consisted of further military clashes and, later that day, a phone conversation between Thai Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh. The phone call was initiated by Wongsuwan. The two countries discussed the border clash and the conditions for a ceasefire. A ceasefire was reached, but clashes resumed shortly thereafter. Immediately after the first armed clash, Cambodia asked the UN Security Council (UNSC) to convene an urgent meeting. Thereafter, the UNSC invited envoys from Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia, then chair of ASEAN, to discuss the issue. Both Hun Sen and his Thai counterpart, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, submitted facts to the UNSC and claimed that the other party initiated the armed attack. On 7 February, a short UN mediation effort occurred when representatives from Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia met with UNSC members to discuss the issue. The same day, the UNSC released a press statement expressing its “grave concern” over the situation and support of ASEAN attempts to initiate a separate mediation effort between Thailand and Cambodia. On 21 February, ASEAN held an informal regional group meeting in Jakarta to seek a solution to the dispute, beginning the primary mediation effort between the two sides. The foreign ministers of Cambodia and Thailand both attended the meeting and agreed to allow Indonesian observers                                                                                                         to monitor disputed border territory. Despite such efforts, armed clashes broke out again in April and spread to the Thai province of Surin. Another ceasefire agreement soon followed. On 28 April, Cambodia approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ), requesting it to interpret its 1962 judgment regarding the temple. Thailand asked the court to drop the case, maintaining its position in favor of a bilateral framework. In July, the ICJ released its ruling; the judges voted unanimously to reject Thailand’s claim over the temple. Furthermore, the court issued provisional measures, ordering both Thailand and Cambodia to withdraw troops from the disputed area and send observers, consisting of Thai, Cambodian, and Indonesian representatives. Cambodia accepted the ICJ ruling. Thai political leaders initially accepted the decision but reversed this position after the Thai military objected to the deployment of observers in particular, claiming that such a deployment would undermine Thai national sovereignty. In the meantime, Indonesia had proposed a “solution package” on 9 May that included a three- step process consisting of: 1) agreeing to the terms of reference, 2) assigning the team of Indonesia observers, and 3) resuming talks under the General Border Committee (GBC) and Joint Boundary Commission (JBC), the bilateral mechanisms for resolving the border conflict that were created in 1995 and 2000, respectively. Thailand, however, requested to postpone meetings of the GBC and JBC due to upcoming national elections in July, and then an unprecedented flood in the fall. Another minor armed clash occurred on 15 December, followed by an apology by Cambodia. Six days later, Cambodia hosted a meeting of the GBC in Phnom Penh. Both parties agreed to withdraw their troops, establish a “provisional demilitarized zone,” set up a Joint Working Group to help complete the troop withdrawal, and send observers as the ICJ ordered. This agreement terminated the crisis for Cambodia and Thailand. Although the agreement was oral and Indonesian observers were never sent, both sides withdrew their troops in July 2012. The ASEAN mediation effort that began in February lasted until a Foreign Ministers Meeting on 19 July. An ASEAN summit occurred in November as well, and ASEAN called on both sides to peacefully resolve their differences with the engagement of Indonesia, but no meeting to discuss the border dispute occurred at this summit.
A crisis occurred from 22 February 2011 to 20 October 2011 between Libya and a coalition of international actors (mostly NATO members) that were opposed to the brutal repression by Muammar Gaddafi’s regime of anti-government protesters and rebel supporters during an emerging civil war. The anti-Gaddafi coalition states that experienced a crisis included the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar. A dozen other NATO and non-NATO regional actors were also involved in the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libya. PRE-CRISIS: In mid-January 2011, inspired in part by the civil uprising that occurred earlier in Tunisia, small protests began to emerge in Libya, focusing on issues such as corruption, local concerns, and a desire for greater political freedoms. These eventually gave way to mass demonstrations against the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli and Benghazi beginning in early February. By mid-February, protests spread to the rest of the country and civilians began demanding that Gaddafi step down. The Gaddafi regime responded with a violent repression campaign against demonstrators. Repression escalated significantly beginning on 16 February, and reports of mass killings occurred on 17 and 19 February. This attracted significant attention and condemnation from the international community. On 16 February, Human Rights Watch called for intervention in Libya, particularly from the members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). On 18 February, the US condemned the violence and voiced support for democratic reforms and economic openness in Libya and other states that were part of the Arab Spring. On 19 February, the UK called for an immediate end to the use of force against civilians. On 21 February, Canada also condemned the violence. That same day, the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, met with Gaddafi, and the UN Deputy Permanent Representative for Libya, Ibrahim Dabbashi, called on the UN to impose a no-fly zone over Tripoli. On 22 February 2011, the escalating protests and repression in Libya reached a tipping point. Libya responded to mass protests against the regime that day with military force, including the use of helicopter gunships, artillery fire, and snipers. On the same day, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi delivered a potent speech in which he threatened to show no mercy to protestors, urged his loyalists to attack protesters and their supporters, and vowed to never resign or leave Libya. The culmination of escalating repression and Gaddafi’s speech triggered foreign policy crises for the United States, United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, and Qatar. The major responses from these states were multi-faceted, beginning with condemnations on 22-23 February, escalating quickly to more substantial political and/or economic pressure, and culminating in mid-March with the most important general response: UN authorization and implementation of a no-fly zone in order to protect Libyan civilians. On 23 February, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for the European Union to impose sanctions against Libya and suggested that the assets of the Gaddafi family should be frozen. On 25 February, the US closed its embassy in Tripoli and imposed unilateral economic sanctions on Libya, including the freezing of billions in Libyan government assets. That same day, Canada began Operation MOBILE, a non-combatant mission in which armed forces were sent to facilitate the evacuation of Canadian citizens and other                                                                                                      foreign nationals from Libya. On 26 February, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1970, which imposed sanctions on Libya and referred the situation to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. The sanctions included an arms embargo and a travel ban and asset freeze on members of the Gaddafi regime. On 28 February, Italy suspended its friendship treaty with Libya, a treaty that also included a nonaggression clause. On 3 March, the US threatened to impose military sanctions on Libya, including a no-fly zone, and Obama issued the first public statement in which he demanded that Gaddafi step down and leave Libya. Early condemnations and calls for action also came from the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on 22 February and the African Union (AU) one day later. The Arab League’s involvement was most important: on 12 March, it called on the UN to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. This helped to spur and legitimize an effort from the wider international community to do the same. The AU called for a transition to a post-Gaddafi Libya, but advocated for a negotiated process. On 17 March, the UNSC voted to adopt Resolution 1973, which imposed a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace in order to protect civilians. The resolution was proposed by the UK, France, and Lebanon. Voting to adopt this resolution constituted the most important part of the major responses to the crisis trigger from the UK, US, and France. The passing of the UNSC resolution triggered a crisis for Libya. The Libyan foreign minister, Moussa Koussa, declared a ceasefire later that day, framing it as a response to the UN resolution. However, Libyan artillery shelling on Misrata and Ajdabiya continued, and government soldiers continued approaching Benghazi. On 19 March, Libya issued its major response in the form of a public statement from Gaddafi in which he harshly condemned the UNSC resolution and vowed to arm the Libyan people and fight to the end to protect them from “colonial, crusader” aggression. That same day, Libyan government troops and tanks entered Benghazi, and artillery and mortars were fired into the city. Enforcement of the no-fly zone also began on 19 March. This constituted the most important part of Canada’s and Italy’s major responses to the crisis trigger. Airstrike operations led by the UK, the US, France, and Canada were launched against Gaddafi’s forces in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Misrata that day. Qatari fighter jets joined the enforcement effort the following day, which constituted the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger. These operations were eventually merged into a single NATO operation named Operation Unified Protector. The establishment of the no-fly zone provided vital assistance to the Libyan opposition groups. As the Libyan state was dealt heavy blows from both the domestic opposition and the foreign interveners, the international community began recognizing the National Transition Council (NTC) as the official representative of the Libyan people. In June, Gaddafi offered to hold elections and promised to step aside if he lost, but this offer was rejected by the NTC. On 20 August, the NTC began a major offensive in the form of the Battle of Tripoli and ultimately took control of the Libyan capital. Qatari special forces supported Libyan rebels in their attack on Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya during this battle. Forces of Operation Unified Protector continued to fly thousands of sorties in support of the Libyan opposition.                                                                                                       The Libyan opposition completed their goal of removing Gaddafi from power in the Battle of Sirte on 20 October, and Gaddafi was killed in the aftermath of the battle. This effectively ended the civil war, constituted a change in the Libyan regime, and terminated the crisis for all actors. Operation Unified Protector officially came to a close on 31 October 2011, which was also the day that Abdel Rahim al-Keeb assumed the office of interim Prime Minister of Libya after being appointed to the position by the NTC. At the outset of the crisis, humanitarian concerns were paramount for the NATO members that perceived a crisis. The situation in Libya constituted a threat to non-material, moral values, specifically human rights, and invoked the Responsibility to Protect norm. Italy also had economic concerns, as it received 25% of its oil and 10% of its natural gas from Libya, and the two countries were heavily mutually invested in each other. France also perceived a threat to influence, adopting a strong anti-regime stance in order to help recover its reputation after taking failed pro-regime stances in several prior Arab Spring uprisings (e.g., Tunisia, Egypt). A number of the European crisis actors also had concerns about the possible influx of refugees. Qatar was primarily motivated by the opportunity to expand its regional influence. Operation Unified Protector had both air and naval components. Qatar only contributed to the air component, while all other members of the coalition that were also crisis actors contributed to both components. During the operation, the US flew the largest number of sorties (2000), followed by the UK and France (1300 and 1200, respectively), and then Italy and Canada (600 and 358, respectively). The US also provided covert support for NATO and the Libyan rebels. Qatar’s combat deployment was the first by an Arab or Muslim-majority country and thus of critical regional and diplomatic significance. It was also the only country to commit ground troops to the effort, sending hundreds of special forces to train and fight alongside the Libyan opposition. Qatar also provided weapons to the opposition. Additional NATO and non-NATO countries that were involved in the enforcement of the no-fly zone, albeit to a lesser degree than the crisis actors, included Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Jordan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Russia and China were minimally involved in the crisis. Russia abstained from the UNSC vote on Resolution 1973, but both the Russian representative to the UN and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin heavily criticized it. Russia and China also signed a joint declaration emphasizing the need for a political, not military, solution to the crisis. In the aftermath of this crisis, Libya struggled with establishing an effective government. Elections for the General National Congress (GNC) were held in July 2012, and the NTC transferred power to it one month later. In March 2014, the General National Congress voted to replace itself with a new legislature named the Council of Deputies. Elections were held three months later with low turnout. The Council of Deputies took up residence in Tobruk and is the internationally recognized government of Libya. Former GNC and Islamist parties fared poorly in the elections and set up a rival government in Tripoli. Militias that fought against the Gaddafi regime vied for power in post-Gaddafi Libya, with violence beginning in 2011. By 2013, Libya became a failed state and was in a near-anarchic situation. Violence escalated in 2014, eventually                                                                                                   leading to the emergence of a second Libyan civil war. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) also established a presence in Libya in 2014 and contributed further to this violence.
An international crisis in Cote d’Ivoire related to the Second Ivorian Civil War began on 3 April 2011 and lasted until 11 April 2011. Cote d’Ivoire was the only crisis actor. France was also involved in the crisis. A civil war was fought in Cote d’Ivoire from 2002 to 2004 between the regime of President Laurent Gbagbo and rebel forces representing Muslim northerners, who felt that they were being discriminated against by the politically dominant and mostly Christian southerners. In 2002, France sent a large contingent of troops to Cote d’Ivoire as the Operation Unicorn peacekeeping force. In February 2004, the United Nations established the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to facilitate the implementation of peace agreements. PRE-CRISIS: A presidential crisis began in Cote d’Ivoire in early December 2010 when the incumbent president, Laurent Gbagbo, disputed the results of the presidential election held the previous month, in which challenger Alassane Ouattara claimed victory. The Ivorian Constitutional Council supported Gbagbo’s claim, while the Ivorian Independent Elections Commission (CEI) and the majority of the international community supported Ouattara’s claim. A series of protests followed, eventually escalating to the Second Ivorian Civil War. Gbagbo’s control of the country's armed forces and the state media gradually crumbled under the weight of international sanctions and massive defections from the armed forces due to a successful military campaign by pro-Ouattara rebel forces. On 18 December, Gbagbo ordered peacekeeping forces from the United Nations and France to leave the country. The violence escalated in March 2011. On 10 March, Gbagbo banned French and UN aircraft from Ivorian airspace, but the UN continued to fly helicopters despite the order. On 30 March, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1975, calling for Gbagbo to step down, placing sanctions on Gbagbo and his associates, reaffirming the mandate of UNOCI to use all means necessary to protect civilians, and supporting Ouattara as President of Côte d’Ivoire. The resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria and France. French and UN forces began actively supporting pro-Ouattara forces. On 31 March, pro-Ouattara forces advanced on Abidjan from several directions. UNOCI said its headquarters were fired on by Gbabgo's special forces that day, and it returned fire in response. UNOCI took control of the Abidjan airport when Gbagbo's forces abandoned it. On 2 April, heavy fighting was reported around the Agban military base and the presidential palace. On 3 April 2011, French forces took direct action in the conflict by taking control of, and reopening, the Abidjan airport. This made it clear to the Gbagbo regime that France was a direct threat to its survival and triggered a crisis for Cote d’Ivoire. Hundreds of additional French troops landed in the Abidjan airport that same day. Cote d’Ivoire implemented its major response the next day: Gbagbo issued a vehement condemnation of France, calling it an “ugly colonist” that was planning a “Rwanda-style genocide,” and according to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-                                                                                                          moon, pro-Gbagbo forces attacked UN forces and headquarters in Abidjan. UN and French helicopters began firing on pro-Gbagbo military targets that day. On 5 April, pro-Ouattara forces announced that they had captured the presidential palace. On the same day, Gbagbo’s military chief called for a ceasefire. Following this, it was reported that fighting had ceased in Abidjan. That same day, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) promised a “safe and dignified” exit for Gbagbo and his family if he conceded the election and handed power over to Ouattara. However, negotiations failed and forces loyal to Ouattara moved to seize Gbagbo at his residence in Abidjan on 6 April. Within the next few days, pro-Gbagbo forces retaliated in Abidjan and took control of the Plateau and Cocody areas of the city. On 9 April, pro-Gbagbo forces fired on the Golf Hotel, where Ouattara was located. UN peacekeepers, mandated to protect Ouattara and other civilians, returned fire. Pro-Gbagbo forces also fired on other civilians and the UN base. In response to this series of events, UN and French forces carried out further air strikes the following day against Gbagbo's residence and the heavy weaponry of his supporting forces. The crisis terminated on 11 April 2011, when pro-Ouattara forces, supported by French forces, captured Gbagbo without harm. The actual capture was made by Ouattara's troops, but French forces assisted in the final assault with tanks and helicopters, the latter delivering rocket strikes. Ouattara became the undisputed President of Cote d’Ivoire. Following his arrest, Gbagbo and members of his family and entourage were placed under UN police guard at the Golf Hotel. Gbagbo was then extradited to the International Criminal Court. Both during and before the crisis, the AU and ECOWAS called on Gbagbo to step down and affirmed their view of Ouattara as the legitimate president of Cote d’Ivoire.
Tensions between the government of Sudan and southern Sudanese had existed since the time of Sudanese independence and focused on resources, religion, and the right to self-rule. A separatist movement emerged in southern Sudan in 1955, and tensions eventually escalated into a civil war between the Sudanese government and southern rebels. The Addis Ababa Agreement in 197 ended the civil war and granted significant autonomy to southern Sudan. However, the Sudanese government canceled these arrangements, and a second civil war began in 1983 that was led by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), a southern rebel group. Negotiations on the status of southern Sudan were abandoned when Omar al-Bashir took over in a military coup in 1989. The second civil war ended with the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and SPLM/A. This granted significant autonomy to southern Sudan and created a six-year interim period, at the end of which the South would be able to vote on secession via referendum. In March 2005, the United Nation Security Council established the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) peacekeeping mission, which was tasked with helping the parties implement the CPA. In 2009, the African Union High- Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) was established with a broad mandate to promote the resolution of conflict and democratization in Sudan, headed by former South African president Thabo Mbkei. PRE-CRISIS: On 9 January 2011, the people of southern Sudan voted for the creation of an independent South Sudan. Independence was set to go into effect on 9 July. The CPA also granted the people of Abyei, a disputed region claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan (Khartoum), the right to vote in this process in a separate referendum. The AUHIP tried to mediate the modalities of a referendum in Abyei but was unable to do so over disagreements about who counted as a registered voter in the region. In the following several months, a low-level rebellion against Sudan (Khartoum) began in Abyei. These rebels were supported by South Sudan. The unresolved status of Abyei became the most important source of continued conflict between southern and northern Sudan that did not end once South Sudan became an independent state. On 19 May 2011, a crisis began when several Sudanese troops taking part in a joint patrol in the disputed region of Abyei were killed in clashes with South Sudanese-aligned rebels. This triggered a crisis for Sudan. The most important part of Sudan’s major response occurred on 2 May, when it seized nearly the entirety of the Abyei region. This triggered a crisis for South Sudan, which was not yet an independent state. The most important part of South Sudan’s major response was to send its Vice President to Khartoum to negotiate on May 26. South Sudan also appealed to the international community to get Sudan out of Abyei, while it and South Sudanese- aligned rebels in the region continued to clash with Sudan. However, Sudanese troops remained in place. On 1 June, Sudan attempted to disarm all armed groups operating in Abyei, an act which constituted the remainder of Sudan’s major response to its perceived crisis trigger.                                                                                                         With the initial outbreak of crisis and hostilities, there was a flurry of mediation activity by the AUHIP, a continuation of the effort that it began prior to crisis outbreak. The United Nations also tried to get involved as a peacemaker in late May but was rebuffed by Sudan. Around this time, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon proposed a new peacekeeping mission to replace (UNMIS). After a month of escalating tensions, the African Union on 20 June managed to mediate an agreement in which both parties agreed to allow a new UN mission to monitor Abeyi. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi played a lead role in securing the agreement, including offering to supply peacekeepers for the proposed UN force. South Sudan officially became an independent state on 9 July. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as the United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNIFSA), was deployed later that same month. Ethiopian peacekeepers comprised the entirety of UNIFSA in its early stages. Tensions between Sudan and South Sudan decreased slightly for several months, though they remained at crisis level. Renewed fighting occurred in December 2011 with airstrikes conducted by Sudan. Sudan also imposed an embargo on South Sudanese oil transiting its territory. Fighting continued throughout 2012. The most severe fighting occurred near Heglig, a town in the Sudanese state of South Kordofan, in which Sudan managed to stall a large South Sudanese offensive aimed at capturing the town. In the meantime, negotiations continued with little progress. The AU Peace and Security Council gave the two sides a deadline of 2 August 2012 to reach an agreement and threatened that it would adopt a “final” proposal on the Abyei dispute and refer the issue to the UN Security Council if a deal was not reached by then. The deadline passed without an agreement. The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan met in Addis Abba under the auspices of the AU in early September, with the Mbeki-led AUHIP urging both of them to adopt previous frameworks to resolve the dispute. The AUHIP tried to get a deal on the status of Abyei, offering proposals for resolution that included a referendum. The AU Peace and Security Council even adopted another deadline of 22 September for the two sides to reach agreement, but it was not met as well. Sudan was steadfast in its determination to not allow a final resolution of the status of Abyei to occur or to promise a referendum without first getting guarantees that nomadic groups that pass through the region would also be included in the referendum. Recognizing that negotiations would likely fail if the focus remained on Abyei, the AUHIP shifted the discussions to peripheral issues such as oil and demilitarization of the two sides’ common border—issues on which they had reached agreement earlier in the crisis but had not followed through on implementation. An agreement on these peripheral issues was eventually reached on 27 September, mediated by the AUHIP. This terminated the crisis for both Sudan and South Sudan. The agreement did not resolve the status of Abyei, leaving the area still technically part of Sudanese territory but mostly unoccupied, with the exception of a marginal presence of Sudanese military “police.” By helping to bring about the final agreement that terminated the crisis, the AUHIP’s mediation effort had a minor positive effect on crisis abatement, particularly through its facilitative tactics                                                                                                   of bringing the parties together to talk. In addition to its role as a mediator, the AU adopted numerous resolutions demanding a cessation of hostilities during the crisis. The UN, United States, and European Union also made statements demanding that both sides end the fighting, allow humanitarian access to the region, and resolve the Abyei dispute. None of these statements had a discernible impact on the crisis proceedings. Intermittent clashes continued after the crisis terminated. The Mbeki-led AUHIP mediation effort aimed at resolving the Abyei issue continued as well.
The Philippines experienced a crisis with China over a standoff around the disputed Scarborough Shoal between 10 April 2012 and 15 June 2012. The Philippines was the only crisis actor, but China was also heavily involved as a disputant during the crisis. In addition, the United States played a significant role as a mediator. The Philippines and China have a long-running dispute over the status of the Scarborough Shoal and its surrounding waters. The status of the shoal is part of a larger regional dispute – also involving Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia – over various islands and waters in the South China Sea, a dispute that has escalated in recent years due in large part to increasing Chinese assertiveness regarding its sovereign claims. The dispute between the Philippines and China has been especially and persistently salient since 1995, when Chinese forces occupied Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands (see Case #414). Taiwan (Republic of China) also makes sovereign claims to the area around the Scarborough Shoal, but the Philippines and China have been the primary adversaries in the dispute over the shoal in recent years. Both China and the Philippines claim that the Scarborough Shoal is an integral part of their national territory. China refers to the shoal as Huangyan Island, claiming that it has “indisputable sovereignty” over the shoal and adjacent waters. The Philippines argues that Scarborough Shoal, which it refers to as Panatag Shoal, falls within its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and that the Philippines' sovereignty covers the rest of the resources within the EEZ and continental shelf. PRE-CRISIS: On 8 April 2012, a Philippine Air Force (PAF) reconnaissance plane spotted eight Chinese fishing vessels in the disputed waters around the Scarborough Shoal. In response, Philippines President Benigno Aquino III directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to step up its monitoring activities in line with its enforcement of the country’s fisheries and maritime environmental protections laws. That same day, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, a Philippine warship, was dispatched to the Scarborough Shoal. On 10 April, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar arrived in the area. Philippine sailors boarded the Chinese fishing vessels for an inspection and discovered that the vessels were conducting illegal fishing. The Philippine sailors then attempted to apprehend the crew of the fishing vessels. On 10 April, following the Philippine Navy’s boarding of the Chinese fishing vessels earlier in the day, two Chinese maritime surveillance ships arrived at the Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese surveillance ships placed themselves between the Chinese fishing vessels and the Philippine warship to protect the fishing vessels and prevent their crew from being arrested by the Philippine Navy. This triggered a crisis for the Philippines and a standoff between the two countries at the Scarborough Shoal. On 11 April, in an effort to lower the tension generated by the standoff, Philippine President Aquino decided to withdraw the BRP Gregorio del Pilar and replace it with a smaller coast                                                                                                        guard vessel. This constituted the Philippines’ major response to the crisis trigger. That same day, the Chinese foreign ministry announced that the Philippines’ attempt to carry out law enforcement activities had infringed upon China’s sovereignty. China also warned the Philippines “not to complicate and escalate the situation.” and urged it “to stop illegal activities” and leave the shoal. The following day, the Philippines coast guard vessel arrived to take the place of the BRP Gregorio del Pilar. On 17 April, the Philippines urged China to bring the dispute to the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). The Chinese foreign ministry rejected Manila’s proposal and instead insisted on bilateral diplomatic talks to solve the standoff. By the end of April, both sides admitted that their negotiations were deadlocked. The Chinese Embassy blamed Manila for the impasse and “for negotiating in bad faith by distorting the facts surrounding the standoff.” On 9 May, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying summoned the charge d’affaires at the Philippine Embassy in Beijing and warned the Philippine diplomat that China was finding it difficult to be optimistic about the situation because of the Philippines’ refusal to withdraw its coast guard vessels from the shoal. The following day, the Chinese General Administration of Quality Supervision announced that fruits from the Philippines were being held for quarantine concerns. Also, the China International Travel Service suspended all scheduled flights to the Philippines. On 13 May, in a surprise move, the US submarine USS North Carolina arrived at Subic Bay. While the US and Philippines indicated that the submarine was conducting a routine courtesy visit, it was interpreted as a move signaling to Beijing the strength of the defense commitment between the Philippines and the US. In mid-June, the US helped to broker an agreement between the Philippines and China following weeks of a backdoor mediation effort aimed at resolving the standoff. Conflicting reports exist as to when the mediation began, but it was either in May or early June. Kurt Campbell, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, was heavily involved in this mediation effort. Under the agreement, which contained concessions suggested by the US, China and the Philippines promised to withdraw their forces from the Scarborough Shoal until a deal over its ownership could be reached. On 15 June, Philippine President Aquino recalled all Philippine vessels from the shoal, terminating the crisis. US mediation contributed to the resolution of the crisis via the agreement with which the Philippines eventually complied, but the main reason that the Philippines withdrew its vessels was because of an upcoming typhoon. China did not perceive a crisis during the standoff over the Scarborough Shoal that lasted from April until June. It did not place its military on alert, and top political and military officials stressed a diplomatic approach to resolving the dispute. During the standoff, China attempted to protect its territorial sovereignty in an assertive manner while actively avoiding an escalation to military hostilities, sending maritime surveillance ships to deal with the standoff rather than naval vessels. Neither the United Nations nor any regional organizations were involved in the crisis. The Philippines asked ASEAN to get involved, and China and the Philippines met on the sideline of a 28-30 May ASEAN meeting and agreed to show restraint. But the issue was not discussed by ASEAN at that meeting, and ASEAN did not get involved in the crisis.                                                                                                        China did not abide by the US-brokered agreement that occurred toward the end of the crisis, and it maintained its presence at the Scarborough Shoal after the Philippines had withdrawn. The typhoon forced China to retrieve its civilian fishing vessels that were near the shoal on 18 June, but the Chinese maritime surveillance ships stayed near the area. Moreover, by July, China constructed a rope barrier across the mouth of the shoal, blocking Philippine access to it. China also placed naval vessels nearby the shoal in order to prevent the Philippines from attempting to break the barrier, effectively militarizing its presence in the shoal. In addition, in June 2014, Fu Ying, who had reportedly negotiated the June 2012 agreement for China with US mediator Kurt Campbell, denied the very existence of a US-brokered agreement for both sides to leave the Scarborough Shoal. On 29 October 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued a ruling that it has jurisdiction in the dispute between the Philippines and China and will hold hearings on the matter. In doing so, the Hague rejected China’s case that its claims in the South China Sea are indisputable and based on historical rights rather than legal precedent.
Turkey experienced a crisis with Syria between 3 October and 4 December 2012 that was precipitated by spillover military action from the Syrian Civil War. Turkey was the only crisis actor, but Syria was also heavily involved as Turkey’s adversary during the crisis. The United States was also involved in a notable way due to military support of Turkey, its NATO ally. Although Turkey-Syria relations have historically been positive, tensions had escalated since the start of Syria’s civil war in 2011. Turkey denounced Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s handling of the uprising, and Syria accused Turkey of supporting Syrian rebels. On 22 June 2012, Syria shot down a Turkish Air Force jet near the Turkish-Syrian border. The Syrian military alleged the jet had violated Syrian airspace. However, the Turkish Prime Minister and other spokespersons did not confirm the allegation and emphasized that brief incursions into neighboring airspace by high-speed jets are routine occurrences. The Turkish and Syrian navies conducted a search for the Turkish airmen downed by the incident. In August 2012, Turkey began to hold high-level meetings with the United States on plans to replace the Syrian government. On 3 October 2012, five Turkish civilians in the border town Akcakale were killed by mortar shells fired by Syrian government forces. This triggered a crisis for Turkey. Turkey’s major response consisted of at least twelve hours of cross-border artillery fire and a request of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) involvement in the crisis that same day, and the following day Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan requested and received approval from Turkey’s Parliament for additional cross-border raids. The US, NATO, and the UNSC quickly condemned Syria’s actions, but Erdogan criticized the UNSC for not doing more. Syria apologized over the incident, in part due to Russian pressure. But tensions between Turkey and Syria remained high. On 10 October, Turkey forced the landing of a passenger plane traveling from Moscow to Syria because the plane allegedly contained weapons. Russia denounced the move, and Syria responded by closing its airspace to Turkish planes on 13 October. Turkey retaliated in kind in the following days. Cross-border fire continued during the remainder of October and into November. As Syrian government and rebel forces battled for control of border towns, Turkey responded to any stray Syrian shelling with cross-border shelling of its own. Turkey refrained from any airstrikes, and casualties were low, although Ankara did send several fighter jets to the border on 8 November after Damascus launched an air attack against one of its own border towns. On 21 November, Turkey officially requested that NATO deploy Patriot missiles along the Turkey-Syria border. Turkey insisted that the missiles would be used for defense purposes only. NATO approved the request on 4 December, and the US agreed to send several of its own Patriot missiles as part of the NATO response. Turkey’s crisis faded after NATO approved the request.                                                                                                    NATO and the US had an important effect on crisis abatement via the decision to send missiles to Turkey. The missiles were delivered to Turkey after the crisis terminated, in early 2013. The UN’s involvement was ineffective.
Another crisis in the protracted conflict over North Korea’s nuclear program occurred from 1 February until 14 August 2013. The first crisis in this protracted conflict occurred in 1993 and ended with North Korea and the United States signing an agreement under which the former promised to freeze its nuclear program (see case #408). Almost a decade passed until the next North Korean nuclear crisis occurred in 2002, when it was definitively concluded that North Korea had begun a secret enrichment program (see case #441). Since then North Korea has ramped up its nuclear production and testing, and crises in this protracted conflict have become much more frequent, with one occurring every three or four years (see cases #450 and #459). Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States were the crisis actors in this fifth North Korean Nuclear crisis. These were the same four actors as in the previous crisis in this protracted conflict, which occurred in 2009 (case #459) and centered on the launch of a satellite and a nuclear test by North Korea. Separate from the issue of North Korea’s nuclear program, North Korea and South Korea had also experienced two crises in 2010 related to the sinking of the Cheonan vessel (case #461) and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (case #462). North Korea underwent a significant political change on 17 December 2011 when Kim Jong-il suddenly died. His son, Kim Jong-un, took over the North Korean Supreme Leader office shortly thereafter, on 24 December. Relations with the US and South Korea remained strained as the new North Korean leader went ahead with a series of long-range rocket tests in April and continued the same harsh rhetoric used by his father. PRE-CRISIS: In October 2012, North Korea announced that it had developed a missile capable of reaching the mainland US. In December, North Korea fired a long-range rocket to test space capabilities, drawing condemnation from the international community. In January 2013, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) voted to adopt Resolution 2087, which increased sanctions on the North Korean regime for its missile tests. In response, North Korea announced that it would conduct another nuclear test and promised to continue the development of its long-range missile program. On 12 February 2013 North Korea conducted a nuclear test, triggering a crisis for South Korea, the United States, and Japan. On that day, Japan called an emergency meeting of its security council and issued its major response, which consisted of public threats to impose a fresh round of unilateral sanctions on North Korea, and most importantly, the sending of planes to monitor radiation levels. Japan was particularly concerned with the nuclear issue and the related potential for an accident, having endured the Fukushima Power Plant nuclear disaster almost two years prior and having its airspace and nearby international waters repeatedly targeted by North Korean missile tests in recent times. Also on that day, the US was reportedly in close consultation with South Korea about security issues.                                                                                                      On 13 February, South Korea implemented the most important part of its major response to the crisis trigger by staging large-scale joint military drills with the United States. Some of these drills were regularly scheduled but others were conducted specifically in response to the crisis trigger. US participation in these drills involved troops it had already stationed in South Korea. The following day, South Korea conducted the remainder of its major response: it unveiled a new cruise missile which was capable of striking anywhere in North Korea, deployed destroyers and submarines off its eastern coast, and officially condemned the nuclear test via a parliamentary resolution and a statement from the defense minister. Shortly after the crisis began, discussions about further UNSC sanctions against North Korea commenced. The US and China took the lead in engineering these sanctions. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe voiced his support for UN sanctions when he met with US President Obama on 22 February. South Korea also pushed for UN sanctions. On 7 March, with unanimous support of all members, the UNSC adopted Resolution 2094, ordering more sanctions against North Korea. This triggered a crisis for North Korea. Voting to adopt these sanctions was the most important part of the American major response to the crisis trigger. The day after the sanctions were ordered, North and South Korea exchanged the highest level of “hostile warnings” that they had in years. On 11 March, North Korea verbally nullified the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement between itself and South Korea. This move was North Korea’s major response to its crisis trigger. On 15 March, the US bolstered its ballistic missile protection system on the Pacific Coast. On 27 March, North Korea shut down lines of communication with South Korea. The next day, the US and South Korea flew bombers over the Korean peninsula in a yearly military exercise that had been regularly scheduled but that had been expanded into a much larger exercise in the aftermath of the nuclear test. On 2 April, North Korea threatened to restart the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. That same day, the US sent a missile defense system to Guam. On 5 April, North Korea advised countries to evacuate their embassies in Pyongyang. On 8 April, in what would become a major focus of the crisis, North Korea pulled its workers out of factories in the southern Kaesong Industrial Region, shutting the factories down. This was notable because the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is a joint venture between North and South Korea and one of the only mechanisms via which the two countries have cooperated during the 2000s. It also marked a turning point in the crisis, as the primary issue soon shifted from the nuclear test to economic concerns between the two Koreas related to the KIC and its operation. The following day, North Korea warned that it was on the brink of war. After this escalation, South Korea called for talks to defuse tensions on 11 April, but North Korea refused to participate. On 25 April, South Korea proposed talks once more and threatened to take a “grave measure” with regard to the KIC if North Korea did not agree to hold talks. The following day, North Korea rejected the proposal to hold talks again, and South Korea announced that it was pulling its remaining workers from the KIC. On 3 May, the final South Korean workers left the KIC, effectively closing the KIC (albeit unofficially) for the first time since it opened in 2003. On 18 May, North Korea launched a missile, raising tensions further.                                                                                                      On 25 May, China pressured North Korea to return to talks and cease escalation of the situation. On 6 June, North Korea announced that it would return to talks, and the following day it restored communications with South Korea. These initial plans to hold talks collapsed due to a disagreement between the two sides over the rank of negotiators. South Korea and North Korea eventually met on 7 July and came to an agreement on the principles of reopening the KIC. Negotiations continued, and on 28 July, South Korea pledged $7.3 million in humanitarian aid for North Korea and called for “one last round” of make-or-break talks. North Korea continued to drag its feet in these negotiations. On 7 August, the South Korean government began the process of reviewing insurance claims to South Korean businesses that lost revenue due to the closing of the KIC, which was seen as the first step toward officially closing the KIC. Within 90 minutes of South Korea announcing that it was conducting this review, North Korea declared that it was committed to reopening Kaesong and proposed another round of talks on the matter. North Korea was hurting economically from the closure of the KIC, to a much greater degree than South Korea, as well as from UN sanctions. Talks re-commenced soon thereafter and resulted in an agreement on the reopening of the KIC, signed by North and South Korea on 14 August. This marked an end to the heightened level of tensions and terminated the crisis for all parties. As part of this agreement North Korea agreed to allow foreign investors into the KIC and adhere to “international business standards” that included allowing Internet and mobile phone access for South Korean factory managers. The two sides also agreed to no more unilateral closures of the KIC and the setting up of a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies for losses incurred due to the closure of the KIC. The nuclear issue remained unresolved. Nevertheless, South Korea, the US, and Japan were satisfied to have relations between the two Koreas return to the status quo. The UN was involved in the crisis through the Security Council’s imposition of sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions initially escalated tensions between the actors but ultimately contributed somewhat to bringing North Korea to the table. Russia was minimally involved in the crisis: it condemned North Korea while also warning South Korea, the US, and Japan to not get involved. On 7 April 2013, Switzerland indicated that it had recently been in contact with North Korean authorities and made an offer to mediate. However, mediation did not occur.
A crisis involving the United States and Syria occurred between 21 August and 21 September 2013 against the backdrop of the Syrian Civil War. Almost one year prior to the day that the crisis began – on 20 August 2012 – US President Barack Obama stated that chemical weapons use in the Syrian Civil War would be a “red line” for the US government that would change his calculus about US involvement in the war. The first allegations of chemical weapons usage in the war emerged in December 2012. Between that time and the outbreak of the crisis, both the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad and opposition forces alleged that the other had used chemical weapons in a number of different attacks. These alleged attacks were small scale, and the evidence regarding their occurrence was ambiguous. In March 2013, the Syrian government asked the United Nations to conduct an investigation into the use of chemical weapons by the opposition. At the same time, France and the United Kingdom asked the UN to conduct an investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria in general. In response to the invitation from the Syrian government, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon established a fact-finding mission on 21 March to investigate the allegations of chemical weapons usage. This mission, known as the UN Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, also involved representatives of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Health Organization (WHO). In April 2013, the White House indicated that US intelligence was assessing “with varying degrees of confidence” the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, but that the assessment was uncertain and that investigations were still ongoing. PRE-CRISIS: Inspectors from the UN Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic arrived in Syria on 18 August 2013, three days before the attack that triggered the crisis. On 21 August 2013, videos surfaced of a mass chemical weapons attack against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, perpetrated by the Syrian regime. This attack was distinguished from the alleged ones that came before it by its scale and its verifiability: thousands were affected, videos of the attack surfaced immediately, and there was consensus among international intelligence entities that the Assad regime was culpable. This triggered a crisis for the US, which was concerned about its status and influence in the region, given that this attack was the first undisputed case of chemical weapons usage by the Assad regime that occurred after Obama gave his “red line” speech a year earlier. The US was particularly concerned about the negative repercussions that not responding would have on countries like Syria and Iran, who might be more likely to challenge the US in the future. President Obama stated that “this is a big event, of grave concern,” and the Obama administration initiated the first part of its major response by starting to reach out to dozens of its international counterparts. France and the UK were particularly involved: France argued strongly for a military response and released a declassified intelligence report that helped build the case against Syria. The UK called an emergency meeting                                                                                                     of the UN Security Council (UNSC) on the day of the crisis trigger and initially moved to introduce a UNSC resolution authorizing the use of force, until the UK Parliament voted to not support such involvement. The UNSC met on 21 August, discussed the issue, and demanded further clarity about the incident. On 24 August, the US moved naval warships into the Mediterranean Sea in a show of force, the second part of its major response. This signaled to the Syrian regime that the US was serious about its threat of force and triggered a crisis for Syria. Syria’s major response occurred the following day and consisted of agreeing to allow UN inspectors access to the site of the alleged attack in order to investigate, as well as Assad vehemently denying that his government was responsible for the attack and blaming the Syrian rebels instead. The crisis continued to escalate, though, and on 28 August, President Obama announced that the U.S. had conclusive evidence of the Assad regime’s guilt. The following day, the UK released an intelligence report confirming Obama’s allegations. The US released its own declassified report on 30 August. Then, on 31 August, Obama announced that he would seek Congressional authorization for the use of force against Syria, the third and most important part of the US’ major response to the crisis trigger. On 1 September, the Arab League issued a resolution urging international action against the Syrian regime over its use of chemical weapons but stopping short of endorsing US military strikes. On 9 September, Russia announced a proposal to avoid further conflict: if Syria agreed to dismantle its chemical weapons and place them under international control, the US would forgo a military strike. The US agreed to consider the proposal, and so did Syria. Over the next several days, the US and Russia worked together to draft a full proposal, and Obama postponed any Congressional vote on the authorization of force. Russia and the US announced a finalized plan to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles, known as the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons, on 14 September. On 21 September, Syria started to comply with the US-Russian Framework by submitting a declaration of its chemical weapons stockpiles and agreeing to give them up. This terminated the crisis for both sides. Throughout the crisis, the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) was the most involved of all UN bodies. The UNSG conducted a fact finding mission that helped put international pressure on the Syrian government, and in doing so the UNSG played a minor positive role in helping to abate the crisis. During the crisis, the UNSC was restricted to holding several emergency meetings, working toward a resolution, and issuing two statements, including a UNSC Presidential statement condemning the chemical weapons attack. The UNSC worked hard to come up with a resolution during the crisis but was unable to reach agreement and issue one until after the crisis had terminated. Russia opposed a proposed US military strike, blamed Syrian rebels for the Ghouta attack, and claimed that the evidence implicating the Assad regime was fabricated. But it nevertheless played an important role in helping to deescalate the crisis by working with the US to reach the Framework agreement with which Syria ultimately complied. The Arab League and NATO                                                                                                     condemned the chemical weapons attack and spoke with US Secretary of State John Kerry about the situation, and the Arab League also issued a call for international action against the Syrian regime. Neither of these organizations’ involvement had much effect on the crisis proceedings. The OPCW was heavily involved working before and during the crisis as a constituent part of the UN fact-finding mission, as well as after the crisis in terms of setting guidelines for the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons and monitoring the weapons destruction process alongside the UN. One week after the crisis terminated, on 27 September, the Executive Council of the OPCW adopted and added further benchmarks and timelines to the US-Russian Framework agreement. Later that same day, the UNSC issued a resolution endorsing a timeline for destroying Syria's chemical weapons and indicating that if Syria failed to comply, the UNSC would debate and seek agreement on a follow-up resolution spelling out punitive measures, including the possibility of Chapter VII measures. The resolution legally bound Syria to the plan approved by the OPCW and essentially implemented the US-Russia Framework agreement. According to the UNSC resolution, Syria had until mid-2014 to eliminate its chemical weapons. In mid-2014, the OPCW indicated that the destruction of these weapons was largely on schedule despite some hiccups. In July 2015, the OPCW reported successful destruction of over 90% of the weapons that were supposed to have been eliminated. However, accusations emerged that Assad has used chlorine gas in several attacks during 2015. Chlorine gas was not included in the UNSC resolution or OPCW plan, but it is on the Chemical Weapons Convention banned list.
A crisis occurred between Russia and Ukraine from 22 February 2014 to 18 February 2015. The crisis had important and broad implications for Russian relations with Ukraine, other former Soviet states in the region, and members of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including the United States. PRE-CRISIS: On 21 November 2013, Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych sparked a wave of anti- government unrest – commonly known as “Euromaidan” – when he rejected a trade and political association agreement with the EU in favor of forging closer ties to Russia. Demonstrations in favor of closer European integration began in Kiev that evening and were initially peaceful, but they eventually spread to other parts of Ukraine and escalated into a series of increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as demands for the resignation of Yanukovych. Violence between protestors and police reached its peak in mid-February 2014, when both sides were firing at each other and the number of deaths increased significantly. Alarmed by the escalating use of repression by the Ukrainian government, the United States imposed visa bans on twenty senior Ukrainian governmental officials on 19 February. The EU followed suit the next day with its own package of sanctions that included travel bans and asset freezes targeted at Ukrainian officials as well as a ban on the export of equipment that could be used for repression by the Ukrainian government. Over the next several days, a number of MPs from the ruling party in Ukraine (the Party of Regions), the armed forces, and police resigned and/or defected to the opposition or fled to safe areas. Faced with a Ukrainian Parliament that was now dominated by the political opposition, Yanukovych was pressured into signing an EU-mediated agreement on 21 February to try and end the political and civil crisis in Ukraine. This diplomatic move was all for naught, as Yanukovych fled Kiev for eastern Ukraine later that night, and Parliament voted to remove him from office the following day. The opposition took over the Ukrainian government, and Maidan protestors captured the presidential palace and took control of Kiev. The removal of Yanukovych on 22 February 2014 sparked a crisis for Russia. Russia feared that Ukraine would leave its sphere of influence and become a NATO ally. Russia also expressed concerns about the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine, particularly in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Crimea, where pro-Moscow protesters were calling for Crimea to secede from Ukraine. Russian officials met the night of 22 February and into the morning of February 23, when it was decided that Crimea should be retaken and Yanukovych should be extracted from Ukraine. This constituted Russia’s major response to its crisis. Yanukovych showed up in Moscow on 26 February after leaving Ukraine with Russian assistance. On 27-28 February, unidentified soldiers (widely suspected, and later confirmed to have been Russian special forces) seized several government buildings and airports in Crimea, sparking a crisis for Ukraine. Ukraine’s major response to its crisis was verbal and began on 27 February, when it sent a note to Russia demanding that Russian troops stay on base in Crimea, called for calm, and discussed the                                                                                                      situation with Russia. The following day, Ukraine called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the final part of its major response. On 1 March, the Russian Parliament gave President Vladimir Putin permission to use force in Crimea, and Russia launched a full-scale military intervention in the country that day. The move was met with little resistance from Ukraine, which was advised by the U.S. to avoid a military confrontation with Russia. Crimea was formally annexed on 18 March, following a local referendum two days earlier in which 97% of voters supported joining Russia. Non-violent military confrontations in Crimea continued until 25 March, when Ukraine withdrew completely from the region. In the meantime, tensions also began to simmer between Ukraine and Russia in eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian protests in the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass region in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Crimea was annexed. At some point soon thereafter, Russia began to conduct military exercises in Rostov and other points near its border with eastern Ukraine, and it also began massing troops in the area, all with the intent to try and force Ukraine to back down in Donbass without having to resort to violence. Ukraine beefed up security at border checkpoints, citing fears that Russian troops may invade. Russia removed some of its forces from Rostov on 31 March after a conversation between the U.S. and Russian foreign ministers. Pro-Russian militants in Donbass took control of several government buildings on April 7 and later declared independence from Ukraine – in the form of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) – following referenda. This set off a war between Ukrainian security forces and pro-Russian militias in Donbass, supported by Russian arms and widely suspected to have included Russian military members. Ukraine responded to the initial events in Donbass with force. On 14 April, acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov announced an anti-terror operation against pro-Russian separatists, although it was short-lived. On 22 April, Turchynov ordered more military operations against pro-Russian militants. Despite publicly denying an interest in intervening in Donbass, Russia increased its troop presence along Ukraine’s southeastern border and began another series of military exercises on 23 April, raising concerns that it might conduct a full- fledged military intervention in Donbass if Ukraine appeared to be winning the conflict. Russia and Ukraine were involved in a simultaneous dispute over the latter’s natural gas debt to the former. Gazprom, one of Russia’s largest oil companies, was demanding advance payments for natural gas until Ukraine paid off its debts. Ukraine perceived this as a Russian political maneuver related to the larger security and territorial issues at stake in the crisis. In May, the European Union (EU) Energy Commissioner began talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to sort out a repayment plan that would keep the gas from being cut off. The Ukrainian pipelines also supply Europe, so there was a shared interest in resolving the debt dispute. On 15 June, talks over Ukraine’s natural gas debt broke down. Russia cut the natural gas pipeline to Ukraine the following day. This move placed additional time pressure on Ukraine to resolve the crisis sooner. On 17 July, pro-Russian militants mistakenly shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a passenger plane that was flying over Donbass, with a Russian-made Buk anti-aircraft missile. The incident                                                                                                      garnered significant international media attention and engendered widespread condemnation and outrage but did not slow the pace of fighting in the region. In August, after a Ukrainian counter- offensive regained control of several cities and villages in Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian troops intervened openly in the conflict, sending tanks and missiles across the Ukrainian border. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) established a Trilateral Contact Group with Ukraine and Russia in June, initiating a mediation effort between the two sides. Separatist leaders from the DPR and LPR were also brought into the process. The OSCE brokered a ceasefire, the Minsk Protocol, between all sides on 5 September. The ceasefire failed to hold, and the fighting continued largely unabated through 2014, albeit at a lower level than before Minsk I. On 30 October, Russia and Ukraine agreed to a natural gas supply deal. Fighting escalated to pre-Minsk I levels again in January 2015. Pro-Russian rebels took control of the Donetsk airport on 15 January, signaling the full collapse of the Minsk Protocol. Around this time, DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that he had no interest in peace talks and pledged to begin trying to move the front line. In February 2015, a renewed round of talks occurred, this time initiated and led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Merkel and Hollande mediated direct negotiations between Putin and new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, but also coordinated closely with the OSCE, which focused on renewed mediation efforts under the Trilateral Contact Group and securing the cooperation of the DPR and LPR. On 6 February, Merkel and Hollande met privately with Putin for several hours, convincing him to return to the table. The mediation effort officially began the following day, when Russian, Ukrainian, and separatist leaders met for negotiations hosted by the OSCE. France and Germany threatened new sanctions if a deal wasn't reached, and the OSCE promised to monitor the implementation of an agreement if one was reached. The mediation effort resulted in a second ceasefire agreement between all sides, commonly known as Minsk II, on 12 February. The ceasefire was scheduled to take effect on 15 February. Fighting mostly ceased after the signing of this agreement, but some clashes continued for a short time afterward in the city of Debaltseve, ending after rebels retook the city on 18 February. Russian military advisors coordinated the assault on Debaltseve, and U.S. sources were confident that the shelling and rocket attacks in the area came from the Russian military. Ukraine’s retreat from Debaltseve under fire terminated the crisis for both Ukraine and Russia. In response to the events in Crimea, the U.S. advised Ukraine to not engage Russia militarily but also imposed economic sanctions on Russia. The sanctions were widely viewed as ineffective. In addition, the U.S. provided funds, military training, and military equipment – not including weapons – to Ukraine during the crisis. The UN was involved in the crisis in several different capacities. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution condemning the Russian annexation of Crimea. The UNSC adopted a resolution on 21 July 2014 condemning the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight, and another resolution on 17 February 2015 endorsing Minsk II. The UNSC made several                                                                                                        attempts to pass a resolution condemning the referendum in and annexation of Crimea, but Russia repeatedly vetoed those efforts. The UN was also involved in the areas of human rights and refugee assistance. UN activity had little effect on the crisis proceedings. Several regional organizations were involved in the crisis. In addition to its role as mediator, the OSCE deployed an observer group that monitored compliance with both Minsk ceasefire agreements and facilitated dialogue between local communities in eastern Ukraine, including between local residents and internally-displaced persons. In addition to its role in the natural gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia, the EU imposed several rounds of economic sanctions on Russia, first in March 2014 and then again in July and September 2014. The G8 suspended Russia’s membership on 24 March 2014. NATO became involved after Ukraine approached it shortly after Yanukovych was ousted. In February 2014, the secretary general of NATO reiterated the organization's commitment to a 2008 declaration endorsing a path to NATO membership for Ukraine, provided that Ukraine met certain criteria. On 1 April 2014, NATO suspended civil and military cooperation with Russia. NATO also participated in general capacity-building in Ukraine, issued statements on the situation in Ukraine, and conducted limited military exercises, generally viewed as a means of reassuring local allies. Russia accused NATO of being involved in a more substantial manner militarily, but there was no evidence to support that accusation, and NATO avoided direct military intervention. In the aftermath of Minsk II, the situation in Donbass remained more or less stalemated, though all sides made some limited progress in complying and implementing the agreement during the remainder of 2015. The OSCE monitored the implementation of Minsk II.
A crisis occurred between China and Vietnam from 2 May to 16 July 2014 over the placement of a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel Islands. The crisis occurred within the context of a long- standing dispute between Vietnam and China over competing claims to waters and various islands and reefs in the South China Sea (the two states previously fought a naval battle over the Spratly Islands in 1988; see Case #384). It also occurred against a backdrop of increasing and broader regional tension due to Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea (e.g., the Philippines experienced a crisis with China two years earlier over the Scarborough Shoal; see Case #467). The Paracel Islands are located within Vietnam’s 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). China also claims historical sovereignty over the islands and its surrounding waters. China has administered the Paracel Islands exclusively since 1974, when it occupied the islands militarily. In 1996, China drew baselines around the Paracel Islands and two years later passed a law claiming a 200-mile EEZ from these baselines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Taiwan (Republic of China) also claims sovereignty over the Paracel Islands and surrounding areas. On 2 May 2014, China deployed a state-owned oil rig – HD-981 – roughly 17 nautical miles south of Triton Island, the southwestern-most island in the Paracel archipelago. This location was about 120 nautical miles east of Vietnam’s coast and 180 nautical miles south of China’s Hainan Island. The oil rig was accompanied by Chinese Coast Guard ships and up to 80 Chinese commercial and fishing ships, which promptly created three security cordons, establishing a three-nautical-mile security radius around the rig – exceeding the 500 meter zone allowed for by UNCLOS. The deployment of the oil rig and accompanying ships triggered a crisis for Vietnam, which viewed the location of the rig as part of its EEZ. China claimed that the rig was in its own EEZ and announced that a drilling operation would occur from 4 May to 15 August 2014. Vietnam’s major response occurred on 2 May and consisted mainly of dispatching coast guard ships to the area. This triggered a crisis for China. China’s major response occurred that same day, mainly via a notice from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese embassy, requesting removal of Vietnamese vessels from the area of the rig’s operations. The remainder of Vietnam’s and China’s major responses consisted of two meetings held that same day in which both sides reiterated their claim to the waters and no agreement was reached. On 4 May, after Vietnamese ships tried to break the security cordon, Chinese Coast Guard and Vietnamese ships rammed and shot water cannons at each other. Neither side backed down, and the standoff continued for two months, with intermittent clashes and intentional ship ramming. Several times during this period, Vietnamese ships approached Chinese ships and demanded that they leave, and Chinese ships chased the Vietnamese ships back to shore. On 3 June, China arrested six Vietnamese fishermen. At some point, Chinese PLAN (People’s Liberation Army Navy) ships, along with fighter jets, helicopters, and reconnaissance aircraft, were deployed to patrol the area. The PLAN ships served as a protective ring around the Chinese vessels that were                                                                                                      closer to the rig and interacting with the Vietnamese ships. The Vietnam Coast Guard also reported that China deployed anti-aircraft missiles to the oil rig. From 11 to 14 May, anti-Chinese protests occurred in Vietnam and resulted in at least two Chinese deaths and over 100 injured. Chinese factories were damaged. More than 3,000 Chinese nationals were evacuated from Vietnam from 17-19 May. China unexpectedly removed the oil rig on 16 July, one month earlier than originally planned. China claimed that its exploration of the oil field was complete and that it would be making plans for its next actions, as per normal business operations. It also cited the approaching typhoon season as a reason for removing the oil rig earlier than expected. The removal of the rig concluded the crisis for both sides. Both sides filed multiple complaints with the UN Secretary-General (UNSG). In a 9 June appeal to the UNSG, China asked that its appeal be shared with the General Assembly. In response, the UNSG issued a statement on 11 June calling for action to resolve the dispute and offering to mediate via its good offices. This mediation offer was not accepted by either side. ASEAN made a statement on 10 May 2014 calling for full implementation of the 200 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) between ASEAN and China, in order to build trust between the parties and prevent such disputes from escalating to violence again in the future. The statement appeared to imply that China bore the onus of responsibility for implementing the agreement, and China expressed concern over the statement. United States involvement in the crisis was limited to political statements, mostly condemning China’s actions as provocative and destabilizing. Despite the removal of the rig, the overall issue of competing Chinese and Vietnamese claims to the area remained unresolved. The oil rig was moved in the direction of the contested waters again in late June 2015. In addition, Vietnam protested that the rig was in disputed waters in late January and again in early April 2016. In both cases, the rig was in overlapping claimed EEZs but closer to China than during the crisis.
India and Pakistan experienced a crisis resulting from a series of escalating ceasefire violations along the Line of Control separating the Pakistani- and Indian-controlled portions of the Kashmir region. The crisis began on 6 October 2014, and faded sometime in the later part of that month. India and Pakistan have been involved in a protracted conflict, including several wars, over the disputed Kashmir region since 1947. In 2003, both states agreed to a ceasefire, though intermittent exchanges of fire continued. Relations between India and Pakistan experienced a brief thaw in early 2014, following the election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PRE-CRISIS: Tensions between the two countries increased in August 2014 after India canceled talks with Islamabad, citing objections to Pakistan’s meeting with Kashmiri separatists. Around the same time, exchanges of gun and mortar fire along the Line of Control began to escalate. These clashes escalated further beginning sometime during the first three days of October. Escalating clashes along the Line of Control culminated in heightened attacks during the first night of the Muslim holiday of Ed al-Adha on 6 October 2014, triggering a crisis for both India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan both reported civilian casualties that day for the first time since violence began to increase in August, although there were conflicting reports of Pakistani civilian deaths a day earlier. Both sides initiated their major responses to the crisis on the same day as the crisis trigger. Indian troops retaliated with mortar fire. Pakistan also responded with violence, but its most important response consisted of the Pakistani foreign office lodging a protest through diplomatic channels that same day. Officials of the Directorates General of Military Operations (DGMOs) from Pakistan and India discussed the ceasefire violations via a hotline on 7 October, but failed to resolve the issue. The following day Pakistan implemented the final part of its major response to the trigger when it requested that the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) deploy to the area where the fighting was occurring. In response to this request, UNMOGIP sent observers to the Pakistani areas hit by shelling on 14 October. Each country issued public statements blaming the other for initiating the hostilities, and India charged that Pakistan was using gunfire to provide cover for Kashmiri militants crossing the border into India. Within each state, top officials met several times throughout the crisis. Both countries continued to exchange fire along the Line of Control and Working Boundaries through much of October. The violence that occurred during the crisis was described as the worst fighting since the 2003 ceasefire. Both sides’ crises gradually faded in late October to early November as violence and hostile rhetoric decreased significantly. Shelling and firing continued across the Line of Control even after the crisis faded and into 2015, but by that point the armed exchanges were at normal levels, with each tracking and condemning perceived ceasefire violations.                                                                                                      Besides UNMOGIP’s presence in the area, there was little external involvement in the crisis. Pakistan attempted to get the UN more involved, but India remained resistant to any efforts to “internationalize” the issue throughout the crisis. There was no mediation in the crisis. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement on October 9, urging both sides to resolve the issue through dialogue, but he also indicated that the UN would not intervene directly through its good offices to resolve the crisis. There was no regional organization activity in the crisis, and neither the United States nor Russia got involved. Violence between the two sides increased again in summer 2015. India and Pakistan renewed their commitment to the ceasefire in September of that year. This was followed by additional meetings and discussion between the two states, which had been off the table during the crisis and prior to the September 2015 ceasefire agreement.
Another crisis in the extended protracted conflict between South Korea and North Korea began in early August 2015 with the explosion of a land mine on the southern side of the Military Demarcation line (MDL). The crisis ended on 25 August 2015. PRE-CRISIS: In the months leading up to the crisis, tension between North and South Korea began increasing due to military exercises conducted by both parties. In March 2015, North Korea conducted live- fire ballistic missile and surface-to-air missile exercises. At the same time, South Korea conducted annual joint military training exercises with the United States, to which Kim Jong-un called for “full combat readiness” in response. In April and May, North Korea conducted a number of military tests, including test-fires of anti-ship and air defense missiles, submarine- launched ballistic missiles, and live-fire artillery exercises near the Northern Limit Line (NLL), while South Korea conducted live-fire missile exercises in the Sea of Japan and a two-day coast guard defense drill. On 20 May, North Korea announced the ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons. Shortly afterward, the U.S. and South Korea participated in two combined anti- submarine warfare drills and a joint military logistics exercise. On 3 June, South Korea tested a 500km range ballistic missile, capable of striking anywhere in North Korean territory. Tensions also spilled over into low-level confrontations between the two states. On 30 June, South Korea fired warning shots at a North Korean vessel that had crossed into international waters. On 11 July, approximately ten North Korean soldiers crossed the MDL, but returned north after South Korea fired warning shots. On 4 August 2015, three land mines detonated south of the MDL, seriously injuring two South Korean soldiers. South Korean officials did not initially blame North Korea for the blasts, instead indicating that recent heavy rains may have caused mines planted long ago to shift. The following day, South Korea launched a joint investigation with the U.S. and the U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea into the incident. At some point over the next five days, the investigation discovered that North Korea was responsible for deliberately placing the mines and ruled out the possibility that the mines had drifted as a result of shifting soil due to storms. This triggered a crisis for South Korea. On 10 August, the investigation published its findings and charged the North Korean army with purposely placing the mines with the intention of killing South Korean soldiers. The investigation concluded that the mines were likely planted sometime after 22 July, which was the last time that South Korean patrols had gone through the gate near where the incident occurred. That same day, South Korea resumed the broadcasting of anti-North Korean propaganda over loudspeakers at the border. This constituted South Korea’s major response to the crisis and in turn triggered a crisis for North Korea. On 11 August, Seoul demanded that Pyongyang apologize for the land mine incident and punish those responsible. On 14 August, North Korea denied planting the mines, and the following day                                                                                                        threatened to use military strikes against the loudspeakers if the broadcasts were not stopped. On 17 August, North Korea resumed propaganda broadcasting across the border via loudspeaker as well, which constituted its major response to the crisis. That same day, South Korea and the U.S. began another round of joint military exercises. On 20 August, there was an exchange of artillery fire between North and South Korea, after reports that North Korea had fired shells into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). There was no damage, and no casualties were reported. North Korea denied claims that it had fired the shells and reiterated its threat of military operations if the South Korean broadcasts did not stop. At this point, North Korean troops were ordered to a semi-wartime alert, and South Korea ordered the evacuation of over 10,000 citizens living close to the DMZ. On 22 August, North Korea deployed submarines and mobilized artillery units along the border. Despite this, North and South Korea agreed to emergency talks that same day, and the talks began later that evening. On 25 August, North and South Korea reached an agreement and released a joint statement wherein North Korea expressed regret over the soldiers injured by the mines and ended its state of semi-wartime alert, while South Korea ceased the anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts. This terminated the crisis for both sides. In addition to its role as part of the fact-finding mission, the U.S. released statements in support of South Korea and reiterating its commitment to South Korea’s security and their alliance.
Turkey, Russia, and several North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members experienced a crisis precipitated by Ankara’s downing of a Russian Su-24 fighter jet that violated Turkish airspace on 24 November 2015. The crisis terminated on 29 June 2016. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, relations between Russia and NATO members were largely cordial, though not without incident. Minor tensions arose at various points during the 2000s due to NATO expansion, Russia’s invasion of Georgia, and potential United States anti-missile deployments in Europe. Russia’s bilateral relations with Turkey had grown relatively strong, with a robust trading partnership and bilateral agreements on issues ranging from visa-free travel to energy production and transport. Relations between Russia and the Turkey-NATO bloc soured beginning in 2011 as they took opposing positions in the Syrian civil war. The U.S., Turkey, and many NATO members began calling for Assad’s departure when he responded harshly to peaceful protests in 2011 and eventually began providing support to rebel groups fighting the regime. Russia strongly supported its long-standing ally and used its veto power to prevent any United Nations Security Council (UNSC) action against Damascus. In December 2012, NATO agreed to deploy Patriot missile systems along the Turkey-Syria border at Turkey’s request, following a series of border incidents between the two states (see Case #468). The U.S. and Germany supplied the missile systems, which were scheduled to remain in Turkey for three years. Tensions between Moscow and the NATO bloc reached their highest point since the Cold War in early 2014 when Russia semi-covertly invaded the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine (see Case # 471). Russia also began testing NATO military preparedness by provocatively violating members’ airspace and territorial waters, particularly in Eastern and Northern Europe. The U.S. and a collection of countries, including many NATO members, began bombing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria in late summer 2014, around the same time that tensions began to rise in Europe. PRE-CRISIS: Russia joined the Syrian conflict on 30 September 2015, bombing both designated terrorist groups such as ISIL and Western-backed rebels in Syria. Although the U.S. and Russia claimed to be communicating to avoid any mishaps or misinterpretation of intentions in Syria, Russia violated Turkish airspace on several occasions. After several unproductive meetings with Russian officials about these violations and Russia’s bombing of ethnic Turkmen Syrians that were fighting Assad, Ankara determined that the threat posed by additional airspace violations required a strong response. On 24 November 2015, a Russian Su-24 fighter jet violated Turkish airspace over the Hatay Province for a total of 17 seconds, triggering a crisis for Turkey. Turkish authorities attempted to                                                                                                      warn the jet a total of ten times over five minutes prior to the violation without any response from the plane. Turkey deployed F-16 fighter jets and shot down the Russian plane, an act that doubled as Turkey’s major response and the crisis trigger for Russia. Both pilots ejected and the jet crashed on the Syrian side of the border. One pilot was killed by anti-Assad militants and the other was recovered by Syrian and Russian special forces. A Russian helicopter was also shot down during the rescue mission, killing one Russian marine. Ankara stated it was defending its airspace and immediately contacted its NATO allies to discuss the incident and gain reassurances of support, and it also delivered a letter to the UNSC presenting its account of the events. That same day, Russia denied the plane ever received a warning and insisted it never entered Turkish airspace. Russia also promised “significant consequences,” which constituted the most important part of its major response to the crisis. The downing of the jet also initiated crises for several NATO members—the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Denmark. These five states had already committed or were soon to commit military personnel to direct involvement in the Syrian theater, and therefore feared that any escalation could draw them into potentially lethal conflict with Russia due to their Article V commitments of mutual defense. Their major responses occurred on 2 November. That day, NATO began a two-day emergency meeting at Ankara’s request. The NATO Secretary General, U.S. President Obama, French President Hollande, German Chancellor Merkel, and U.K. Prime Minister Cameron all defended Turkey’s right to defend its airspace, spoke with Turkish leaders, and called for calm and communication between Moscow and Ankara. NATO also stated that its members’ assessments supported Turkey’s account of the jet downing incident. On 25 November, Russia implemented the remainder of its major response: deploying air- defense assets (advanced S-400 missile systems to its air base in Syria’s Latakia province and a warship to the eastern Mediterranean Sea), bombing Turkmen militias in northern Syria close to the site where the jet was downed in support of Kurdish fighters, breaking military ties with Ankara, cancelling a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and discouraging Russian citizens from traveling to Turkey. Despite the bevy of responses, Russia declared that same day that it had no intent of going to war with Turkey, thereby terminating Russia’s crisis. Tensions nonetheless continued to increase under an uncertain threat of Russian reprisal. On 28 November, Russia imposed sanctions targeting Turkish workers, goods, and tourism. That same day, Ankara announced the deployment of advanced jamming equipment to southern Turkey to counter the earlier deployment of Russian air-defense systems. Around this time, the leaders of some NATO states began individually discussing the situation with Putin. Hollande met with Russian President Putin on 26 November, primarily to discuss cooperation on countering ISIL, but he also called for de-escalation of the situation between Turkey and Russia. On the sidelines of the climate summit in Paris on 30 November, Obama and Merkel met with Putin to discuss the incident and other ongoing operations in Syria and Iraq. Cameron spoke with Putin on 9 December and agreed to provide U.K. assistance in analyzing the black box from the downed Su-24. NATO held an important three-day Foreign Ministers meeting beginning on 30 November and decided to augment Turkey’s maritime and air defenses. The U.S. agreed to keep the USS                                                                                                      Donald Cook—an anti-ballistic missile and air defense vessel—in the region. Germany and Denmark each committed to deploying a naval ship to the eastern Mediterranean. Denmark’s vessel was intended to counter the Russian S-400 system and to protect Turkey from any electronic intelligence gathering. Italy agreed to provide additional air-defense missile systems, and Spain agreed to extend the presence of its Patriot missile systems, which were already in Turkey as part of an earlier agreement. The German and Danish vessels arrived in the eastern Mediterranean later in December. Italy deployed the air-defense system to Turkey on 5 June 2016. On 13 December, Russia fired a warning shot at a Turkish vessel in the Aegean Sea, in what was widely regarded as retaliation for the downing of the Russian jet. In response, Turkey stated that its patience was limited and that Russia was overreacting, and it criticized Russia's military intervention in Syria. In mid and late December, hundreds of thousands of Turkish websites were hacked, forcing the government to temporarily block all foreign internet traffic to Turkish websites. There was some speculation that Russian hackers were responsible, but that allegation remains unproven. Controversy continues about the exact Russian role in the cyber attacks. On 18 December, the black box from the downed Su-24 was determined to be too damaged to provide any insight into the event. In a meeting that same day, NATO decided to further bolster Turkey’s defense capabilities by agreeing to provide German-manned Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) to assist in monitoring Turkish airspace. Some NATO sources indicated the group intended these actions to not only secure Turkey, but also to restrain both Turkey and Russia. The U.S. and Germany withdrew their Patriot missile systems from the Turkish-Syria border on 22 December, per the agreement signed three years earlier. NATO deployed the promised AWACS system to Turkey and began monitoring Turkish airspace on 1 March 2016. Turkey alleged that a Russian (Su-34) plane violated Turkish airspace again on 29 January 2016, a claim supported by the U.S. and NATO. Turkey summoned the Russian ambassador and, along with NATO, publicly called for respect of borders. Russia denied that the incident occurred and alleged that there was no such thing as “NATO airspace.” Tensions rose again in February. In the first week of the month, Russia deployed its newest and most sophisticated aircraft, the SU-35 “Flanker E,” to its base in Syria. In mid-February, Turkey began shelling Kurdish positions on the Syrian side of the border and discussing a joint ground invasion in Syria with Saudi Arabia. This prompted Russia to request UNSC discussion of the shelling on 15 February and to submit a draft resolution to halt the shelling and Turkey’s plans to launch a ground invasion on 19 February. The UNSC met on 16 and 19 February, but no agreement was reached; France, the U.K., and the U.S. were among those rejecting the Russian draft resolution. Press reports also began to appear in mid-February in which some NATO member government officials—especially Luxembourg, Germany, and France—said that they were not interested in defending Turkey if it provoked a war with Russia. This occurred as ongoing U.S.-Russian negotiations aimed at establishing peace in the Syrian civil war began gaining steam. Turkey quickly indicated that it would not invade Syria without a U.S.-led coalition. The events of mid-                                                                                                       February provided Ankara with a clear indication of the limits of NATO’s willingness to support Turkey and constituted the termination of the crisis for the NATO members. Russian-Turkish tensions continued to simmer for the next four months. Then, on 27 June, Turkish President Erdogan sent a letter to Putin indicating his regret for the jet downing incident and informing him that the pilots of the F-16s involved in the shooting were being investigated. Two days later, Presidents Erdogan and Putin spoke on the phone for the first time since the incident. They expressed a determination to jointly fight terrorism and agreed to meet in person. After the talk, Russia lifted its sanctions targeting Turkey’s tourist industry, and both parties planned to normalize trade relations and stated that “this crisis chapter” was closed. This terminated the crisis for Turkey, and the international crisis as a whole. The UN had limited involvement in the crisis. In addition to the UNSC’s discussion of the situation, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement on 24 November calling for de- escalation and a thorough review of the incident. After the crisis terminated, Russia continued its military actions in Syria, including near the Turkish border, and its support for the Assad regime. Nevertheless, Russia and Turkey made further moves to restore their bilateral relationship. On 1 July, the two countries' foreign ministers met in Sochi and agreed to establish closer diplomatic contact and cease operations against all groups in Syria other than ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and al-Qaeda-aligned groups. Attempts to repair relations proceeded more rapidly after a July coup attempt against Erdogan. Some media sources indicated that Russia provided intelligence to Erdogan about the attempted coup. On 9 August, Erdogan and Putin met in person for the first time since the jet downing incident and stated that a consensus on normalizing ties had been established. The warming of relations between Russia and Turkey coincided with U.S. and European Union criticism of Erdogan’s crackdown on the Turkish opposition in the wake of the failed coup. NATO-Russia cooperation on destroying ISIL also continued after the crisis.
A sixth crisis related to North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons occurred from 6 January until early December 2016. For the third crisis in a row related to this issue, the set of crisis actors consisted of the United States, South Korea, Japan, and North Korea (see cases # 408, 441, 450, 459, and 469 for the five previous North Korean nuclear crises). Since its first nuclear test in 2006, North Korea has tested a nuclear-capable device two more times, once in 2009 and again in 2013. Throughout the advancement of its nuclear program, the US has generally met each new development with sanctions, both unilaterally and by pushing through resolutions within the UN Security Council (UNSC). During his term as president, Barack Obama was able to get some concessions from North Korea. In February 2012, the North Korean regime agreed to halt its nuclear and long-range missile tests. However, North Korea continued to develop and test satellite launches that replicated the launch of long-range missiles. The US continued to push international sanctions as punishment and called upon the few remaining North Korean allies, namely China, to help put enough pressure on the Kim regime to stop any further developments. Tensions also remained high on the Korean peninsula. In 2004, the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) was created as a means to foster cooperation between North Korea and South Korea. Textile, fabric, car-part, and semiconductor industries operate within the complex, among other businesses. Since its inception, the facility has been used as a diplomatic tool to express displeasure. During the fifth North Korean nuclear crisis in 2013, the KIC was shut down for four months, but it was eventually re-opened in August of that year as a result of a bilateral agreement between the two Koreas. Nevertheless, persistent missile and nuclear tests have prompted strong reactions from the South Korean government, which has usually met the tests with shows of force or by undertaking joint military exercises with the United States. PRE-CRISIS: On 12 December 2015, North Korea announced that they had developed hydrogen bombs. This claim was met with some skepticism around the world. On 6 January 2016, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted its fourth underground nuclear weapons test, triggering a crisis for the US, Japan, and South Korea. The UNSC called an emergency session the same day and strongly condemned the test as a threat to international peace and security. The following day, the three crisis actors issued statements condemning the weapons test as a violation of North Korea’s international agreements and pledged to work together to forge a united response to the test. Japan’s prime minister also called on the UN to impose sanctions against North Korea, joining the United States and South Korea’s calls for new sanctions. Both Russia and China condemned the tests but cautioned that further sanctions against North Korea could lead Pyongyang’s already fragile economy to collapse.  Pledging to work together with the US and Japan constituted the first part of South Korea’s major response to the crisis on 7 January. The second part occurred on 8 January, when it resumed broadcasting anti-regime propaganda and pop music on loudspeakers at the border with North Korea. On 10 January, the US flew a nuclear-capable B-52 long distance bomber over South Korea to the Osan Air Base in Seoul to carry out training missions with the US and South Korean militaries. The following day, Seoul said that it would restrict the access of its nationals to the KIC in North Korea out of concern for the safety of its citizens. On 7 February, North Korea launched another long-range ballistic missile. This drew strong condemnation from the international community and prompted US-ROK talks about possible deployment of a joint missile defense system. Three days later, Japan issued restrictions on movement of people to and from North Korea. On 2 March, the UNSC unanimously adopted Resolution 2270 condemning North Korea’s test and expanding the existing sanctions against North Korea. Participation in these sanctions constituted the major responses by the US and Japan to the crisis. (Japan was a rotating member of the UNSC in 2016.) The sanctions triggered a crisis for North Korea. Kim Jong Un reacted the next day, 3 March, by announcing that the military was on standby to deploy the country’s nuclear warheads. In addition to the UN sanctions, the Obama administration implemented its own, unilateral sanctions against Pyongyang on 16 March. The sanctions froze North Korean property in the US and banned US exports and investment in North Korea. On 15 April, North Korea test launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile. Although the test failed, the UN called it a violation of existing Security Council resolutions. From April through October, North Korea conducted a series of other weapons tests, all of which were perceived as escalatory and threatening maneuvers by the other crisis actors. The US, Japan, and South Korea performed joint anti-ballistic missile tests on 27 June as a part of the US’s Rim of the Pacific exercises (RIMPAC) off of the Hawaiian coast. On 8 July, the US and South Korea announced plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), which could intercept short and medium-range missiles. China strongly opposed the missile system that it said could be used to spy on its military activities and could increase tensions between itself and North Korea. In August, the US and South Korea held joint military exercises south of the demilitarized zone despite North Korean threats that it would escalate the conflict. South Korea’s crisis ended on 29 October, when mass protests erupted over a corruption scandal enveloping President Park Geun-hye. The incident drew public attention in South Korea away from the nuclear issue. Nevertheless, South Korea remained involved in the crisis after this date, despite no longer perceiving a crisis itself. This included signing a military intelligence sharing agreement with Japan on 22 November, in order to help defend against North Korean threats. The UNSC issued another round of sanctions against North Korea on 30 November. The sanctions spurred a fading of the crisis for North Korea, because Pyongyang perceived them as a sign that the US and UN would not further escalate the crisis. The other contributing factor to the termination of the crisis was the quickly approaching change in US administration, indicating that the outgoing Obama administration would be unlikely to further escalate its military activities towards Pyongyang.  North Korea’s response to the new round of sanctions was tepid, suggesting it would not further escalate the conflict. The crisis for the US and Japan faded in early December. China and Russia played minor roles in the crisis. China perceived a political threat over the US and South Korean decision to deploy THAAD, and Russia slowed the adoption of UN sanctions against North Korea to ensure that they could maintain its coal trade with Pyongyang. The UN contributed marginally to the crisis abatement. The European Union (EU) was the most involved regional organization. On 5 and 31 March, the European Council transposed UNSC resolution 2270 into EU law and on 27 May, the European Council adopted additional sanctions against North Korea. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s and the International Atomic Energy Agency’s involvement in the crisis was limited to statements condemning the weapons test.
A second crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno- Karabakh (also known as Nagornyy-Karabakh, see case #401) occurred in April 2016. The crisis is informally known as the Four-Day War or the April War. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but the population is 95% ethnically Armenian. The roots of the conflict stem back to the 1920s when Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin assigned the territory to Azerbaijan. Following the end of Soviet rule in 1991, a war of independence was fought between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR, also referred to as the Republic of Artsakh), backed militarily and economically by the Armenian government, and Azerbaijan. In 1994, a Russian-led mediation effort helped the two sides reach a ceasefire agreement. The NKR failed to achieve its goal of secession; however, it was able to gain de facto control over a significant portion of Azeri territory. In response to the conflict within Nagorno-Karabakh, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) established the Minsk Group in 1994. The Minsk group is co- chaired by ambassadors from France, Russia, and the United States. Its mandate, established officially in 1995, tasks the group to provide a framework for negotiation and conflict resolution, to obtain an official cessation of conflict, and to promote the peace process. However, the efficacy of the institution came into doubt as little progress had been made in resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. Since the signing of the 1994 ceasefire, Nagorno-Karabakh’s independence had not been recognized; it remained internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. The NKR continued to hold onto the Nagorno-Karabakh region and the territory it gained during the conflict, which accounts for around 14% of Azerbaijan’s territory. Armenia continued to provide military and economic support to Nagorno-Karabakh. Violations of the 1994 ceasefire agreement along the established Line of Control (LoC) between Azeri and Armenian forces occurred regularly – e.g., 25 soldiers were killed in 2010 along the LoC. There was also a significant uptick in the intensity of hostilities between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh in the years leading up to the crisis. In addition to increased tensions between the two sides, Azerbaijan experienced an economic downturn starting in 2014, leading to mass protests in early 2016. The April War began along the Nagorno-Karabakh LoC between Azerbaijan on one side and Armenia and the Armenian-backed Artsakh Defense Army (ADA)– the armed forces of the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh – on the other. According to Armenia, late on the night of 1 April 2016 and in the early morning of 2 April, Azerbaijani forces launched a missile artillery attack in the Martuni region on the border between Nagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan. This triggered a crisis for Armenia. Armenia  launched its major response early on 2 April by firing across the border with mortars and high caliber grenade launchers, wounding several civilians. This triggered a crisis for Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan’s major response began that same day and consisted of further engagement with Armenian forces. Azerbaijan claimed that the ADA and Armenian Armed Forces initiated the hostilities. Most sources, however, indicate that Azerbaijan took the initiative. Fighting intensified between the two sides on 2 April in and around the towns of Aghdara, Tartar, Agdam, Khojavend, and Fuzuli. The combatants from both sides used heavy weapons in the clashes. Dozens of soldiers from both armies were killed, as were several civilians. According to Russian media, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense reported on 2 April that 12 of its soldiers had been killed. It also claimed to destroy 6 tanks, 15 artillery installations and engineering fortifications of the Armenian Armed Forces, and to kill and wound more than 100 Armenian servicemen. In the evening of 2 April, the presidents of both Armenia and Azerbaijan convened meetings of their respective national security councils. Russia, which sold weapons to both sides, called for all actors to exercise restraint and for an immediate ceasefire following the outbreak of hostilities. Russia also began a mediation effort between the two sides on 2 April, stepping outside of its role in the OSCE Minsk Group. Russia took the lead in mediating between the crisis actors. Russian ministers and officials remained in constant contact with their counterparts in both Armenia and Azerbaijan throughout the conflict. Russia also brought together Azerbaijan and Armenia's army chiefs in Moscow, for negotiations. Representatives from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic were not included in negotiations. The clashes continued for four days until 5 April, when both sides agreed to a Russian brokered ceasefire, terminating the crisis for both sides. The Azerbaijan’s defense ministry said in a statement that all military actions stopped as of 12 PM local time (8 AM GMT) the evening on 5 April. At the same time, a resumption of peace talks was announced. Azerbaijan took some territory during the fighting and was satisfied with the outcome of the crisis. Armenia was dissatisfied with the loss of land, despite trying to publicly frame the loss as insignificant. The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by France, the United States, and Russia, played a role as a secondary mediator of the crisis. Russia’s role in the OSCE effort was separate from its individual mediation effort during the crisis. The OSCE group met on April 5 and stressed the importance of restoring diplomacy and a sustainable ceasefire. The Minsk Group held a meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev in Baku where it urged all actors to resolve the conflict. Germany, which held the rotating presidency of the OSCE, met with Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan in Berlin the same day to reinforce negotiations and deescalate tensions. The OSCE Minsk Group continued its mediation effort after the crisis ended, bringing the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan together on 16 May. The U.S. State Department reported that the total casualty count over the five-day period was approximately 350 soldiers and civilians on both sides. Azerbaijan officials claimed that it regained 2,000 hectares of land. Armenia admitted to losing 800 hectares of land, but it argued  that the territory it lost was not of any tactical or strategic importance and hence that the status quo was maintained. U.S. and United Nations involvement was limited to condemning the violence and calling for negotiation to end the fighting.

The Senkakus (Diayous in Chinese) comprise a small chain of five core islands, among other features, located in the East China Sea. They are uninhabited, of questionable economic or strategic value, and are simultaneously claimed by China, Taiwan, and Japan. The United States transferred control of the islands to Japan in 1972, which has administered them since. Japan does not recognize foreign claims to the islands, nor has the United States taken a clear stance on the islands’ sovereignty. However, the United States has committed to defending Japan should it come under attack in the process of exercising administrative control. Although the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands have been disputed for decades, their significance in Sino-Japanese relations has sharply increased since 2010. On 7 September 2010, a Chinese fishing boat collided with a Japanese Coast Guard vessel in the waters surrounding the islands. Japan detained the boat and crew, and arrested its captain, which produced a major diplomatic row. In 2012, over Chinese objections, the Japanese government purchased the islands outright from a private owner. These two incidents drastically increased the prominence of the dispute, leading to increased Chinese efforts to undermine the Japanese claim. Since 2012, official Chinese Coast Guard ships have regularly conducted incursions into the territorial waters surrounding the islands, and official Chinese aircraft have regularly flown into their associated airspace. The United States, for its part, expanded its rhetorical support for the Japanese position, and has increased diplomatic and security coordination with Japan as part of the official U.S. policy to “deter conflict and coercion.” A Chinese military incursion in the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands during the very early hours of the morning of 9 June 2016 triggered a crisis for Japan. At 12:50am a PLA military frigate entered the contiguous waters adjacent to the Senkaku islands’ territorial waters. The contiguous zone stretches 12 nautical miles beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters, which hug the islands themselves. For roughly two hours before the Chinese ship had entered the zone, a Japanese military destroyer attempted to contact the vessel and advised it to change direction. The Chinese ship, however, maintained its course straight towards the islands’ territorial waters. Adding to the tumult, three Russian war ships passed through the contiguous zones from 10pm on 8 June to 3am on 9 June (though their entry was not protested by the Japanese), sparking concern of potential Chinese and Russian coordination. While this was not the first time that a Russian military ship had entered the contiguous zone, it marked the first time that a Chinese military vessel broached the region. In Tokyo, a crisis management team assembled inside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s office to monitor the situation. Abe was notified of the ship’s presence at around 1am on 9 June. At around the same time, the Chinese ambassador was called in to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, where the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Saiki Akitaka, demanded that Beijing remove the ship from the contiguous zone. The Chinese ambassador did not officially accede to the demand, but relayed that escalation was unwanted and that he would report back to his superiors. Vice Minister Akitaka felt that there was legitimate concern among Japanese officials at the time that the incursion would lead to a serious military clash between Chinese and  Japanese forces. Ultimately, this did not occur, as the Chinese ship left the contiguous zone at 3:10 am, and headed north. While the departure of the Chinese frigate lessened immediate tensions, it did not terminate the crisis altogether. On 9 June Abe ordered the Japanese Navy and Coast Guard to be on alert. Yoshide Suga, the chief cabinet official, noted at a press briefing that “China’s actions unilaterally escalate tensions in the area, and we are seriously concerned.” China, for its part, did not confirm that a military vessel had sailed around the islands, and publicly reaffirmed its belief that the Senkaku islands are Chinese territory. A Chinese Ministry of National Defense statement read: “For China’s military vessels to pass through waters under the country’s own jurisdiction is reasonable and legitimate, and other countries have no right to make irresponsible comments.” The United States acknowledged the incident but did not express judgment. On 9 June a U.S. State Department official said in a press briefing that the United States had been in touch with the Japanese government, and that they were monitoring the situation closely, but referred reporters to the Japanese for further detail about the incident. The crisis terminated shortly after it began, on 14 June 2016, as a joint military exercise between Japan, the United States, and India allayed Japanese concerns that China might attempt a land grab. Japan’s crisis ended around the start of a previously planned annual military exercise between Japan, India, and the United States dubbed Exercise Malabar. The exercise consisted of two portions: a harbor phase followed by an at-sea phase. The harbor portion began on 9 June in Sasebo, a port city in Southwestern Japan along the East China Sea, and the at-sea-phase began on 14 June in the Philippine Sea. As the exercises began, Japan was awaiting any significant response from China regarding their protests towards the Chinese incursions near the Senkaku Islands. The initiation of the at-sea-phase served to assure Japan of the strength of U.S. commitments to defend Japanese interests, and the lack of any significant Chinese response in the interim reassured Japan that the crisis would not escalate further.
The Durand Line, modified by the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919, demarcates Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in northern and western Pakistan from the northeastern, southern and eastern provinces of Afghanistan. Afghan discontent over the legitimacy of the Durand Line led to a series of irredentist claims to Pakistani territory, and support of separatist movements in support of these claims. Pakistan maintains the legitimacy of the Durand Line and has routinely enforced this border.           Pakistan and Afghanistan depend on broader stability of the region for their own stability. A violent and unstable Afghanistan interferes with Islamabad’s ability to address internal issues. Pakistani attempts to enforce the border with Afghanistan have included prior attempts to build gates and walls, and the installation of biometric equipment to track the flow of Afghan nationals in the region. The announcement in 2016 that Pakistan would construct a gate at the Torkham border crossing, which is the busiest border crossing along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, attracted the ire of Afghan officials and Afghan nationals in the region who depended on the border crossing for their survival. The gate’s construction was perceived to add legitimacy to the location of the border between the two nations, which Afghanistan has explicitly rejected. PRE-CRISIS In the period leading up to 12 June 2016, there were protests by Afghans on both side of the border, as well as action by the Afghan government. It is reported that retaliatory measures were engaged by Pakistan, including attacks on Afghan nationals and the razing of Afghan houses along the Torkham border region. On 11 May 2016, Pakistan closed the border but reopened it on 13 May after meeting with Afghan officials. Though tensions eased momentarily, they were reignited after a US drone strike killed a Taliban leader, Mullah Mansour, in Pakistan on 21 May 2016. This incident caused Pakistani officials to question the ease with which people can cross the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Violence broke out at 9:20 p.m. on 12 June 2016, in the city of Torkham, located along the contested Pakistani-Afghan border. This triggered a crisis for both Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is not known who made the first move—both Afghanistan and Pakistan later blamed each other for initiating. Some reporting suggests that Afghan border police had attempted to halt further Pakistani construction of the gate along the border. The head Pakistani civilian official in the area later claimed that an Afghan commander verbally protested construction of the gate, then returned to his base and turned off the lights. Then, according to the Pakistani official, the Afghans began firing towards the Pakistani side. The Afghans, for their part, claimed that the Pakistanis started firing at the Afghan side first, and had no choice but to respond in kind.           Fighting continued through the night and the following day. The firefight forced the closure of the Torkham checkpoint. Casualties began to mount: by Monday, at least two soldiers were killed, and at least eleven people (including civilians) were injured.           Diplomatic efforts began immediately. Both sides made statements denouncing the violence, emphasized that they responded to aggression initiated by the other, and stressed that the situation remained tense. Both nations rushed reinforcements, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, to the border. Behind closed doors, Afghan and Pakistani officials worked to find a diplomatic solution.           The United States contacted the leadership of both Afghanistan and Pakistan regarding the ongoing violence at Torkham. Although little is known about what was said between the three nations, the U.S. State Department publicly stated its concern with the ongoing violence, noted that it had  reached out to Afghanistan and Pakistan (which are both U.S. allies), and encouraged the nations to reach a peaceful agreement.           By the time a ceasefire deal was reached on 15 June, four soldiers had been killed, and at least 40 other people had been injured. While the ceasefire ended the immediate crisis for both actors, it did little to resolve the deeper roots of longstanding border disagreements. Afghanistan and Pakistan did show some signs of reducing the potential for further violence, as a little over a week later they agreed to establish a new coordination mechanism in order to prevent further border skirmishes. Later in July 2016, Pakistan completed construction of the Torkham gate.
Syria and Turkey engaged in an international crisis from August 2016 to March 2017, as part of the broader violence in northwest Syria at the time. The Syrian Civil War – which erupted in the wake of the Arab Spring of 2011 when the Authoritarian Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad refused to relinquish power and responded to massive protests with violence – is among the bloodiest conflicts to date in the 21st century. An April 2016 UN envoy’s estimate put the total death count at roughly 400,000; civilians likely constitute over one quarter of that number. The conflict has involved a wide range of state and non-state actors, including the United States, Russia, Iran, ISIL, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and the Free Syrian Army, among others. Many states and international organizations condemned the Assad regime’s actions, even as others, such as Russia, would ultimately use military force to help consolidate the Syrian government’s hold on power. In the immediate aftermath of Assad’s crackdown, Turkey verbally criticized the regime, ended all arms shipments to Syria, and provided safe haven for Syrian refugees and military defectors. By mid- 2012, Turkey had imposed sanctions on Syria and suspended all financial dealings, with the aim of blocking the delivery of all weapons and military equipment. Turkey also had begun training and equipping Syrian military defectors and select Syrian rebel forces, and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan had publicly demanded that Assad step down. In May 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama hosted a joint press conference with Erdogan, and stated that the two agreed that “Assad needs to go.” The train-and-equip strategy, which the United States also supported, ultimately fell flat even after international pressure increased following evidence of Syrian use of chemical weapons against anti- Assad supporters (see Crisis #470). Assad’s regime did not feel sufficient coercive pressure to relinquish authority, or even to seek a negotiated settlement; this was especially so once Russia intervened with military force on its behalf in September 2015. During 2014 and 2015, however, ISIL managed to take over and control significant swathes of territory in Syria, filling the void left by the degraded Syrian government security forces. Other rebel groups within Syria made gains, as well. The Free Syrian Army, elements of which were comprised primarily of defectors from the Syrian army, held pockets in the Northwest and Southwest parts of the nation; the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces controlled a large region in the Northeast. The relative success of the Kurdish groups caused concern in Ankara. Since 1978, the Turkish government has experienced armed conflict with various ethnically Kurdish separatist groups that have pushed to secede, and establish an independent Kurdistan. Turkey perceived the Syrian Democratic Forces to have links to its domestic insurgents, and to be a threat, despite the group’s relationship with the United States. As early as June 2015, rumors swirled that Erdogan would order a military intervention in Syria; that month, Erdogan stated that he would “never allow the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Syria.” Through 2015 and 2016, Turkish leaders began to soften their rhetoric on Assad, seeming to walk back from the clear-cut ‘no-Assad’ position they had taken during the conflict’s earlier years, indicating instead that they would accept a role for Assad in a political transition. The nation also experienced an increase in terror attacks in the years preceding the crisis. In late 2015, and into 2016, Turkey and some of its NATO allies experienced a crisis after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet in the region (see Crisis #476). And in July 2016, a faction within the Turkish military attempted a coup in the name  of restoring democracy to the. Reportedly, the coup nearly succeeded. Into that summer, the Syrian Democratic Forces continued to make gains in the northern Syria, and deepened their cooperation with the United States, generating further anxiety among Turkish political leaders. At 4 a.m. on 24 August 2016, under order from Erdogan, Turkish military tanks, fighter planes, and special operations forces, supported by U.S. airstrikes and other military support, crossed the border into Northern Syria in an operation dubbed Euphrates Shield. The incursion triggered a crisis for Syria. The move — which was Turkey’s first direct military involvement in the conflict — drew criticism from Russia, but nothing more, underscoring the rapprochement that had been reached between the two nations. Immediately, the Syrian regime harshly criticized the use of force, though from a military standpoint there was little that the nation, whose security forces were already overextended, could do to retaliate. Turkish forces, in coordination with elements of the Free Syrian Army armed group (often referred to as the “Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army” in this region), quickly captured the border city of Jarabulus, which had been an important supply line for ISIL. Later on 24 August, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden stated publicly that the United States strongly supported Turkey’s actions, and the U.S. had communicated to the Syrian Democratic Forces that they would need to meet a Turkish demand to withdraw to the east of the Euphrates river, and that they would not receive U.S. support if they ventured west. This served to ease U.S.-Turkish tensions. The Turkish intervention continued apace into October 2016, successfully clearing the area in northern Syria. On 22 October Erdogan announced that Turkish forces would continue southwest to the city of al-Bab, a city perceived to be a potential flashpoint for Turkish, Russian, and Syrian regime forces due to its strategic importance. Syrian Democratic Forces, too, were present in the area. For these reasons, U.S. forces did not follow, nor did they support, Turkish operations in al-Bab. The fighting for al-Bab began in early November, and proceeded smoothly for several weeks. On 2 November, however, Turkish forces perceived that they may have been bombed by a Syrian government warplane, and notified Erdogan and other high-ranking political leaders. This put Turkey into crisis. Erdogan and other top Turkish officials responded by scrambling Turkish planes in the region, and reportedly speaking on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin the following day. These actions successfully eased tensions, though it did not end Turkey’s crisis — the risk of some conflict with the Syrian government remained as long as Ankara continued its move on al-Bab. The extent to which Turkish-Russian relations could be managed peacefully as their forces engaged in operations near each other was put to the test on 9 February 2017 when a Russian plane accidentally struck Turkish troops in the al-Bab area. Yet another phone call between Erdogan and Putin, in which the Russian leader acknowledged and apologized for the incident, settled the matter. By the end of February 2017, Turkish forces had gained full control of the city, yet Syrian regime forces to the South had advanced to within 1.5 kilometers of the city. Fighting between Turkish allied forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces continued in neighboring towns. On 9 March Erdogan traveled to Moscow for a two-day summit. Once he returned to Ankara, nearly all clashes within Turkish controlled Syria had ceased. Turkey had achieved its narrowly defined goals of clearing ISIL in particular locations, and weakening the Kurdish forces in Syria. With several  thousand kilometers of Syrian territory under its de facto control, the Turkish government declared on 29 March 2017 that Operation Euphrates Shield had succeeded, and concluded. The Turkish forces began to transition to a stabilization effort that would provide services and security so that Syrian refugees in Turkey might be resettled. This terminated the crisis for both Syria and Turkey. While the Syrian regime was dissatisfied after the conclusion of Turkey’s intervention, it was also fairly well assured that Turkey would not continue to plunge deeper into its territory in pursuit of regime change. Turkey, for its part, was satisfied with the outcome as it achieved some of its primary goals of degrading Kurdish influence along the Turkey-Syria border, and toppling ISIL strongholds in the region. In terms of the role of international organizations, NATO applauded Turkey’s efforts against ISIL in Syria but the organization determined that it would not send forces or provide other military aid. The decision frustrated Turkish leadership. The UN, meanwhile, worked to resolve the intensifying humanitarian crisis in the Syrian city of Aleppo. The Assad regime had moved to cut off all supply lines to the city, perceived to be a strategically important rebel stronghold, depriving all civilians living in the city of food and water in the process. Over the fall of 2016, Russia vetoed two UN resolutions that called for an end to military fighting over Aleppo. UNSC Resolution 2336, which called for immediate humanitarian aid to, and evacuations from, the city, finally passed in December 2016. While UNSCR 2336 most directly regards the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, the process of the resolution’s adoption indirectly eased tensions among the crisis actors. This rare resolution pertaining to the civil war in Syria originated from close cooperation between Turkey and Russia. The limited public collaboration helped assure both Syria and Turkey that the potential for major escalation in the fighting against one another (and, in Turkey’s case, against Russia) was low.
In the 20 years prior to the crisis, militant activity in Indian-controlled Kashmir had continued to grow. Many terrorist organizations conducted attacks throughout the border region, primarily on Indian locations. JeM is one of these militant organizations, and India had blamed it for attacks linked to crises with Pakistan in both 2001 and 2002 (see Cases #435 and #436). JeM’s primary objective is irredentist: the removal of India from the Indian-administered Kashmir region and placing it under Pakistani control. JeM has ties to both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. India accused Pakistan of providing military assistance to the militants, which Pakistan consistently denied. Nevertheless, evidence indicates that Pakistan regularly supported separatist organizations operating within the Kashmir region. JeM and other organizations had been used by Pakistan’s Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) as proxies in order to achieve its goals within Kashmir. Pakistan provided JeM with training, arms, and funding, as well as a base from which to launch attacks into India. Pakistan insisted that it only provided moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people. While both countries engaged in peace talks, frequent attacks on Indian civilian populations repeatedly stalled peace efforts between the countries. Attacks in the years leading up to the crisis also escalated tensions along the Line of Control (LoC) which separates the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Jammu and Kashmir, leading to an increasing number of skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani military forces. The death toll from LoC skirmishes rose in the years leading up to the 2016 crisis. Recurrent denouncements of these skirmishes from both actors further hindered productive peace talks. Clashes between Pakistan and India along the LoC resulted in a crisis in 2014. Intense fighting occurred on 6 October 2014, during the first night of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha. The crisis faded shortly afterwards, though violence continued within the area. PRE-CRISIS: On 2 January 2016, several JeM members assaulted an Indian air force base in Pathankot, Punjab, killing several Indian military personnel. On 8 July 2016, Indian forces killed a top separatist militant, Burhan Wani, in Kashmir. Wani had gained prominence through his use of social media. Mass protests broke out on 9 July in response to Wani’s killing, and the protests were met with force by Indian police forces. Reports indicated that ten civilians were killed, and 30 civilians and 96 security officers injured on 9 July. Indian police imposed a curfew, which was violated by protestors. The protests received a great deal of media coverage and continued for months. Leading up to the crisis, at least 78 civilians and two police officers were killed and thousands injured in the protests. According to multiple sources, the unrest in Kashmir was the worst in six years. The events also created a tense atmosphere in the region in the lead- up to the crisis. In the early-morning hours of 18 September 2016, four Kashmiri militants attacked an Indian army base in Uri, a town within the Indian administered Jammu-Kashmir region, triggering a crisis for India. Using grenades and assault weapons, the militants killed 18 Indian soldiers during the raid which reportedly lasted for three hours. Initially, no group came forward to claim responsibility for the attack. Following an investigation of the incident, Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh from the Indian Army claimed on the same day (18 September) that the Pakistani-based militant organization Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) was behind the attack, adding that the equipment they carried had Pakistani markings. Lt. Gen. Singh indicated the military’s readiness to respond to the incident and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack and promised to punish those who were responsible for the attack. These verbal accusations and threats from India triggered a crisis for Pakistan. The following day, Pakistan conducted its major response to the crisis, a two-pronged verbal reaction. Pakistan first denied any involvement in the attacks, accusing India of attempting to divert attention away from the deteriorating situation within Indian-administered Kashmir by blaming Pakistan through unsubstantiated accusations. Pakistan also stated that it (Pakistan) would bring the Kashmir issue to the United Nations and to the international community. Toward that end, Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif wrote a letter to the UN Security Council. The letter stressed the need for the permanent-five members of the UNSC (P5) countries to address the human rights violations that Pakistan stated were occurring within Kashmir and bring about a resolution to the dispute in general. The intent of the letter was to get the P5 to put pressure on India. Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced increasing pressure to retaliate militarily against Pakistan, though many analysts warned India against using the military option. On 19 September, Modi chaired a high-level meeting to discuss responses to the attack. Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the head of the army chief, and heads of several Indian intelligence agencies were present at this meeting. At this meeting, the Indian government decided to pursue a policy of diplomatically isolating Pakistan from international forums and to refrain from military retaliation. These decisions constituted India’s major response to the crisis. India also sent additional forces to the region to patrol and perform operations to secure the region. Each side took further steps to pressure one another during the crisis. In response to the veiled Indian threats to use force against those it found responsible for the attack, the Pakistani Army chief, General Raheel Sharif, stated that his forces were prepared to respond to any direct or indirect military threat. India on the other hand went to the various members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to gather support for its cause, in an attempt to accomplish its political objective of isolating Pakistan. India was successful in obtaining statements from various countries such as Saudi Araba, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain, which supported India in its fight against terrorism and condemned the attack. However, the OIC as a whole sided with Pakistan, calling for an end to Indian atrocities occurring within Kashmir and not commenting on the Uri base attack. On 20 September, the Indian Federal Law Minister announced the decision made a day prior, that India would not pursue a military option against Pakistan. India stated that it would pursue an approach of strategic restraint against its adversary instead. This announcement terminated the crisis for both countries. The United States and Russia condemned the Uri base attack and supported India’s counter-terrorism operation, but neither country criticized Pakistan directly. UN involvement was limited to condemnation of the Uri base attack from Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.  In a speech on 25 September, Modi claimed that India achieved its objective of diplomatically isolating Pakistan. Contradicting India’s claim of success, Sartaj Aziz, the advisor to the Pakistani Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, announced the failure of India’s attempt to isolate Pakistan the following day. According to Aziz, 56 countries from the OIC, the UN Human Rights Council, and other organizations supported Pakistan and rejected what it referred to as India’s baseless accusations. Once again, Pakistan accused India of attempting to mislead the international community and draw attention away from the Kashmir crisis.
Rwanda and Uganda were involved in an intra-war crisis from August 1999 until November 2001, as these former allies in the DRC Civil War turned against one another. On 2 August 1998, both Rwanda and Uganda invaded the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in support of the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD), in order to depose Congo’s President Laurent Kabila. For information on the broader crisis, the DRC Civil War, see Crisis #426. The two nations were formally allied and proclaimed that they had invaded the DRC for purposes of self-defense. Yet this facade, and the Ugandan-Rwandan alliance, shattered in 1999 as tensions between the two nations boiled over into three rounds of violent conflict on the streets of the diamond-rich city of Kisangani. The Ugandan-Rwandan tensions stem from the fractionalization of the RCD – specifically a larger group known as RCD-Goma – which began to splinter in 1998 and led to the eventual formation of RCD- Kisangani. The initial leader of the RCD, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, wished to negotiate with the Kabila government, yet the next level of leadership did not. In spring 1999, Wamba was thrown out of the RCD headquarters, and fled to Kisangani on a Ugandan cargo plane with aims to begin a new rebel group with broad grassroots support. The Ugandan government supported this effort. Prior to the onset of the crisis, Rwanda served as the primary backer of the RCD in the Kisangani region. When he arrived in May 1999, Wamba found the city of Kisangani divided up into a Ugandan and Rwandan zone, each with Congolese rebel allies. The Ugandan commander in the region refused to consult with the Rwandans even though he was supposed to maintain a joint command with his younger, less experienced Rwandan counterpart. Tensions further rose in the summer of 1999 after Ugandan troops arrested Rwandan pilots for failure to notify the Ugandan command of their intended arrival. Meanwhile, in July 1999, the UN negotiated a ceasefire agreement between the governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, among others, dubbed the Lusaka agreements. The agreements, however, did not ease tensions in Kisangani. Wamba subsequently began hosting rallies around the city, denouncing the Rwandans. Rwandan leaders responded with similarly incendiary rhetoric. By the beginning of August 1999, the situation had reached a fever pitch. Crisis An intra-war crisis was triggered simultaneously for Rwanda and Uganda on 7 August 1999, as the two sides clashed in Kisangani. It is unclear which side opened fire first. The fighting lasted for a little over one week, during which time over 50 soldiers died between the parties. Reports also indicated numerous civilian casualties and potential abuses. In addition to the Rwandan national forces, the RCD joined Rwanda in their clashes against Uganda in Kisangani. Many of the accusations surrounding abuses in the Kisangani area were levied against this group. Following a meeting between Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park, the two sides agreed upon a ceasefire on 17 August. A formal agreement was signed on 31 August. This did not end the crisis, however, as tensions remained high and the two sides relapsed into violent clashes twice more before crisis termination. Both  sides’ major responses to the crisis and overall crisis management techniques involved a combination of the use of violence and the participation in diplomatic talks. On 5 May 2000, Ugandan and Rwandan forces once again briefly clashed before coming to another ceasefire agreement after meeting in Tanzania for the first instance of attempted mediation in the crisis. The agreement did not last long. On 5 June 2000, Rwandan and Ugandan military units fought once again, leading to over 150 civilian deaths and 700 civilian injuries. Yet again, the two sides met to come to an agreement in order to resolve the ongoing crisis. The crisis came to an end on 6 November 2001 after a second round of mediation, this time held in the United Kingdom, which was an aid donor to both countries. Presidents Museveni from Uganda and Kagame from Rwanda (Kagame became president in 2000) spoke for nearly six hours and later announced that both sides agreed to cease sheltering the rebels each side had been supporting. The British-led mediation served as a crucial factor in ending the multi-year long crisis. Due to the ongoing civil war in the DRC, the United Nations took particular interest in the conflict in Kisangani. The UN Security Council quickly called for an end to the fighting between Uganda and Rwanda, and sought the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces to the city. Initially, the rebel forces, particularly the RCD, fought to keep UN forces out of the city; however, they eventually relented. Supporting the UN’s effort in the DRC was the Organization of African Unity (OAU)., which provided forces and observation groups to the UN. The United States had very little involvement in the crisis, offering political words of encouragement towards finding a peaceful end to the tensions in Kisangani. Additionally, the US State Department issued a statement criticizing the violence and warned that further conflict could lead to frayed relations with the US.
Kosovo and Serbia experienced a crisis related to Kosovo’s contested sovereignty in early 2017. On 16 February 2008, the province of Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia following nearly ten years of NATO and United Nations control of the former-Yugoslavian territory. Following the declaration, Serbia vowed unyielding but peaceful resistance to the secession. By 2017, 114 countries recognized Kosovo’s independence. NATO maintained a constant peacekeeping force in Kosovo – Kosovo Force (KFOR) – starting in June 1999. The NATO presence followed a two-year war between Serbia and Kosovo (Crisis 430), wherein nearly 10,000 individuals were killed. A 78-day, NATO-led air bombing campaign brought an end to the conflict. KFOR was gradually reduced in size from and initial 50,000 troops in 1999 to 5,000 troops by 2011. NATO became supportive of Kosovo’s bid to join the European Union (EU), into which Serbia also sought membership. The EU supported and assisted Kosovo with missions and in-country representation since 2008. Serbia applied for membership in 2009 and subsequently tried to reach the EU-mandated benchmarks necessary for full membership. In late-2016 and early 2017, tensions between Serbia and Kosovo increased due to two separate incidents. In December 2016, local Serbian authorities in Kosovo began building a wall in the town of Mitrovica, dividing the town between ethnic Serbians and Albanians. The construction was met with criticism and was halted. On 4 January 2017, a former Kosovan prime minister and guerilla commander, Ramush Haradinaj, was arrested in France. French police arrested him due to a Serbian warrant. The warrant for Haradinaj’s arrest was issued based on Serbian claims that he committed war crimes during the 1998-99 war between the two territories. Kosovo maintained that Haradinaj had already been tried by the UN for war crimes and was acquitted. On 14 January 2017, Serbia dispatched a train to Kosovo that was painted in Serbian national colors and decorated in Serbian nationalist images and slogans such as “KOSOVO IS SERBIA,” triggering a crisis for Kosovo. Decisionmakers in Kosovo perceived the train—the first to travel from Belgrade to northern Kosovo since the 1998-99 Kosovo war—as a threat to Kosovo’s sovereignty. They pledged publicly to prevent it from traveling into Kosovo’s territory. Edita Tahiri, the Kosovan government minister who held communication responsibilities with Serbia, condemned the act as a “provocation” that “endangers the sovereignty and territorial integrity and national security” of Kosovo. She called on the international community to halt the “illegal Serbian train.” Kosovo’s Prime Minister, Isa Mustafa, reached out to the United States and the EU in order to express concerns about the train. Meanwhile, Kosovo’s special police forces massed at the border in preparation to stop the train if necessary—this action on 14 January amounted to Kosovo’s major response. Kosovo’s police movement prompted a crisis for Serbia, whose leaders gathered in a specially convened National Security Council session.  Serbia’s Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, ordered that the train be stopped as it approached Kosovo’s border, falsely stating that ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had attempted to place bombs along the railway. He said of the incident, and the decision: “This was an ambition to provoke a conflict, to start a wider conflict in this territory that we consider as ours…It was my decision to stop the train in Raska to preserve the freedom and lives of our people, to prevent a wider conflict and show that we want peace.” Serbia’s president, Tomislav Nikolic on 15 January accused Kosovan Albanians of attempting to provoke “war,” and noted that the two nations were “on the verge of clashes.” Serbia’s accusations constituted their major response to the crisis. The decision to stop the train before it reached the Kosovo border reduced immediate tensions, but did not end the crisis, as both sides continued to levy accusations in its aftermath. Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaci, declared that Serbia was planning to grab a portion of northern Kosovo using the “Crimea model,” referencing Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine. Nikolic pointed to Kosovo’s deployment of special police at the border as evidence of its desire for war. The U.S. Embassy in Pristina, for its part, issued a statement urging all sides to reduce dangerous rhetoric, adding that “Kosovo is a sovereign, independent country and we respect the right of Kosovo to manage who and what crosses its borders.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged the EU to help defuse tensions. Although NATO has thousands of troops stationed in Kosovo, NATO was not involved during the crisis. The EU, however, supplied mediation—which both nations utilized as their primary crisis management technique. Serbia’s Vucic and Nikolic met with Kosovo’s Thaci and Mustafa in Brussels on 24 January, in a negotiation session hosted by EU Foreign Policy chief, Federica Mogherini. A second and final round of talks, again in Brussels, occurred on 1 February, but ultimately failed to immediately ease tensions between the two states. In bombastic language, Vucic publicly blamed Kosovo for the collapse of talks. Mogherini, on the other hand, stated that she was “encouraged by the constructive engagement shown by both sides.” There were no further talks between Serbia and Kosovo regarding the train incident, and both sides toned down rhetoric thereafter. The crisis faded after the second round of negotiations in early February 2017.
A crisis between Pakistan and Afghanistan, related to longstanding issues of border security and border contestation, occurred from February to May in 2017. This crisis is the result of long-standing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which reached another flashpoint in February 2017. (For more on the history of the Afghan-Pakistani conflict, and in particular on the disputed border known as the Durand Line, see Crisis #480.) In July 2016, in the aftermath of the Torkham Border Incident in June 2016 (Crisis #480), Pakistan completed construction of a dividing gate in the border city of Torkham. The construction of the Torkham gate is one element of Pakistan’s overarching aim to draw a line between what they judge to be Pakistani and Afghan territory, for both symbolic and security reasons. Physical dividers imposed by Pakistan in the form of gates and fences serve to legitimize the geographic location of the border, which Pakistan tends to favor and Afghanistan rejects. Moreover, Pakistan argues that such obstacles will make it more difficult for terrorists and insurgents who officials claim enjoy sanctuary in Afghanistan to cross the border. Nonetheless, Afghanistan regularly protests Pakistani efforts to physically demarcate the border, sometimes with violence. Beginning in 2015 and into 2017, both Pakistan and Afghanistan experienced significant levels of violence conducted by a subsidiary group of the Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K). IS-K‘s early membership consisted of an amalgamation of militants from other groups—primarily the Pakistani Taliban—who declared allegiance to the larger Islamic State umbrella group in January 2015. The group, which is principally based in Afghanistan and has received financial and materiel support from IS since its inception, aims to establish a Caliphate in South and Central Asia governed under Sharia law. While overall levels of violence in the lead up to 2017 did not deviate significantly from standard levels (attacks by various militant groups occurred regularly), IS-K bombings of both civilian and state targets— some carried out by extremists with explosives strapped to their chests—became increasingly common. In February 2017, the situation in Pakistan became especially dire. Over four days, militants attacked all four Pakistani provinces and three major urban areas. Pakistan had not witnessed an equivalent spate of violence since 2014 and, as one analyst summarizes, the bloodshed “may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.” A crisis for Pakistan was triggered on 16 February 2017. A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a crowd gathered at the Lal Shahbaz shrine in Sehwan Sharif, Pakistan, killing over 70 people. ISIS-K took immediate responsibility for the attack. This attack started a prolonged crisis between Pakistan and Afghanistan, centering around control over the border between the two nations. Immediately following the shrine attack, a Pakistani military spokesperson blamed hostile powers, specifically Afghanistan, for directing and providing sanctuary for terrorists and allowing such events to occur. Afghanistan’s crisis was triggered the following day, 17 February, when Pakistani artillery shelled what Pakistan claimed to be terrorist facilities in Afghanistan. In addition to the shelling, Pakistan closed  their border with Afghanistan at Torkham and Chaman. The closing of the border and the shelling constituted Pakistan’s major response. Afghanistan’s major response to the shelling was to deny any allegations that it was harboring or directing terrorists against Pakistan. Afghanistan did not respond to the shelling or border crossing with violence, instead preferring diplomatic dialogue with Pakistani ambassadors and foreign affairs officials. Pakistan reopened the borders towards the beginning of March. On 27 March 2017, Pakistan announced that it had resumed building a border fence between the two nations, stating that they were focusing on “high threat zones.” The construction of the fence increased tensions between the two nations as Afghanistan reacted with threats of violence should Pakistan continue the project. The tensions culminated in a clash in the Chaman region, near the villages of Killi Luqman and Killi Jahangi, when Afghani police confronted a Pakistani security team escorting a census team. At least 11 people were killed. The crisis came to an end on 27 May 2017, after the two sides signed a ceasefire agreement and agreed to keep the border opened between the two countries. No provision was made regarding Pakistan’s construction of the border wall, which continued after the conclusion of the crisis. The United States played a limited role in the crisis, first by condemning the attack on the shrine and then by requesting that Pakistan work with Afghanistan on fighting terrorism. Pakistan ignored the American requests, and no further action was taken by the U.S. Afghanistan submitted complaints to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) during the crisis, first after Pakistan shelled Afghanistan, and then once Pakistan started building their border wall. There was no direct response from the UNSC on these matters. In April, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees resumed support for the repatriation of refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan, and the UN migration agency sent out a team to assess border management capabilities in order to produce a comprehensive report and guidance for border maintenance.
The U.S., Russia and Syria experienced a crisis in April 2017, triggered by Syria’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war. On August 21, 2013, a gas attack in the Syrian capital of Damascus killed over 1,400 civilians within the city (see Crisis 470). An intelligence report released by the United States alleged that the Syrian government, led by Bashar al-Assad, used rockets filled with sarin gas and other toxic chemicals against its own people. U.S. President Obama had issued a stern warning to the Syrian regime in 2012: any use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people would be crossing a red line necessitating probable military intervention. After facing stiff resistance both from within the U.S. and abroad, Obama tabled any potential military strikes against the state. Instead, the U.S. settled for an agreement with Russia to jointly dismantle the chemical weapons programs of the Syrian regime. The Syrian government, however, continued developing its chemical weapons program covertly, partly due to expectations of Russian cover in the event of future detection of Syrian violations. In January 2017, Donald Trump became President of the U.S. As a candidate, Trump had indicated hesitancy toward military intervention against the Syrian regime. Even as far back as 2013, Trump was a vocal supporter of non-interference in the Syrian civil war. On the morning of 4 April 2017, Syrian government forces carried out an airstrike in which they released toxic chemical gases on the town of Khan Shaykhun in northwestern Syria. The attack killed more than 80 people and injured hundreds more, triggering a crisis for the U.S. because of its interests in enforcing the 2013 agreement that committed Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. The Assad regime denied that it had used any chemical or toxic gases. Russia concurred, claiming that the attack had been fabricated by the West. A UN fact-finding mission later confirmed the use of chemical weapons. On the evening of 6 April, U.S. President Trump informed Congress of his plans for airstrikes. U.S. authorities warned several countries, including Russia, of the coming attack. On the morning of 7 April (6 April EST), the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Shayrat Airbase from two warships located in the eastern Mediterranean, triggering a crisis for Syria and Russia. The attack lasted three to four minutes. There were no Russian aircrafts on the base at the time of the attack due to the U.S. warning. Syrian officials reported that the attack killed seven people and injured nine. They strongly condemned the U.S. attack and accused the U.S of fabricating the chemical weapons attack to justify its airstrike. Russia echoed that the West had fabricated the attack and threatened to sever its deconfliction communication line – used to alert both militaries of operations in Syria - with the U.S. The Russian military also promised to help Syria strengthen its air defenses after the strike to help protect Syrian infrastructure. On 24 April, the UNSC voted on a resolution to sanction Syria, although Russia vetoed the resolution. The same day the U.S. announced its own sanctions against 271 Syrian researchers and employees for participating in the development of the weapons. The Russian veto and U.S. sanctions terminated the crisis for all actors. NATO and the EU also condemned the Syrian airstrike but did not take any action during the crisis period.
Starting in July 2017 and continuing into 2018, the U.S., South Korea and Japan faced North Korea in a crisis related to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The sixth international crisis related to North Korea’s nuclear-weapons program (Crisis #477) ended in the last months of 2016. The crisis actors briefly entered a period of uncertain peace. However, tensions began to rise again just weeks later in the lead up to the U.S. administration change. As president-elect, Donald Trump was predicted by many to be a brash leader with a more confrontational stance on North Korea than the previous Obama administration. For example, on 3 January 2017, Trump declared via Twitter that he would not tolerate North Korea’s development of missiles with the capacity to strike parts of the U.S. Despite Trump’s warnings, Pyongyang remained undeterred in maintaining and enhancing its nuclear program. On 20 January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Three weeks after Trump assumed the presidency, North Korea tested a new medium-range ballistic missile system on 12 February 2017. North Korean media called the test a success and indicated that the missile flew approximately 500 km at a lofted trajectory. On 6 March, North Korea launched four more ballistic missiles near the Chinese border. The missiles landed 1000 km away, at sea in the Japanese exclusive economic zone, 300 km off the coast of Japan. Pyongyang conducted additional missile tests on 5 and 16 April. On 6 April, Chinese and U.S. leaders met and agreed to apply greater pressure on North Korea to denuclearize. The Trump administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine General Joseph Dunford, briefed the U.S. Senate on 26 April on its new strategy towards increasing pressure on North Korea to denuclearize. North Korea denounced the American actions. Trump warned the following day that major military action against North Korea was not off the table. On 2 May, the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, deployed in Seongu, South Korea, became operational. The system was intended to detect and intercept North Korean missiles launched at South Korea. Moon Jae-in was elected president of South Korea days later, on 9 May, and he advocated for diplomatic talks with North Korea provided it halt its nuclear activity. North Korea conducted another missile test of Hwasong-12 missiles on 14 May. The intermediate-range ballistic missiles could reportedly travel up to 4,800 km. In reaction, the UNSC expanded sanctions on North Korea on 1 June, targeting four entities and fourteen officials. South Korean and U.S. leaders met at a summit in Washington on 29-30 June to discuss next steps in their approach to North Korea. On 3 July 2017, North Korea performed a test of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Based on the demonstrated capabilities of the missile, some analysts believed it could reach Alaska but was not capable of reaching Hawaii. This ICBM test launch triggered the crisis for the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The U.S.’s initial response comprised two main actions on 4 July. First, the U.S. and South Korean forces performed joint military exercises, which included test firings of their own ballistic missiles along the  coast of the Korean Peninsula. These joint exercises also constituted South Korea’s main response to the crisis trigger. Second, the UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting, acting on a request from the U.S. Japan responded on 4 July with harsh criticism of North Korea, stating that the test was in clear violation of the restrictions placed upon North Korea by the UNSC. It lodged a complaint against North Korea and called for action from the UNSC. Further escalation of the crisis occurred on 28 July. North Korea tested a second ICBM with the potential capabilities to reach the west coast of the U.S. according to some experts, though there was uncertainty regarding the missile’s exact capabilities. Once again, the U.S. and South Korea responded with joint military exercises and launching of their own ballistic missiles. This second test also prompted South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, to reverse his decision to halt deployment of the controversial THAAD missile defense system, telling the South Korean military to deploy the system. Due to the repeated tests of the ICBMs, the UNSC imposed new sanctions on North Korea on 5 August. These sanctions had the potential to effect a one-third reduction in North Korean export revenue and triggered a crisis for North Korea. North Korea responded on 7 August, stating that the country would seek to retaliate against the United States “thousands of times” over and promised to never give up its nuclear arsenal. Further escalation for North Korea came just one day after North Korea’s remarks. On 8 August, U.S. President Trump threatened “fire and fury like the world has never seen” should North Korea make any more threats against the U.S. North Korea responded by stating it was considering a strike against Guam, which houses an important US Air Force base. The main crisis management technique for each of the crisis actors remained non-violent military activity throughout the early part of the crisis. Each side participated in some form of joint military exercises, tests of missile capabilities, or test of missile defense systems. These crisis management techniques would change towards the end of 2017, shifting towards negotiation. Several additional, important events occurred during the later-half of 2017 which caused the crisis to continue into 2018. North Korea launched a missile directly over northern Japan on 28 August. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated that the launch was an “unprecedented, serious and grave threat,” which caused several train lines to be halted and set off alert systems throughout the country. Tensions continued to rise when North Korea conducted a test of a hydrogen bomb on 3 September. The test spurred further live-fire exercises by the United States and South Korea, wide-spread condemnations, and prompted additional sanctions by the UNSC on 12 September. On 2 January 2018, South Korea and North Korea decided to hold talks for the first time in two years. The two states also agreed to reestablish a hotline between them that it had disconnected after the closing of the Kaesong industrial complex. The talks were held on 9 January along the demilitarized zone in Panmunjom. Around the same time, the U.S. and South Korea agreed to postpone their annual joint military exercise until after the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Over Easter weekend, on 31 March 31 and 1 April, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held a secret meeting in North Korea to lay the groundwork for a summit between Kim and Trump in early June 2018 to discuss North Korea’s nuclear status. Trump announced that the meeting went smoothly and that the two adversaries established a good relationship. However, despite the more  conciliatory rhetoric from both sides following the meeting, uncertainty remained as to whether the meeting would take place. On 27 April Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met again in Panmunjom at an Inter- Korean Summit and signed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula, which called for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The summit terminated the crisis for South Korea and Japan. In mid-May 2018, tensions rose between the U.S. and North Korea once again, when Trump cancelled the U.S.-North Korea meeting over what he referred to as North Korean hostilities. He also signaled his willingness to use whatever means possible to end the North Korea nuclear threat. North Korea also stated they were ready to respond to any U.S. action. Despite Trump's statement, the two countries did meet on 12 June and signed a joint declaration calling for regional peace and eventual complete denuclearization on the peninsula. The signing of the joint declaration signaled the end of the crisis for North Korea and the U.S. Regarding UN activity, in addition to the sanctions imposed by the UNSC, the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, criticized North Korea, stating that the first ICBM test constituted a “dangerous escalation of the situation.” In the early part of the crisis, Russia and China both reacted to the events. Russia performed several shows of force, including flying a nuclear bomber near the Korean peninsula during U.S.-South Korean exercises on 24 August 2017. China’s main role during the crisis came in criticizing South Korea’s decision to deploy the THAAD system, which China had vehemently opposed since 2016. Additionally, China and Russia held joint anti-ballistic missile defense exercises starting in mid-December 2017. The main regional organization to respond to the crisis was the EU. In addition to condemning the crisis, the EU added their own sanctions on top of the UNSC sanctions of 5 August 2017. These sanctions consisted of travel bans and asset freezes in 2017 and 2018 against individuals involved in North Korea’s nuclear program. It also adopted the sanctions against the individuals and entities listed in the UNSC resolutions against North Korea. NATO and the IAEA played a minor role in the conflict. The 3 July 2017 missile test and 3 September nuclear test each received statements of condemnation from NATO and the IAEA respectively. While they both verbally condemned North Korea’s nuclear tests, they did not take any further action.
The Soviet Union experienced a mini-nuclear crisis with the United States from 2 to 11 November 1983. Throughout the East/West protracted conflict one of the most important tasks of the intelligence services of the two superpowers was to monitor military exercises and alert procedures of the adversary. The most crucial were war games involving the planned use of nuclear weapons in both "first-strike" and retaliation scenarios.  Like the Warsaw Pact, NATO had conducted war games before, but its 1983 nuclear exercise, Able Archer, was more extensive than ever before. The Soviet misperception of the U.S.'s and NATO's intentions was influenced by its image of the Reagan administration as unpredictable, with a president who was willing to use force to protect and enhance U.S. "national interests." In the 18 months before Exercise Able Archer the U.S. had dispatched forces to Lebanon (see Case #337--War in Lebanon, in 1982-83, in the Arab/Israel PC) and to Honduras to weaken the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. It also engaged in a show of force against Libya (see Case #330--Gulf of Syrte I, in 1981, in Africa: Non-PCs). And on 25 October 1983, a week before Able Archer began, the Reagan administration launched its Invasion of Grenada (see Case #343, in Americas: Non-PCs).  Soviet mistrust and concern were also reinforced by an incident on 1 September 1983, when a Soviet fighter plane shot down a Korean airliner, KAL-007, which penetrated deep into Soviet airspace while on a flight from Alaska to Seoul; all passengers and crew were killed, including 60 Americans. This incident caused deep concern in the U.S. Reagan later wrote in his memoirs: "If anything, the KAL incident demonstrated how close the world had come to the precipice and how much we needed nuclear arms control." Given this series of events, all of which were perceived in the Soviet prism as hostile and threatening, the sudden discovery of Exercise Able Archer was interpreted as ominous by Soviet decision makers. On 2 November 1983 NATO began a military exercise code-named Able Archer. The large-scale war game embraced all NATO territory from Norway to Turkey between 2 and 11 November and included large amounts of arms and combat equipment. Its aim was to test nuclear release mechanisms in case of a nuclear first strike against the Soviet bloc.  Able Archer was misperceived by the USSR as preparation for, not a simulation of, a nuclear attack by the West. It therefore triggered a grave crisis for the USSR--the closest the two superpowers came to a direct nuclear confrontation since the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962 (see Case #196). During the exercise, U.S. intelligence, monitoring Soviet communications, was alarmed to hear that the USSR was expecting--and preparing for--a nuclear war in a short time. The Soviet misperception was profoundly influenced by NATO's use of new communications procedures in Able Archer, which went through all alert stages, from normal to general alert.  The USSR first responded on 5 November, sending messages to the KGB residencies in Europe to warn of a Western surprise attack and ordering them to increase their vigilance. The same day a Politburo member, Romanov, in a public speech, described the international situation as "thoroughly white hot," a rarely used expression that indicated acute stress.  KGB agents in Germany reported on the 5th that U.S. bases had been placed on alert and that there were irregular troop movements. Moscow then sent urgent telegrams on the 8th-9th to its agents across Western Europe, warning of the U.S.'s nuclear alert. The Soviet major response came on the 9th, when it placed its nuclear fighters on higher alert.  The U.S. was astounded by the Soviet perception and by its profound concern about an imminent nuclear threat. Nonetheless, the very high tension generated by Exercise Able Archer, a mini-Cuban Missile crisis, ended without violence or incidents between the two superpowers: with the end of NATO's nuclear exercise on 11 November, the USSR's crisis terminated abruptly.  Although the incident was concealed by both sides, and little has been published since then, Able Archer seems to have had a profound effect on the East/West conflict. The day the crisis ended Reagan publicly called for the elimination of nuclear armaments in the world. The crisis also seems to have transformed Reagan's image of the "evil empire."  There was no UN involvement in this crisis.
The United States and Nicaragua were engaged in a brief crisis (6-12 November 1984) over the reported dispatch of advanced fighter planes by the USSR to the pro-Soviet regime in Managua. After years of struggle against the Somoza dictatorship the left-wing Sandinista movement achieved power in 1979. Tension and mistrust between the U.S. and the Sandinista government, evident in the last year of the Carter administration, became acute when Reagan entered the White House at the beginning of 1981. By then Nicaragua had become informally aligned with the Soviet Union. The Reagan administration made it clear that it regarded the marxist regime "in America's backyard" as a threat to U.S. national security; and that it perceived the bilateral conflict with Managua as part of the Cold War with the USSR. It was in this hostile global context and an intense U.S. domestic political setting--the presidential election was due on 6 November 1984--that the MIG-21 crisis erupted. Reports surfaced in Washington on election day that a Soviet cargo ship, the Bakuriani, was en route to Nicaragua carrying MIG-21s for the Sandinista regime. To some in the newly reelected Reagan administration with a disposition to historical analogies, this was perceived as a minireplay of another, grave, superpower crisis in the Americas 22 years earlier, when Soviet ships were reported carrying offensive missiles to a nuclear weapons base in Castro's Cuba (see Case #196--Cuban Missiles).  The U.S. response, on the 7th, was to increase the number and visibility of military exercises the Pentagon was conducting in Nicaragua's neighbor, Honduras, and in general to "flex its muscles" on land and at sea in and near Central America. This show of strength and the accompanying hard-line rhetoric in Washington were perceived in Managua as signals of an imminent U.S. invasion. The specific act that triggered a crisis for Nicaragua was the pursuit by two U.S. frigates of a merchant vessel flying the Soviet flag--when the ship was already in Nicaraguan territorial waters and was about to enter the port of Corinto. Reports of violations of Nicaragua's airspace reinforced this image of hostile U.S. intent.  Nicaragua responded on the 9th by requesting an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. Its fears and complaints of an imminent U.S. invasion were discussed, but the Council did not pass a resolution.  The crisis began to wind down the same day. Moscow announced that the Bukuriani was not carrying MIG-21s. U.S. officials quickly confirmed the Soviet statement. On the 12th the U.S. State Department issued a categorical statement that no preparations were being made to invade Nicaragua. This terminated the crisis for Nicaragua and the U.S., even though the Sandinista government issued an emergency communiqué the same day putting its people on "maximum alert" for a possible invasion. There was no violence in this crisis.  As noted, both superpowers were involved, the U.S. as a direct participant, the USSR passively. The UN Security Council provided a forum for debate, but no more. And the OAS, the regional organization of the Americas, was aloof.  (It was later reported by Jane's Defense Weekly that the Soviet vessel en route to Nicaragua had been carrying MIG-21s but had unloaded them in Libya before crossing the Atlantic. Still later, the International Court of Justice ruled that it did have jurisdiction in this case, and it "slapped the United States on the wrist" for its hostile acts against Nicaragua.)
The United States experienced a crisis with North Korea from 15 to 26 April 1969 over the shooting down of a U.S. reconnaissance plane. The U.S. and North Korea had fought a bitter and costly war from 1950 to 1953 (see Cases #132, #133, #140--Korean War I, II, III, in Korea PC). Fifteen years later, they experienced another crisis, arising from North Korea's seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo and the capture of its crew in what the U.S. claimed was international waters (see Case #224--Pueblo, in Korea PC): that crisis began on 22 January 1968 but dragged on until December, less than four months before the outbreak of a new crisis between the two long-time adversaries. On 15 April 1969 a U.S. navy EC-121 reconnaissance plane with 31 men aboard was shot down by a North Korean aircraft over the Sea of Japan. In a radio broadcast North Korea claimed that the plane was flying deep into its territorial airspace. The U.S. countered with a statement that the plane had never left international airspace and responded with the dispatch into the Sea of Japan of Task Force 7--29 ships, including four aircraft carriers. In Washington, an ad hoc group of the National Security Council was formed to recommend to the president alternative ways to deal with the crisis. (This group was the beginning of the Washington Special Action Group [WSAG], organized by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to assist in crisis management.)  The options presented to President Nixon ranged from diplomatic protests to strong military retaliation, for U.S. credibility and its influence as a superpower were perceived to be at stake. President Nixon ordered the resumption of reconnaissance flights accompanied by armed escorts, and the redisposition of the strong U.S. naval force into the Sea of Japan. The Soviet Union became involved early in the crisis when the Nixon administration requested Moscow's assistance, along with that of Japan and South Korea, in the search for the plane and its missing crewmen. On 22 April the USSR issued a mild protest against U.S. activity in the Sea of Japan. The crisis ended on 26 April when the U.S. naval task force was moved from the Sea of Japan into the Yellow Sea, after no further incidents occurred.  The UN remained aloof during this crisis.
Sweden and the USSR were enmeshed in a crisis from 28 October to 6 November 1981 over the unauthorized entry of a Soviet submarine into a restricted Swedish military zone. The Soviet Union was heavily engaged in international crises elsewhere when the U-137 crisis occurred: in Afghanistan (see Case #303--Afghanistan Invasion, in 1979-80, in Asia: Non-PCs); and in Poland (see Case #315--Solidarity, in 1980-81, in Europe: Non-PCs). Nor was this the first--or the last--Soviet penetration of Sweden's territorial waters: on 18 September 1980 an unidentified (probably Soviet) submarine infiltrated and withdrew by 6 October. On 28 October 1981 a Swedish fisherman discovered a submarine near the naval base of Karlskrona in southern Sweden, a restricted military zone. The "whiskey-class" submarine had become wedged on the rocks; hence the alternative name of this crisis--"Whiskey on the Rocks." Sweden responded the same day with a protest note to Moscow by its foreign minister. The Soviet ambassador in Sweden explained that the submarine was unable to leave because of "technical problems" and sought permission for a Soviet rescue operation.  A Swedish ad hoc crisis decision-making group, comprising the prime minister, foreign minister, supreme commander of the armed forces, permanent under-secretary of foreign affairs, and others, also decided the following on the 28th: to turn down a request for the entry of Soviet rescue ships; to prevent any contact between Soviet embassy personnel in Stockholm and the crew of the submarine; and to have the national research defense agency inspect the submarine, for nuclear material was suspected. That cluster of decisions triggered a crisis for the USSR. Moscow perceived a multifaceted threat: to its superpower image; to its influence among nonaligned states; to its relations with Sweden; and to its image for probity regarding nuclear material.  At a meeting of Sweden's crisis group on the 29th preparations were made for possible violence in the Karlskrona area. However, it ruled out the use of force against the submarine for the time being. Foreign Minister Ola Ullsten told the Soviet ambassador the same day that Sweden had the right to question the submarine commander, to investigate the incident, and to conduct rescue operations. He also demanded an apology for the violation of Sweden's territorial waters. And he rejected a request to permit Soviet representatives to visit the submarine.  Swedish leaders left Stockholm for a quiet weekend in order to convey the impression that the situation was under control. On 1 November, the Prime Minister, Thorbjorn Falldin, briefed the Opposition leader, Olof Palme. An alert was announced on the 2nd because of a reported approach of Soviet vessels. And top-level consultations were held on the nuclear issue: Swedish experts believed that the crippled submarine contained nuclear weapons. The submarine commander was interrogated the same day. And the next day Swedish experts inspected the submarine.  On 2 and 3 November the Soviet ambassador conveyed Moscow's irritation at Sweden's behavior and the prolonged interrogation of the submarine commander, as well as its "aggressive tone." On the 4th the Soviet ambassador neither confirmed nor denied the presence of nuclear weapons in the submarine. This aspect of the crisis remained ambiguous throughout, with Sweden avoiding a direct accusation to that effect.  The Soviet Tass news agency reported the incident for the first time on 4 November, describing it as an "accidental violation of Sweden's sovereignty." More Soviet ships were detected approaching the crisis area; and a second Swedish protest note was dispatched. Sweden's decision to release the submarine was made on 5 November. Due to weather conditions, it departed on the 6th, terminating the crisis for both states. On the 11th Moscow apologized to Sweden. It was viewed by Sweden at the time as its most serious foreign policy crisis of the postwar era.  The UN and the U.S. were not involved in this crisis.  (In February 1995, Sweden's premier confirmed that most intrusions into its territorial waters during the preceding 20 years were minks--which generated sound patterns similar to those of submarines--not Soviet subs!)
