CRISNO 137

CATALINA AFFAIR

Background:

The crisis for Sweden began on 16 June 1952. The exact termination date is unknown but was probably sometime in July 1952.

Background Sweden, separated from the USSR by Finland and the Baltic Sea, maintained its neutrality during the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939 (see Case #76--Finnish War, in Finland/Russia PC) and during World War II.

Swedish-Soviet relations after 1945 were cautious, but correct. In February 1952 a spy ring working in the service of the USSR was uncovered in Sweden.

Summary:

On 16 June 1952 two Soviet fighters shot down a Swedish Catalina flying boat that was taking part in a search for a Swedish training plane that had disappeared with its crew of eight men three days earlier. In response, Sweden placed its army on alert on the 18th. An exchange of Notes between the two countries followed. On 19 June several members of the Soviet embassy in Stockholm left Sweden to return to Moscow. The following day the Swedish foreign minister interrupted a visit to Italy to return home. There was no precise termination date: it was determined as sometime in July after the fourth and last Note relating directly to the crisis was sent by Sweden. There was no reply from the USSR, implying a tacit understanding to let the matter drop.

The incident was condemned by the United States in a statement by Secretary of State Dean Acheson.

There was no UN involvement.
