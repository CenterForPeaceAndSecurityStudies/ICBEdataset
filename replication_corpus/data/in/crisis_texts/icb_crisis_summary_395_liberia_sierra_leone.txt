CRISNO 395

LIBERIA-SIERRA LEONE

Background:

Sierra Leone experienced a foreign policy crisis from 23 March to 31 October 1991.

Background Sierra Leone's crisis was a direct spillover from Liberia's lengthy, complex civil war, which began in 1989. Several groups vied for power in a conflict that wrecked havoc in Africa's oldest independent state: President Samuel Doe, backed by Liberia's army; the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor; and a small rebel armed group controlled by Prince Yormie Johnson. After Doe's murder on 11 September 1990, the remnants of his forces came under the command of Nimely David, head of the presidential guard. Moreover, there was an interim government of Liberia headed by Amos Sawyer, an academic and lawyer, based in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone; and there also was the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), also based in Freetown and supported by Libya.

Summary:

A crisis for Sierra Leone was triggered on 23 March 1991 when 25 people were killed on its territory in a cross-border raid by Taylor's troops. Burkina Faso, which provided the NPFL with military and logistical assistance, was perceived as the source of threat to its territory by Sierra Leone's President, Joseph Saidu Momoh.

Sierra Leone responded at once by dispatching 2,000 troops to the border area; and on 31 March they occupied part of Lofa County in Liberia. Heavy fighting in April and May led to the killing of an estimated 3,000-5,000 Sierra Leone civilians and Liberian refugees by the NPFL--which denied any involvement. By mid-May NPFL forces had penetrated 150 kilometers into Sierra Leone's territory.

The first of four summit meetings held by ECOWAS, intended to terminate Liberia's civil war, were held on 30 June at Yammoussoukro in the Ivory Coast, attended by the leaders of Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Togo, but to no avail. By 7 September all Liberian rebel forces had been expelled from Sierra Leone's territory.

At the fourth summit meeting, held on 29-31 October 1991 in the Ivory Coast, an agreement was reached. The NPFL agreed to surrender the territory it controlled within Liberia to ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group), a creation of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), a regional organization that played a crucial role in abating the crisis (see below). All foreign forces in Sierra Leone were to withdraw immediately; and a buffer zone between Liberia and Sierra Leone was to be created. This (temporary) suspension of the civil war in Liberia marked the end of Sierra Leone's crisis. Thereafter, when civil strife resumed in Liberia, it did not spill over the Sierra Leone border. (Liberia's civil war began to wind down in November 1994.)

ECOWAS provided an important mediation role at the summit meetings. Mediators were able to keep the border dispute at the top of the agenda, and they not only served as intermediaries between the two crisis actors, but they also helped the negotiation process between the rebel groups within Liberia. The final plan that the ECOWAS mediators presented and which led to the termination of the crisis was one proposed by U.S. President Carter earlier.

Besides the mediation that led to crisis termination, ECOWAS was involved in additional ways. In August 1990 it sent a multinational force (ECOMOG) to Liberia, 4,000-5,000 troops, mostly Nigerians and, secondarily, Ghanaians, to impose a cease-fire. In November 1991 ECOMOG, now about 8,000, separated the warring factions in Liberia, thereby facilitating the elusive quest for a political solution. In short, the regional organization attempted mediation, contributed peacekeepers, and served as an observer force. Some west African states were involved in Liberia's civil war outside of ECOMOG: Burkina Faso, as noted; and the Ivory Coast and Togo, which provided passive support to the NPFL.

Superpower involvement in this crisis was minimal to nil. On 12 April 1991 Sierra Leone sought--but did not receive--U.S. military assistance. Washington's role was confined to a diplomatic effort to end the civil war: its Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman Cohen, brokered a truce on 22 September 1991. The USSR and the UN were completely uninvolved.

(The lengthy civil war in Liberia, with an estimated 150,000 killed since December 1989, appeared to be winding down in August-September 1995; following an ECOWAS-brokered peace accord, signed on 19 August by all the militias, a temporary coalition government of the contending factions was formed in Monrovia on 1 September. However, renewed factional strife and the flight of thousands of refugees at the end of 1995 and in early January 1996, and still another major eruption of violence in April-May 1996, leading to a descent into anarchy in Monrovia, revealed the fragility of the Liberia peace accord. In 2003, Liberia began transitioning to a power-sharing government after a rebel uprising and considerable pressure from the U.S. forced Charles Taylor to abdicate power and flee to Nigeria.)

(Sierra Leone, too, experienced internal turmoil from 1991 to 2001. After a series of peace agreements between the Sierra Leone government and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), with direct participation of UN and Nigerian peace keeping forces, successful disarmament of the RUF rebels was realized in early 2002.)
