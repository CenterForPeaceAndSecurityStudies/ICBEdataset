CRISNO 215

DOMINICAN INTERVENTION

Background:

A crisis for the United States in Central America began on 24 April and ended on 31 August 1965.

Pre-crisis In December 1962, more than a year after the assassination of its long-time dictator, Rafael L. Trujillo, the first free elections in 38 years were held in the Dominican Republic. Juan Bosch was inaugurated as President in February 1963. In September military officers, alleging communist control of the civilian regime, staged a coup. Donald Reid y Cabral acted as puppet President while real power lay in the hands of a three-man military junta.

Summary:

A crisis for the United States was triggered on 24 April 1965 when Bosch supporters overthrew the junta. Civil war broke out immediately. U.S. embassy personnel cabled President Johnson that American lives were in danger. The United States responded on 28 April with a decision to send 400 army paratroops and marines to the island. By 2 May the U.S. force was 14,000 and by 20 May 22,000. All foreign citizens were evacuated. The next day Johnson assigned U.S. military units the task of restoring order. On 30 April the U.S. called for an OAS meeting.

While fighting continued, intense diplomatic activity was taking place within the OAS and the UN, as well as bilateral U.S./Dominican negotiations. An OAS resolution called for a cease-fire, mediation, and the dispatch of an Inter-American Peace Force to the Dominican Republic. In the Security Council, Cuba and the USSR charged the United States with military intervention in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic. A mild Security Council resolution on 14 May called for a cease-fire and authorized the Secretary-General to take appropriate action. U Thant appointed Dr. José Antonio Mayobri as his Personal Representative.

OAS Secretary General Jose Mora began mediating between the U.S.-backed military junta and Bosch’s constitutionalist party on 30 April 1965. Since the U.S. had significant influence within the OAS, the mediation was potentially biased. Nonetheless, the mediation led to a compromise in late June that was agreeable to the junta, the constitutionalists and the U.S. "The Act of Dominican Reconciliation," signed on 31 August 1965, ended four months of civil war and, with it, the international crisis. All sides compromised by agreeing on Garcia-Godoy, a moderate, as provisional president.

(Further military incidents occurred in late 1965 and 1966. Free elections were held once more, in June 1966, in which Joaquín Balaguer defeated Juan Bosch and was elected President of the Dominican Republic.)
