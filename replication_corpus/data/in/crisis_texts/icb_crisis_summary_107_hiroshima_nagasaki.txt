CRISNO 107

HIROSHIMA-NAGASAKI

Background:

Japan's final intrawar crisis began with the dropping of the first U.S. atom bomb on 6 August 1945 and terminated with its formal surrender on 2 September 1945.

Pre-crisis Prime Minister Koiso, who had succeeded Tojo in July 1944, resigned on 8 April 1945. He was replaced by Admiral Suzuki, whose mission was to bring the war to an end, though the Japanese government and people were still committed publicly to continued resistance.

After the collapse of Germany in May (see Cases #94--D-Day and #100--Final Soviet Offensive), the Japanese were left without allies, and British and U.S. efforts concentrated on the Pacific theater. U.S. aircraft destroyed or immobilized the remnants of the Japanese navy and shattered Japan's industry. United States battleships shelled densely populated cities, and the air force dropped 40,000 tons of bombs on Japanese industrial centers in one month. Japanese morale began to disintegrate. On 20 June the emperor summoned the Supreme War Council and indicated his wish to seek peace with the Allies and to approach the Soviet Union with a request for mediation.

The Potsdam Conference began on 17 July 1945 with Churchill, Stalin, and Truman participating. The final text of their communiqu√©, dated 26 July, called for Japan's "unconditional surrender," while avoiding all mention of the future of the emperor, implying that the Allies would determine whether he would remain after the surrender. Japanese military forces would be disarmed, and Japan would be deprived of its imperial conquests. The Potsdam Declaration specified that Japan would be welcomed back into the international community and that the occupation would end after the Allies had accomplished their objectives and the Japanese had chosen a responsible government by democratic means. "The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction." Japan's prime minister, foreign minister, and navy minister were in favor of accepting the terms, but the war minister and the chief of staff were opposed.

Summary:

A grave intrawar crisis for Japan was triggered on 6 August when an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Three-fifths of the city was destroyed. Japan's crisis was compounded on the 8th when the Soviet Union declared war and launched a major invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria. A continuing threat to Japan's existence as a state was manifested on the 9th, with the dropping of another nuclear bomb on Nagasaki. The same day the inner cabinet in Tokyo appealed to the emperor for a final expression of his wish. The emperor opted for peace. On the l0th Japan made an offer of surrender on the basis of the Potsdam Declaration, but on condition that it did not comprise "any demand which prejudices the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler."

The U.S. government refused to accept any such condition and replied with the formula: "from the moment of surrender, the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers ... " After lengthy consideration Japan, once again following the lead of the emperor, decided to surrender despite the rejection of a condition that had been considered essential. On 15 August the emperor told the Japanese nation that the war was at an end. The Suzuki cabinet resigned, and the formal terms of surrender were signed on 2 September aboard the U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Bay, ending the war and the final intrawar crisis for Japan.

The Japanese home islands were placed under the rule of a U.S. army of occupation. The emperor remained as head of state. And the Japanese political and police officials continued to function. The capitulation of Japanese forces in China took place on 9 September. And China regained sovereignty over Inner Mongolia and Manchuria, as well as the islands of Formosa and Hainan. Hong Kong was reoccupied by the British, who accepted the formal Japanese surrender at Singapore on 12 September 1945.

(A debate has raged for 50 years over the U.S. decision to employ atomic bombs in the closing days of World War II. Some, notably those who made the decision [President Truman and the U.S. defense establishment, and their defenders], argued that it was necessary in order to save half a million Americans or more who would have been killed in a frontal invasion of Japan's home islands. Others, led by revisionist historians of the origins of the Cold War, have argued that Japan would have surrendered before the end of 1945 even if atomic bombs had not been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki--and that the most senior U.S. decision makers knew this at the time.)
