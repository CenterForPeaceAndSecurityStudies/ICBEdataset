CRISNO 10

BESSARABIA

Background:

The borderland of Bessarabia (Moldavia, later Moldova) was the focus of a crisis between Russia and Romania from 30 April 1919 to 2 March 1920.

Background Bessarabia had a long history of foreign occupation, from the time the Bulgars, a Turkic people, settled there in 679 A.D.: the Mongols (1241); Lithuania (1396); Russia (1812); Turkey (1856); and Russia once more (1878).

The breakdown of law and order at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution led the provincial government in Bessarabia in late December 1917 to request both the Romanian government and the Russian army's GHQ to dispatch troops to the area. Romania did so; and its forces occupied Kishinev, capital of Bessarabia, on 13 January 1918. Bessarabia proclaimed its independence on 24 January, but it was not recognized by the powers.

Russia responded to Romania's military intervention by severing diplomatic relations with Bucharest on 13 January and insisting that Romanian troops be withdrawn from Bessarabia. Romania refused; and its military presence was backed by a Note in early February from the senior representatives of France, Greece, Italy, the U.K., and the U.S. to the Rumtcerod, or governing body in Odessa, as a measure designed to restore order; the question of sovereignty over Bessarabia was left open. Tension rose on 27 March and again on 9 April 1918, when the legislatures of Romania and Bessarabia passed an act of union. Chicherin, the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, protested to Bucharest on 27 March. (The events from 13 January to 27 March 1918 constitute a separate Russia/Romania crisis, but it is not treated as such here because it ended before November 1918, the onset of the ICB data set.)

Pre-crisis Tension between Romania and Soviet Russia remained high during the next 12 months. This was exacerbated by two acts of formal recognition: of the Bessarabia-Romania union by the Central Powers in the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918; and of the Bessarabia-Romania "confederation" by the Hetmanate, or governing body, of independent Ukraine in June 1919 after initial opposition.

Summary:

Persistent tension escalated to international crisis when Romania formalized the union with Bessarabia on 30 April 1919. Russia perceived a serious threat to territory that had been internationally recognized as part of Russia in 1812 and again in 1878. It responded on 1 May with an ultimatum from Chicherin and Rakovsky, Chairman of the Council of Commissars for Soviet Ukraine, which triggered a crisis for Romania: Bucharest was given 48 hours to evacuate Bessarabia, or the Soviet regimes would act as they saw fit. Russia followed this with a declaration of war against Romania on 18 May. Serious clashes occurred but there was no decisive outcome, for the Red Army, faced with civil war against the "Whites," was unable to mount a concerted offensive against Romanian troops in Bessarabia. The military stalemate led to bilateral talks in early February 1920, though Romania refused to discuss the union with Bessarabia. An armistice was signed on 2 March ending the Bessarabia crisis, though not the long-standing conflict. The outcome was a victory for Romania, a defeat for Russia.

The League of Nations, whose Council first met less than two months before the end of this crisis, was not involved.

(Negotiations on a settlement of the basic dispute over territory broke down at the end of October 1920 following recognition of the Bessarabia-Romania union by France, Italy, Japan, and the U.K. on 28 October--though this treaty was not ratified until 1924 by Britain and France, and 1927 by Italy. The USSR formally recognized the loss of Bessarabia to Romania on 9 June 1934. However, it was occupied by Soviet troops on 28 June 1940 in accord with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 dividing eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. After German occupation during World War II Bessarabia was reoccupied by Soviet forces in 1944 and was ceded by Romania in 1946. It remained part of the USSR until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it emerged as the independent state of Moldova.)
