CRISNO 282

OGADEN II

Background:

The continuing dispute over the territory of Ogaden generated another crisis between Ethiopia and Somalia from 22 July 1977 to 14 March 1978.

Background After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, the marxist ruling group in Addis Ababa, the Derge, turned to Moscow for military support. From 1977 a large contingent of Cuban troops was stationed in Ethiopia to assist the marxist regime against its domestic enemies and Somali irredentism. Somalia responded by realigning with the United States.

The revolution of 1974 that overthrew the monarchy in Ethiopia also generated an upsurge of competing regional nationalisms. Brutal repression was practiced by the Mengistu regime. Ten out of Ethiopia's 14 provinces were in a state of armed insurrection against the central government in Addis Ababa. Its failure to suppress the revolt in Eritrea, along with the hostility of Ethiopia's other neighbors, was perceived in Mogadishu as an opportunity to realize the long-standing Somali goal of liberating Ogaden.

Summary:

On 22 July 1977 the Somalia-backed Western Somalia Liberation Front (WSLF) mounted a full-scale attack in the Ogaden region, triggering a crisis for Ethiopia. Within days most of Ogaden was overrun; and Somali troops pushed on to capture a score of Ethiopian posts on the outskirts of the Ogaden Desert. Ethiopia responded on 7 August by severing diplomatic relations with Somalia. By October, 90 percent of the Ogaden had been captured by Somali forces: Somalia was on the threshold of total victory.

At that point the Soviet Union came to the aid of Ethiopia with an airlift of weapons. And after Somalia broke relations with the USSR and Cuba, the Soviets poured air force and army advisors, along with thousands of Cuban troops from Angola, into Ethiopia.

The counteroffensive by Ethiopian and Cuban forces began on 21 January 1978, triggering a crisis for Somalia. Jijiga, which had fallen to the Somalis in September 1977, was retaken in early March 1978; and, despite U.S. military aid, the Somalis were now a broken force. The dramatic Ethiopian breakthrough was masterminded by the Cubans and Soviets. On 9 March Somalia announced its intended withdrawal from the Ogaden region, conceding victory to Ethiopia. The withdrawal was completed on 14 March 1978, terminating the crisis--but not the protracted conflict--for both states.

The OAU's mediation committee, created in 1973, attempted to mediate during the crisis unsuccessfully. On 8-9 August 1977, delegates from the OAU met with Somali and Ethiopian leaders. The mediators reaffirmed the inviolability of borders from the colonial era, which caused the Somali representation to be dissatisfied and walk out of the negotiations. Somalia also turned down all additional attempts at mediation.

The U.S. provided Somalia with weapons. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
