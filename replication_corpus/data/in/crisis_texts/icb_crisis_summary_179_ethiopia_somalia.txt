CRISNO 179

ETHIOPIA-SOMALIA

Background:

A crisis for Ethiopia began on 26 December 1960 and faded after about a year, with no fixed termination date.

Summary:

On 26 December 1960, 7,000 Somali tribesmen surrounded an Ethiopian police garrison and launched a heavy attack. The Ethiopian response occurred on the 29th when military units, including the air force, invaded Somalia, forcing the tribesmen to retreat. A strong protest was sent from Ethiopia to Somalia. The crisis continued with accusations, violence, and clashes for several months thereafter. During January 1961 Ethiopia bombed Somalia; there were clashes between their forces in Haud; Somalia postponed an oil shipment to Ethiopia; and the leader of the nationalist movement in Somalia warned of an imminent war. On 5 February there was a Somali invasion of Ethiopia with propaganda distributed in the disputed province. The All-African People's Conference of 1961 decided in favor of Ethiopia. In May, at the Monrovia Conference, an appeal was made to both sides to renew their efforts for a settlement. On 25 August talks were held between President Osman of Somalia and Emperor Haile Selassie at the Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade. On 31 August clashes were reported once again between Somali tribesmen and Ethiopians. And on 27 September there was an official complaint from Somalia that the dispute was not yet solved.

The superpowers maintained a neutral stance in the 1960 crisis. The UN was not involved. And the OAU was not yet in existence.
