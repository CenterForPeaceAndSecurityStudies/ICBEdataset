CRISNO 204

DAHOMEY-NIGER

Background:

On 21 December 1963 a crisis began for Niger and Dahomey, lasting until 4 January 1964.

Background Civil disorder preceded a military revolt in Dahomey that replaced President Hubert Maga with the Commander of the Army, Colonel Soglo. A provisional government was set up on 29 October 1963. There was also a sharp increase in labor strikes and regime repression prior to the onset of the crisis. Since 1960 the government of Niger was in the hands of the authoritarian President Hamani Diori, a friend and ally of Dahomey's former president. The conflict originated with a dispute over ownership of the tiny island of Lete on the Niger River, which forms the frontier between the two countries.

Summary:

On 21 December 1963 the National Assembly of Niger alleged that Dahomey was preparing to send troops to occupy Lete Island. Niger's response to this perceived threat, and the trigger for Dahomey, was an announcement on 22 December of the imminent expulsion of 16,000 Dahomeyans residing and working in Niger. President Soglo, on 27 December, responded with an order to close Dahomey's rail and road links to Niger, thus cutting off the Dahomeyan port of Cotonou from landlocked Niger. Both sides sent forces to the border but were deterred from military hostilities by French warnings. On 4 January delegations from both countries met at the frontier and issued a joint communiqu√© reopening the road and withdrawing forces. Mediation efforts -- involving delegations from Gabon, Togo, and Nigeria, and a proposal by the President of the Union Africaine et Malagache, President Yameogo of Upper Volta -- contributed to crisis abatement.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
