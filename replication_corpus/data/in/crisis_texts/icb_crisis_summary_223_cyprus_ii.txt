CRISNO 223

CYPRUS II

Background:

Another crisis over the Mediterranean island-state, among Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, broke out on 15 November and ended on 4 December 1967.

Pre-crisis The cease-fire of August 1964 was breached in 1967 in a clash between Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot forces.

Summary:

The crisis trigger for Turkey was an attack by the Greek-Cypriot National Guard against two Turkish-Cypriot villages on 15 November 1967. Turkey responded on the 17th with a resolution by its Grand National Assembly that authorized the government to decide upon the number and destination of armed forces to be dispatched to the area to deal with any new situation that might occur and to call for General Grivas, head of the Greek forces in Cyprus, to be sent home. This constituted the crisis trigger for Cyprus and Greece.

The Greek response was to recall Grivas for consultations on 19 November. Greece also indicated that it was ready to negotiate. On 22 November UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a message to the three states urging them to avoid war. Cyprus, on 24 November, called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council, which subsequently met and discussed the situation. Discussions between Greece and Turkey took place with Cyrus Vance, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, as mediator. Vance used shuttle diplomacy and placed heavy pressure on Greece to bring the conflicting parties to an agreement. In addition to Vanceâ€™s efforts, NATO and U.S. envoys served as secondary mediators in order to control this situation that was delicate to the West because of the powerful diplomatic presence of the Soviet Union. An agreement was reached on 1 December 1967 between Turkey and Greece. Cyprus signed on 4 December, terminating the crisis as a whole. Greece agreed to withdraw all troops from Cyprus that exceeded the number specified in the London and Zurich agreements of 1959-60. Turkey canceled large-scale preparations for an invasion of Cyprus.
