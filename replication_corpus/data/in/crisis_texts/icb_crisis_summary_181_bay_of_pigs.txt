CRISNO 181

BAY OF PIGS

Background:

Cuba and the United States were the adversaries in a crisis from 15 to 24 April 1961.

Background and Pre-crisis A series of incursions into Caribbean and Central American states, in which Cuba was perceived to be involved, took place in 1959-60 (see Cases #170--Central America/Cuba I and #178--Central America/Cuba II, in Americas: Non-PCs). In addition, the U.S. had become increasingly concerned about the strong ties that had developed between Cuba and the USSR. Relations between the U.S. and Cuba were strained; and the latter appealed to the Security Council at the end of 1960 charging the U.S. with plans to mount an invasion of Cuba using Cuban exiles trained in Guatemala. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken on 3 January 1961. In early April 1961 President Kennedy authorized an invasion of Cuba by the exiles, reasoning that, in the event of a failure, the remaining force would be able to establish guerrilla bases in the Cuban mountains. Support, or nonobjection to the invasion plans, was given to Kennedy by the CIA, the Defense Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States.

Summary:

On 15 April 1961 Cuban military and civilian centers were bombed by exiles flying U.S.-provided B-26 aircraft, triggering a crisis for Cuba. The U.S. crisis was triggered the same day when Cuba, at a meeting of the UN General Assembly, charged it with complicity in planning and financing the air attack. On the 17th Cuba responded with a declaration of a state of "national alert," an order to Cubans to fight, and a second appeal to the General Assembly charging the U.S. with aggression. While the United States ambassador to the UN denied the charge, the U.S. proceeded with support for the invasion on 18 April by an anti-Castro force made up of Cuban exiles.

A Note from the USSR to the U.S. on 18 April warned of a possible chain reaction to all parts of the globe arising from the invasion and reasserted Soviet support to Cuba to repel the attack. The U.S. responded that day through President Kennedy's answer to the Soviets: Kennedy emphasized that the U.S. "intends no military intervention" in Cuba, but would act to protect the hemisphere in case of military intervention by an outside force. The crisis ended for Cuba on 19 April when it defeated the invading force whose remnants were unable to escape to the mountains. It ended for the U.S. on the 24th when, reversing earlier disclaimers of U.S. involvement, the White House issued a statement by Kennedy assuming direct responsibility for the events leading to the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

A weak resolution was passed by the General Assembly calling upon all members to take action to reduce tensions.

(U.S./Cuba relations continued to deteriorate, the latter being supplied with weapons by the Soviet Union. In 1962 the much graver crisis over missiles in Cuba occurred [see Case #196].)
