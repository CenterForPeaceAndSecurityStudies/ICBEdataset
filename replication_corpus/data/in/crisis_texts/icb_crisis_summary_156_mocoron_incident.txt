CRISNO 156

MOCORON INCIDENT

Background:

Another crisis over territory between Nicaragua and Honduras lasted from 26 February until 9 May 1957.

Summary:

A second crisis between these Central American neighbors occurred 20 years after their Postage Stamp Crisis (see Case #57). Nicaragua perceived a threat on 26 February 1957 when Honduras began to organize the administration of the disputed area, including some sections over which Nicaragua had been exercising de facto control. On 18 April, after Nicaragua had strengthened its military presence in this area, its troops crossed the Coco River and occupied Mocorón, on the Honduran bank of the river. This triggered a crisis for Honduras, which responded by putting its army on alert and issuing orders to clean up the area around Mocorón. On 1 May the Mocorón area was recaptured by Honduran ground and air forces. Nicaragua's President Somoza ordered general mobilization.

The Council of the OAS met on 2 May to consider a Honduran charge of Nicaraguan aggression and appointed a five-person investigating committee. By the 5th the OAS committee succeeded in getting both parties to sign a cease-fire agreement. However, fighting--and the crisis--continued until 9 May 1957 when both states accepted a truce-cum-troop withdrawal plan, along with the creation of a military Observer Group along the border. While the OAS committee’s mediation effort helped bring about the truce and significantly reduced tensions between the adversaries, it did little in the way of resolving the territorial dispute. The dispute was submitted to the International Court of Justice which, in November 1960, ruled in favor of Honduras.

U.S. activity was channeled through the OAS. The UN and the USSR were not involved.
