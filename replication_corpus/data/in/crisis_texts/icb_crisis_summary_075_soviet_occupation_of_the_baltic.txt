CRISNO 75

SOVIET OCCUPATION OF THE BALTIC

Background:

A crisis for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania occurred between 26 September and 10 October 1939.

Background and Pre-crisis The three Baltic states had asserted their independence from Russia in November 1918 (see Case #4, Baltic Independence), and maintained their independence during the inter-world war period.

The German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 was followed by a Soviet invasion of that country on 17 September. By the end of that month Poland had been divided between Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviets occupied 77,620 square miles of eastern Poland. Lithuania and Slovakia received small parts of Polish territory. On 22 September the Estonian Foreign Minister, Karl Selter, went to Moscow for negotiations on economic issues. While there, a demand was made that Estonia sign a mutual assistance pact that would grant the USSR a naval base and airfields in the then-independent state. Foreign Minister Molotov threatened Selter that, if the Estonian government refused to comply, Soviet demands would be obtained through other methods.

Summary:

On 26 September 1939 Selter informed his government of the Soviet demands, triggering a crisis for Estonia. This was accompanied by extensive flights of Soviet aircraft over Estonian territory and rumors of large Russian troop concentrations along the border. Estonia responded on the 28th by complying with the demands thereby ending its crisis.

On 1 October the Latvian Foreign Minister, Wilhelm Munters, was summoned to Moscow for discussions. He arrived on the 2nd and held conversations with Stalin and Molotov. A crisis was triggered the next day when the Soviets made a series of demands under the threat of war. Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Joseph Urbsys, arrived in Moscow on the 3rd as well, to receive similar demands, triggering a crisis for Lithuania. Latvia, realizing that British or French assistance was out of the question at that time, and aware of the fact that 16 Soviet divisions were concentrated on the Latvian border, responded by signing a mutual assistance pact on 5 October. This marked the end of Latvia's crisis. The pact allowed the USSR to gain control over the Gulf of Riga and several air and naval bases. Thirty thousand Soviet troops were to be garrisoned in Latvia.

Negotiations between the USSR and Lithuania were conducted for a week after the trigger date, with Moscow applying severe pressure. The Soviet-Lithuanian Pact, ending the crisis, was signed on 10 October. It provided for the restoration of the city of Vilna to Lithuania and allowed the USSR to establish air and land bases and to maintain 20,000 troops in Lithuania. Lithuania, while viewing the return of Vilna with much satisfaction, had become a Soviet satellite.

By that time the League of Nations had become an empty shell.

(The Soviet [and, after 1991, Russian] occupation of the Baltic states lasted 54 years, with as many as 200,000 troops. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia became independent in 1992. The withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania was completed in 1993, and from Latvia and Estonia on 31 August 1994.)
