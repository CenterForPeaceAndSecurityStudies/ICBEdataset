CRISNO 169

MEXICO-GUATEMALA FISHING RIGHTS

Background:

A crisis between these two states lasted from 29 December 1958 to 1 February 1959.

Background Mexico observed a nine-mile territorial water limit off its shores while Guatemala regarded its own territorial waters as extending to 12 miles. Mexican fishers had been fishing for shrimp in what Guatemala considered its territorial waters.

Summary:

On 29 December 1958 the president of Guatemala articulated his perception of a crisis stemming from an economic threat from Mexico and warned it of impending attack if its fishers did not leave Guatemalan waters. Guatemala's response, and the trigger for Mexico, occurred on 31 December when Guatemalan planes strafed three Mexican shrimp boats off the Pacific coast, killing three fishers and wounding 14 others. Mexico's response was a severe protest to Guatemala on 3 January 1959. The crisis ended for Mexico on 12 January 1959, the day 200 Mexican shrimp boats began fishing in the same general area of the incident, after receiving an official promise from the Guatemalan government that its planes would not attack them. The termination date for Guatemala was 1 February 1959, the day the president of Mexico proposed a peaceful settlement with Guatemala and requested information about its terms for a settlement. Guatemala responded favorably.

The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
