CRISNO 110

COMMUNISM IN POLAND

Background:

The USSR experienced a crisis with Poland, from 30 June 1946 to 19 January 1947.

Pre-crisis The post-World War II situation in Poland was extremely tense as thousands of armed persons, belonging to various underground movements, aimed at sabotaging the Communist-controlled Lublin coalition government established in 1944. The presence of Soviet troops added to the complex environment.

Summary:

On 30 June 1946 the Provisional Government of Poland held a preelection referendum that pointed to the fact that the strongest political force in the country was Mikolajczyk's Peasant Party. This triggered a crisis for the USSR, which feared Poland's withdrawal from the Soviet bloc. The Polish Communist leaders were summoned immediately to Moscow for consultations. The major Soviet response came on 28 August when, at a meeting in Moscow with leaders of both the Polish United Workers Party (PUWP) and the Peasant Party, Stalin dictated the results of the forthcoming elections in Poland, demanding that Mikolajczyk ally his party with the Polish Communists.

On 19 January 1947 elections were held and were predictably won by the alliance of the PUWP and Peasant Party, despite charges of gross irregularities. As Poland's potential defection from the Soviet bloc had been prevented, the Soviet crisis was over.

The U.K. and the U.S. were involved politically with notes and statements vis-Ã -vis the elections and border issues. The UN was not involved. There was no violence.
