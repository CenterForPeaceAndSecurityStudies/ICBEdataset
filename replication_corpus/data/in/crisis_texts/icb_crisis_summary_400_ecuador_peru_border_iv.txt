CRISNO 400

ECUADOR-PERU BORDER IV

Background:

Ecuador and Peru experienced another crisis over territory from 6 to 15 October 1991.

Background The most recent flare-up in this protracted conflict over territory occurred near a Peruvian border post on the Corrientes River in January 1984.

Pre-crisis Tension between the two disputants rose in August 1991. On 30 September, at the UN, Ecuador's President Rodrigo Borja urged that Pope John Paul II be invited to mediate the dispute. (A South American precedent existed--a Vatican-mediated agreement between Argentina and Chile in 1984 that resolved their dispute since the mid-nineteenth century over the ownership of islands in the Beagle Channel [see Cases #287, #295--Beagle Channel I, II, in 1977-78, 1978-79, in Americas: Non-PCs].) On 2 October Peru's Defense Minister, General Torres, reaffirmed Lima's "trust" in the 1942 Rio Protocol, which had allocated the vast area in dispute to Peru. He also accused Ecuador of establishing a military post on Peruvian territory. The charge was rejected the next day by Ecuador's Defense Minister, Jorge Feliz, in a "we will not yield an inch" statement. This was echoed on the 5th by President Fujimori of Peru.

Summary:

A crisis for Ecuador was triggered by a perceived overflight of its territory on 6 October 1991 on the part of a Peruvian helicopter gunship. Ecuador responded the same day by suspending bilateral talks on the border then under way. This triggered a crisis for Peru. The threat of a serious military confrontation led the other three members of the five-state Andean Pact--Bolivia, Colombia, and Venezuela (along with Ecuador and Peru)--to urge a peaceful solution on the 8th. Ecuador accepted this initiative the next day, but Peru did not, calling, as always, for a solution "within the framework" of the 1942 Rio Protocol, that is, arbitration by its guarantors, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. Ecuador rejected the idea.

A meeting between the two foreign ministers on 10 October led to a statement, "we are on the right track." The crisis ended on 15 October, when the two sides withdrew their forces simultaneously from the border.

The UN and the USSR were not involved in this case.

(Another Ecuador/Peru crisis over the small, undemarcated part of their disputed border, approximately 130 square kilometers, occurred in late January and February 1995, with serious clashes and an estimated 80 soldiers killed and 200 wounded (see Case #413). A cease-fire was signed on 1 March; but the parties continued to resist pressure by the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol to negotiate the substantive issue in dispute. Further minor incidents occurred until the protracted conflict was finally resolved in 1998.
