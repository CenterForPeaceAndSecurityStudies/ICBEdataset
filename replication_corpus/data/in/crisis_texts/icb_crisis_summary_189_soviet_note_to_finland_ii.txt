CRISNO 189

SOVIET NOTE TO FINLAND II

Background:

Another crisis for Finland vis-Ã -vis the USSR occurred between 30 October and 24 November 1961.

Pre-crisis Cold war tensions resulting from the erection of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 (see Case #185, in Multiregional PCs: East/West) and the breakdown of disarmament talks in September contributed to Soviet concern about the January 1962 presidential and parliamentary elections in Finland. Five coalition parties had united to back the candidacy of Olair Honka for president and presented a serious challenge to incumbent President Kekkonen. The Soviets perceived the possibility of Kekkonen's defeat as a political threat that would affect Finland's neutrality and its general pro-Soviet foreign policy. Finland, always sensitive to the wishes of its giant neighbor, perceived a military threat from the Soviet Union if it deviated too much from previous policy.

Summary:

On 30 October 1961 a Note was sent by the Soviet Union to Finland calling for consultations between the two governments "to ensure the defense of both countries from the threat of a military attack by Western Germany and allied states." The Finnish response, on 7 November, was a decision to send Foreign Minister Karzalaimen for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. Further negotiations between Kekkonen and Khrushchev resulted in the termination of the crisis on 24 November 1961, postponing military consultations between the two countries.

There was no UN involvement in this crisis.

(In 1962 Kekkonen was re-elected to the presidency.)
