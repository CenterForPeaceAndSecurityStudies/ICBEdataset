CRISNO 90

EL ALAMEIN

Background:

The North Africa campaign, beginning with the Battle of El Alamein, was an intrawar crisis for Germany and Italy from 23 October 1942 to 13 May 1943.

Pre-crisis In the summer of 1942 a number of military victories were achieved by the Axis powers in North Africa. The British had been considerably weakened by their dispatch of 60,000 troops to Greece and had been forced to abandon recent conquests in Libya. On 21 June German General Rommel, commanding eight Italian divisions along with the Afrika Corps, captured Tobruk, the key to British defenses in North Africa. By the end of the month Rommel had moved toward the British-held stronghold at El Alamein in Egypt. When fuel shortages became extreme, the Italians were forced to halt their advance.

Summary:

On 23 October 1942 the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Montgomery, attacked from its position at El Alamein and broke through the Axis lines, triggering a crisis for Germany and Italy. The battle, which turned the tide of the war in North Africa, lasted 16 days.

A major British attack on 1-2 November succeeded in breaking through the southern sector of the front and overrunning the Italian divisions in the area. Rommel contacted Hitler's headquarters and informed him of his intention to withdraw while opportunity still prevailed. On 3 November Hitler ordered Rommel to stand fast and use all men and weapons available to defend the Axis position; the Italian response was similar. Rommel adhered reluctantly to the order. By the time permission for withdrawal was given the following day it was too late to save anything but the motorized divisions of the Panzer Army.

On 8 November, an Anglo-American force, commanded by General Eisenhower, disembarked in French Morocco and Algiers in an amphibious operation hitherto unequaled in history. Within three days Vichy French resistance had collapsed. The British headed toward Tunisia. Tobruk was reoccupied on 12 November and Benghazi on the 20th--by British forces advancing from Egypt into Libya.

From 17 to 27 January Churchill, de Gaulle, and Roosevelt met in Casablanca. Eisenhower took command of the unified Allied North African operations. The British Eighth Army broke through the Mareth Line into southern Tunisia and met the advancing U.S. Second Army Corps on 8 April. The termination of the crisis for Germany and Italy was 13 May 1943 when all German and Italian troops in North Africa surrendered.
