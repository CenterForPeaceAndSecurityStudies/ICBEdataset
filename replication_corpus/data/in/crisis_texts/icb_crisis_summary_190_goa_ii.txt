CRISNO 190

GOA II

Background:

A second crisis for Portugal over Goa lasted from 11 to 19 December 1961.

Pre-crisis There had been relative inactivity since Portugal's first crisis with India over Goa in 1955 (see Case #151). In April 1961 a bill was passed by the Indian Parliament enabling the merger of Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the Indian Union. During the debate Nehru stated that he did not rule out sending the Indian army into Goa. He repeated this warning in October. Meanwhile, Indian public opinion began demanding that more active steps be taken toward the integration of Goa. Tension between India and Portugal escalated with the reported buildup of Portuguese military strength in Goa, and, on 17 and 24 November, Indian ships were shot at from the Portuguese island of Anjadev. India announced, on 5 December, that precautionary troop movements were taking place. On 8 December Portugal charged that the Indian buildup threatened peace in the area and suggested that international observers be sent. Portugal appealed to the UN Security Council on 9 December.

Summary:

Portugal's crisis was triggered by a Nehru statement on 11 December that Indian patience was at an end and that he hoped the Portuguese would withdraw from Goa and the two smaller Portuguese enclaves, Damas and Diu. Portugal responded the same day by informing the UN Security Council that Indian forces were massing along the border and were ready to invade Goa.

On 12 December Portugal announced that it had decided to evacuate European women and children from the disputed area in view of an imminent Indian attack: information received by Portugal anticipated an attack on 15 December. On that day UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a message to the prime ministers of India and Portugal requesting them not to allow the situation to deteriorate and proposing negotiations. Salazar acceded to the Secretary-General's request, but Nehru replied with a demand that Portugal leave Goa.

On 18 December 1961 Indian troops entered Goa. Portugal called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council. A resolution was introduced by Portugal's Western allies calling for a cease-fire, Indian withdrawal, and a peaceful settlement but it was defeated by a Soviet veto. The United States strongly criticized India's action. President Kennedy sent a message to Nehru urging that no force be used--U.S. ambassadors to Delhi and Lisbon had succeeded in postponing the invasion date a number of times.

The crisis for Portugal ended on 19 December 1961 with the entry of Indian troops and the signing of a surrender agreement ending four centuries of Portuguese rule over Goa.
