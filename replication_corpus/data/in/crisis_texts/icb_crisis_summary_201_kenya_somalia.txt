CRISNO 201

KENYA-SOMALIA

Background:

Kenya experienced a crisis with Somalia from 20 November 1963 until 4 March 1964.

Background and Pre-crisis In March 1963 the U.K. announced that it would grant internal self-government to the British colony of Kenya after the local parliamentary elections of 18-26 May 1963. Despite a demand from the Somali population residing in the Northern Frontier District (NFD) to secede from Kenya and unite with Somalia, it was also announced that the NFD would become the seventh region of Kenya. On 18 March Somalia severed diplomatic relations with the U.K. On 1 June Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya's first Prime Minister. The elections were boycotted by the Somali tribespeople of the NFD. In addition, Somali secessionists carried out a series of protest raids on military and police posts in the territory--according to a statement by Kenyatta, 33 attacks until 13 November. The Kenya government banned nonessential travel to the area and issued a statement to the effect that Kenya would not give up an inch of the area.

Summary:

The Vice-President of Kenya's eastern region, Ahmed Farah, stated on 20 November that Somalia was preparing to attack Kenya and had already secretly distributed arms to Kenya's Somalis. Kenya, he warned, should be ready for war with Somalia after independence on 12 December 1963. This marked the crisis trigger for Kenya. Fearing a full-scale insurrection in the north, Kenyatta issued an order on 28 November that he wanted all Somali raiders captured, dead or alive.

Kenya's major response, on 25 December, was a proclamation of a state of emergency along the 440-mile NFD. A five-mile prohibitive zone was established along the entire frontier. The next day Kenyan troops were placed on full alert; and on the 29th the border with Somalia was completely sealed. British troops stationed in Kenya were also sent to back up Kenya's security forces. On 28 December a military delegation from Ethiopia arrived to confer with Kenyan officials on the Somali border crisis, and a mutual defense treaty was ratified.

In February 1964 Kenya requested that the dispute be placed on the agenda of the OAU Council of Ministers. On 12 February an OAU resolution was passed detailing steps to settle the dispute and requesting the sides to refrain from propaganda. On 25 February 1964 the Kenyan state of emergency in the NFD was extended for another two months; but by the time of the 4 March elections the crisis had ended. Secessionist Somalis in the NFD participated in the election for the regional assembly, thus indicating their--and Somalia's--willingness to drop their secessionist demands.

The superpowers maintained a neutral position, but Somalia was receiving military aid from the Soviet Union and therefore regarded it as an ally. The UN was not involved.

(By mid-1967 a Zambian initiative to mediate the continued low-level conflict succeeded when Kenyan and Somali leaders promised to cease provocative acts and restore normal relations.)
