CRISNO 118

JUNAGADH

Background:

The crisis between India and Pakistan over Junagadh took place from 17 August 1947 to 24 February 1948.

Summary:

The news of Junagadh's accession to Pakistan on 17 August 1947 triggered a crisis for India. New Delhi responded on 25 October by approving a plan to occupy Mangrol and Babariawad with civil personnel accompanied by a small military force. This triggered a crisis for Pakistan on 1 November 1947. After the nawab left Junagadh, its government formally requested India to assist in the administration. Accordingly, instructions were issued on 9 November to occupy Junagadh, marking the termination of India's crisis.

Pakistan's response on 11 November took the form of a reply by Liaquat Ali Khan to a cable from Nehru requesting a discussion on Junagadh. Pakistan's prime minister contended that, since Junagadh had already acceded to Pakistan, there was no room for discussion and that India's action was a clear violation of Pakistani territory. However, Pakistan was in no position to defend Junagadh because they were not contiguous and Junagadh was 300 miles from the sea. Pakistan's crisis ended on 24 February 1948 when a plebiscite was held in Junagadh, reinforcing India's control over the state.

The U.K. was deeply involved in this crisis. Lord Mountbatten, India's last viceroy and governor-general, held talks in Lahore with Liaquat Ali Khan and received Pakistan's agreement to hold a plebiscite in Junagadh. The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved.
