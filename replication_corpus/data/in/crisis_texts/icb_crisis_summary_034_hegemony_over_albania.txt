CRISNO 34

HEGEMONY OVER ALBANIA

Background:

Yugoslavia, Albania, and Italy were enmeshed in a crisis from 28 November 1926 until 22 November 1927.

Pre-crisis From the outset Italy and Yugoslavia had competed for influence over Albania, both regarding it as vital to their national security. Tension eased in 1924 with a Treaty of Friendship between them, the Pact of Rome. Albania was proclaimed a republic in January 1925. Its frontiers were fixed by a formal agreement among the most interested major and regional powers--France, Greece, Italy, the U.K., and Yugoslavia--on 30 July 1926.

Summary:

Tension rose dramatically on 27 November 1926 with the signing of the Treaty of Tirana by Italy and its Albanian protégé, Ahmed Bey Zog (who became King of Albania in 1928). Italy was granted the right to dispatch troops to Albania if the latter was invaded, thereby making Albania a de facto Italian protectorate.

The Treaty of Tirana triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia the following day. Belgrade was slow to respond: in February 1927 it ordered a general reorganization of the army and tested its mobilization capability. In mid-March Albania became a crisis actor perceiving Komitadji rebels massing on its frontier as under the control of Yugoslavia. Albania responded by sending troops to the border. And Yugoslavia's testing of its mobilization system created a crisis for Italy on 17 March.

Italy's pledge of support if Albania was invaded, supplemented by minor troop movements to the island of Saseno, neutralized the perceived threat from Yugoslavia to Albania and terminated the latter's foreign policy crisis on 23 March. For Yugoslavia the crisis ended with the enhancement of its security through a Treaty of Friendship with France on 11 November designed to counter Italy's aggrandizement in southeast Europe. And Italy's crisis, along with the international crisis over Albania, ended with the second Treaty of Tirana on 22 November 1927 that created a defensive alliance between Italy and Albania. Yugoslavia (and France) acquiesced in this reassertion of Italian primacy.

The U.K., Germany, Czechoslovakia, and, later, Japan were involved politically through efforts to ease tensions between Italy and Yugoslavia. The League of Nations Council offered to mediate the conflict, but Italy declined.

(The "special relationship" between Albania and Italy forged by the two treaties of Tirana [1926, 1927] and their 20-year defensive military alliance [1927] marked the beginning of an Italian protectorate over Albania lasting until World War II.)
