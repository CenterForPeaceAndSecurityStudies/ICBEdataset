CRISNO 247

TANZANIA-UGANDA II

Background:

A second crisis for Uganda and Tanzania began on 17 September 1972 and ended on 5 October of that year.

Background Military clashes between Uganda and Tanzania were reported for much of 1971. The two countries verged on a wider confrontation when Ugandan air force planes attacked border placements in Tanzania, triggering a crisis from 20 October until its termination on 25 November 1971 (see Case #245).

Summary:

On 17 September 1972 1,000 supporters of ex-President Obote in Tanzania invaded Uganda from Tanzania; no Tanzanian soldiers were among them. Idi Amin responded the following day by moving forces to the border region to meet the invasion and by bombing the town of Bukoba in Tanzania, triggering a crisis for Tanzania. Tanzania responded the same day by moving its Fourth Battalion of over 1,000 men to the border. Its crisis management technique was mediation, both through the OAU and Somalia.

By 24 September the Somali delegation, under the leadership of President Siad Barre, had developed a peace plan that both states found favorable. The termination date for both actors was 5 October 1972, when they signed the Mogadishu Agreement wherein both announced their intention to remove forces from the border area and to cease all military hostilities. Moreover, the two sides agreed to stop all hostile propaganda against each other and "to refrain from harboring or allowing subversive forces to operate in the territory of one state against the other." Somalia led a military observer mission to ensure compliance.

Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
