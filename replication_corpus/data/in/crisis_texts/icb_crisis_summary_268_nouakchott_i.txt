CRISNO 268

NOUAKCHOTT I

Background:

A Polisario attack on Mauritania's capital caused a one-day crisis for Mauritania on 8 June 1976.

Summary:

On 8 June 1976 a force of 600-700 Polisario guerrillas attacked the city of Nouakchott, threatening Mauritania's political regime. The attack took the form of a lightning mortar and machine-gun offensive with several mortar shells falling around the presidential palace of Ould Daddah, causing turmoil and panic in the city. The Mauritanian response came immediately after the firing when troops reportedly crushed the attacking forces, killing Polisario leader El-Ouali. The remaining Polisario troops withdrew after an hour, thus terminating the crisis on the day of the attack. Nouakchott was attacked a second time in March 1977.

Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN or the OAU, was active in this crisis.
