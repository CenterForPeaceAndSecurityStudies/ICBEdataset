CRISNO 133

KOREAN WAR II

Background:

A second, closely related international crisis during the Korean War lasted from 30 September 1950 to 10 July 1951. The crisis actors were North Korea, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and South Korea.

Pre-crisis In August 1950 the PRC warned the United Nations that it would retaliate if U.S. or ROK forces crossed the 38th Parallel. On 29 September the UN forces handed control of South Korea back to the civilian government headed by Syngman Rhee.

Summary:

On 30 September the Third Division of the ROK army crossed the 38th Parallel and advanced rapidly, triggering a crisis for North Korea. This threat was accentuated on 1 October by MacArthur's ultimatum to the DPRK demanding unconditional surrender. The same day Kim Il-Sung, the ruler of North Korea, appealed to Beijing for immediate military intervention to save his regime.

These three events triggered a crisis for the PRC, as evident in a secret decision by the Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo on 2 October to dispatch "Chinese Volunteers" to assist North Korea. The decision was taken under pressure from Stalin--but only after the PRC's leaders perceived a serious threat to the security of China and to the very existence of the DPRK. The crossing of the 38th Parallel by U.S. forces on 7 October escalated the stress level in Beijing--and triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. Mao issued the formal order to enter the Korean War on the 8th; but the PRC's military intervention, its major response to this crisis, did not occur until 19 October, after lengthy--and disappointing--consultations with Stalin. In response to Mao's telegram on the 2nd, conveying the decision to send "Chinese Volunteers" and warning of possible U.S. military retaliation against the PRC, Stalin initially pledged to dispatch fighters and bombers to North Korea. However, on the 9th, at a meeting with Zhou Enlai in Moscow, just two days after the direct entry of U.S. forces into North Korea, Stalin reneged: the USSR's major response, that day, was to promise military equipment for 20 PRC divisions engaged in the Korean War and to place its forces both in the Soviet Far East and in Manchuria on alert, pending further penetration by U.S. forces in the DPRK, which might bring U.S. troops closer to the Soviet border.

News of the crossing of the Yalu River by thousands of "Chinese Volunteers," initiated in secrecy, reached Washington in late October. Fighting between those forces and UN forces at the Battle of Unsan, triggering a crisis for the United States on 25 October 1950. By late November the Chinese had begun successful major attacks against UN forces. The U.S. response, on 30 November, was a statement by President Truman announcing that the United States was prepared to use whatever weapons it had in its arsenal to defeat the Chinese troops.

PRC and North Korean forces recrossed the 38th Parallel on 26 December 1950. That, along with heavy fighting in Seoul, triggered a crisis for South Korea. On 3 January 1951 UN and South Korean forces abandoned the capital, which was captured the following day. The reversal of the tide of battle terminated the crisis for the Soviet Union. Differences between President Truman and General MacArthur over the expansion of the war led to MacArthur's dismissal in the early spring of 1951. The UN forces recaptured Seoul on 14 March 1951. There was a PRC counterattack in late April, but by June the fighting stabilized around the 38th Parallel. A cease-fire and armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951, ending the crisis for North and South Korea, the PRC, and the U.S.

The USSR's use of its great power veto had effectively blocked UN Security Council action during this crisis and, therefore, the General Assembly became increasingly involved. On 7 October 1950 the Assembly created the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea (UNCURK). When the Security Council was unable to do so, a new resolution, the Uniting for Peace Resolution, was passed on 3 November, granting the General Assembly authority to take action on threats to peace and security when the Security Council was unable to fulfill this responsibility, a crucial element in the UN Charter. In December the Assembly created the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA) and a three-person group on a cease-fire. And on 1 February 1951 a resolution was passed by the General Assembly declaring the PRC to be an aggressor and demanding the withdrawal of its forces from Korea.
