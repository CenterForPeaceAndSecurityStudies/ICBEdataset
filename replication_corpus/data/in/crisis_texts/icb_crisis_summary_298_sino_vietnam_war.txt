CRISNO 298

SINO-VIETNAM WAR

Background:

A crisis between China (PRC) and Vietnam, which escalated to full-scale war, lasted from 25 December 1978 to 15 March 1979.

Background China and Vietnam were hostile neighbors for a thousand years. Most of what later became North and South Vietnam--Cochin China (from 1862) and Annam (from 1874)--was controlled by France through the first half of the twentieth century. Although Vietnam declared its independence in September 1945, French domination ended only after its defeat at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954 and the Geneva Agreement on Indochina soon after (see Case #145, in Indochina PC). From that point onward there were several incidents and disputes between China and Vietnam including armed conflict over the Paracel Islands in 1959 and 1974.

Pre-crisis Tension between China and Vietnam mounted in the summer of 1978. On 29 June Vietnam joined the Soviet bloc's economic community, COMECON. On 12 July China tightened border controls in order to stem the influx of refugees, which had reached 169,000 of the Hoa people fleeing Vietnam to China. Moreover, a significant military buildup occurred along the Sino/Vietnam border. The two countries edged toward full-scale war during the summer of 1978, while fighting continued during the autumn, followed by a break during the rainy season. In November Vietnam and the USSR signed a Treaty of Friendship, which pledged Soviet assistance in the event of an attack. And in December the continued drain on Vietnam's resources led to its decisive Invasion of Cambodia (see Case #284, in Indochina PC).

Summary:

Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia on 25 December 1978 triggered a crisis for China. Its response was a military incursion into Vietnam on 17 February and the occupation of several border villages. This, in turn, triggered a crisis for Vietnam.

Chinese troops met with stronger than anticipated opposition leading to a halt in military operations. They were resumed on the 23rd, after the invasion force had been enlarged to 200,000. Vietnam responded by launching two counterattacks into Chinese territory the same day. Fighting subsided on 5 March. A PRC government statement that day announced that the Chinese troops had attained their goal--"to punish the Vietnamese aggressor"--and would withdraw to Chinese territory; but the image of China's military embarrassment persisted. The same day the government of Vietnam issued a decree proclaiming general mobilization. Chinese troops were withdrawn from Vietnam by 15 March 1979 terminating the crisis for the PRC and Vietnam.

On 17 February, the day of the Chinese incursion, Vietnam urged the UN Secretary-General to take appropriate measures to put an end to China's "aggression" but did not request a formal session of the Security Council. On the 22nd the U.S., the U.K., Norway, and Portugal requested an urgent meeting of the Council to consider the situation in Southeast Asia. The five ASEAN countries (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) circulated a draft resolution calling for a halt to all hostilities in Indochina; but, as with the proposed resolution on Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, it was vetoed by the Soviets.

China's exercise in deterrence had mixed results: it was revealed as unable to prevent the toppling of a regime (in Cambodia) to whose support it was publicly committed; and it failed "to punish" Vietnam. At the same time China emerged in a stronger political position because the USSR abstained from participation in the war. And there was no apparent damage to the normalization of U.S./PRC relations, which had been strengthened in December 1978.
