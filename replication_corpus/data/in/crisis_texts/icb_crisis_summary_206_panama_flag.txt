CRISNO 206

PANAMA FLAG

Background:

Panama and the U.S. experienced a brief crisis over the Panama Canal Zone from 9 to 12 January 1964.

Background and Pre-crisis An "unequal" treaty, providing for U.S. control over the Panama Canal Zone and the Canal, was imposed on Panama in 1903. Persistent Panamanian opposition to the treaty for 60 years centered around the issues of full U.S. sovereignty over the Canal Zone, Panama's inability to fly its flag in the area, and inadequate payment, according to Panama, for unrestricted United States use of the Canal. As President Carter later acknowledged: "From the outset, Panamanians deeply resented this denial of their authority over part of their territory."

The flag issue was partly rectified in 1962 by an agreement that both flags would fly side by side at designated public sites. However, to reduce tension, the flying of both states' flags in front of Canal Zone schools was banned in December 1963.

Summary:

On 9 January 1964 a group of U.S. students in the Canal Zone raised the U.S. flag at Balboa High School. Massive rioting followed and was met by force: U.S. troops fired upon the Panamanian demonstrators, killing 26 and wounding 100, triggering a crisis for Panama.

The dramatic eruption of the crisis led Panama's President Chiari to break diplomatic relations with the United States the same day. He also filed a complaint with the OAS and the UN Security Council. Notification of these acts on 10 January triggered a U.S. crisis. The same day President Johnson responded by phoning Chiari to express his regret for the casualties and to call for joint efforts to restore calm. Chiari demanded a complete revision of all treaties affecting U.S./Panama relations. Johnson insisted that order must first be restored to the Canal Zone. He requested the OAS Peace Committee to investigate the matter. It took 48 hours to persuade the Panamanian president to agree to Johnson's proposal. When he did so, on 12 January, the crisis ended for both countries.

The UN was marginally involved in this crisis; the USSR was uninvolved.

(Diplomatic relations were restored on 3 April 1964. And soon after, the parties agreed to renegotiate the Panama Canal treaties, a process completed in 1979.)
