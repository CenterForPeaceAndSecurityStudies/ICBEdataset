CRISNO 208

OGADEN I

Background:

The first of several crises between Ethiopia and Somalia over Ogaden in the Horn of Africa lasted from 7 February until 30 March 1964.

Background These two traditional enemies had contested ownership of the Ogaden Desert long before Somalia became independent in 1960. The root cause was Somalia's deep-rooted disaffection and irredentism regarding the territorial map of East Africa, with large ethnic Somali populations under foreign control--in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Tanzania.

Since Somalia's independence in 1960 the creation of a "Greater Somalia," to include the then-French colony of Djibouti, the Northern Frontier District of Kenya, and, above all, the Ogaden Desert on its western border with Ethiopia, had been a firm and clearly stated aim of the Somalia government. The water and grazing resources of Ogaden were essential to the nomadic peoples of both countries. Ogaden, the core territorial issue, was a focus of interstate dispute since 1960: Ethiopia controlled it; and Somalia claimed it.

The protracted conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia was enmeshed in the East-West Cold War during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. From 1960 until 1974 Somalia was a military client of the Soviet Union, Ethiopia of the United States.

Pre-crisis Economic conditions were severe in Somalia preceding the crisis. In November 1963 the Soviet Union concluded a military aid agreement with Somalia. Border clashes occurred in January 1964.

Summary:

A crisis for Ethiopia was triggered on 7 February 1964 when military forces of the Republic of Somalia carried out a large-scale attack on the Ethiopian frontier post at Tog Wajale. Ethiopia responded during the next three days with the following: military resistance at the frontier post; a declaration of a state of emergency in the border region; a call for an immediate meeting of the OAU; and a strong protest by Ethiopia's foreign minister to the Soviet charg√© d'affaires in Addis Ababa. In addition, Emperor Haile Selassie addressed a message to all African heads of state informing them of the incident. Military clashes reportedly continued until 10 February. The Ethiopian retaliation on the 8th on Somali territory triggered a crisis for Somalia. Its response, on the 9th, was also multiple: resistance to the Ethiopian attack; a declaration of a state of emergency throughout Somalia; an accusation of Ethiopian penetration into Somali territory, presented to Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, and notification of the conflict to the OAU.

Somalia perceived the OAU members, many of whom experienced border disputes with their neighbors, as insensitive to its territorial claims. Success for Somalia, they feared, would constitute a precedent that would threaten the territorial integrity of other newly independent African states. Somalia looked upon the UN as a more friendly forum for its case. Thus on 10 February it requested a meeting of the Security Council, if the OAU failed to end the border dispute. Secretary-General U Thant appealed to the parties to settle the dispute peacefully. A cease-fire was accepted by them on 16 February but did not hold.

The crisis ended on 30 March 1964 with a cease-fire agreement along the original boundary, concluded in Khartoum. A joint border commission was established.

The U.S. was the major source of weapons for Ethiopia, as the USSR was for Somalia.

(Sporadic fighting continued for 10 days after the agreement. The territory in dispute--the Ogaden Desert--was retained by Ethiopia after the crisis ended. The persistent tension escalated to a full-scale crisis on several occasions later, in 1978 and 1980.)
