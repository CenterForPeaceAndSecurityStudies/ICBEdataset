CRISNO 100

FINAL SOVIET OFFENSIVE

Background:

An intrawar crisis for Germany in the East lasted from the beginning of the final Soviet offensive on 11 January until Germany's surrender on 7 May 1945. This crisis overlapped with the German IWC over the continuing Allied advance in Western Europe in 1944-45 (see Case #94--D-Day). Both ended with Germany's capitulation.

Pre-crisis The campaign was planned by the Soviets as a separate and well-defined offensive. The aim was to strike at the heart of the Third Reich. The Russian homeland had been liberated from Nazi conquest by July 1944; and by 29 August Soviet forces had reached the border of East Prussia. At this point they halted and deliberately did not penetrate German territory. Instead, they concentrated on the Baltic Peninsula and the Balkans. These areas were liberated in October and December of 1944. In January 1945 the Soviets turned their full attention to the planning of a two-pronged attack, against East Prussia in the north and Silesia in the center.

Summary:

An intrawar crisis for Germany was triggered on 11 January 1945 when the first part of the Soviet offensive began with a thrust from Poland into Silesia. For the first time Germany proper was threatened. The German response was immediate: they used every means available in order to halt the Soviet advance. On 13 January the second Soviet thrust advanced from Lithuania into East Prussia. By 1 February East Prussia had been conquered, and the Soviets advanced into Silesia capturing a long and broad front inside the eastern border of Germany along the Oder River from Zehden in the north to Ratibor in the south. By the end of March they held the entire area of eastern Germany. On 25 April 1945 the Soviets entered Berlin.

Meanwhile the Allies were advancing in western Germany, and the two armies met on the 25th. Thereafter, both armies converged on those parts of Germany that had not yet been conquered until the Third Reich finally collapsed and surrendered on 7 May 1945 to the Allied and Soviet Commands.
