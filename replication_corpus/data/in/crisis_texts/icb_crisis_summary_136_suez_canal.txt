CRISNO 136

SUEZ CANAL

Background:

This crisis lasted from 30 July 1951 to 30 January 1952 and involved two crisis actors, Egypt and the United Kingdom.

Background At the end of World War II Egypt had demanded the abrogation of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian treaty on the Suez Canal and its unification with Sudan. When Britain promised self-determination to Sudan, Egypt's relations with the U.K. worsened, and talks between the two countries to renew the treaty allowing a British presence in the Canal Zone ran into difficulties. A shift toward radicalization in Egypt's political life occurred.

Summary:

On 30 July 1951 a crisis was triggered for Egypt by the U.K.'s reaffirmation of its rights to the Canal under the 1936 treaty and a call for U.S. support. Cairo viewed this as an implied threat of force and an explicit threat to Egypt's sovereignty over the Canal Zone. Egypt's response, on 8 October 1951, which triggered a crisis for the U.K., was a draft proposal to the Egyptian parliament calling for the abrogation of the treaty and demanding British evacuation of the Suez Canal Zone. The U.K. responded on 16 October by declaring a state of emergency for its forces in Egypt and a decision to reinforce troops in the Canal Zone, as well as to prohibit the export of arms to Egypt. Attempts to force the evacuation of British troops by a popular resistance movement caused prolonged and serious clashes. Guerrilla warfare in Egypt against the British continued for some time until the country was in near-total disorder. Egypt's crisis ended on 27 January 1952 when King Farouk appointed a new government. The crisis for the U.K. ended on 30 January when the Egyptian prime minister called upon the British ambassador and agreed to resume talks.

The United States strongly supported the British position. The USSR was not involved. Egypt appealed to the UN in November 1951, and an inquiry committee was set up. (On 18 February 1952, subsequent to the crisis, a report was published that denied Egyptian allegations of Britain's use of forced labor to build its bases in Egypt.) The Political Committee of the Arab League passed a resolution on 3 September 1951 expressing full support for Egypt.
