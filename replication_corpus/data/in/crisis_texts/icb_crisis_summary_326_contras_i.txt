CRISNO 326

CONTRAS I

Background:

Honduras and Nicaragua experienced the first of their four crises in the 1980s from 28 April to 13 May 1981.

Background The last 15 years of the Honduras/Nicaragua protracted conflict were shaped by an internal struggle for power between the Sandinistas and the right-wing contras. This conflict has deep roots in Nicaragua.

The Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN) (Sandinista National Liberation Front) were the followers of General Agustino Sandino, who led anti-Conservative and anti-American insurrections from 1926 until his death in 1934. The "Sandinistas" triumphed over the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza (see Case #294--Nicaraguan Civil War, in Americas: Non-PCs). On 19 July 1979 they formed a provisional government, the first pro-Soviet regime in the Americas since Castro's triumph in Cuba 20 years earlier.

Almost from the moment the Sandinistas assumed power in Managua, U.S. antagonism led to financial support to the right-wing "National Resistance," better known as the "contras." From 1981 onward the contras launched cross-border raids against the Sandinista regime from sanctuaries in Honduras and Costa Rica, mostly the former. This was to generate interstate crises between Honduras and Nicaragua in 1981, 1986, 1988, and 1989.

Pre-crisis As soon as the Sandinistas achieved power in Nicaragua (see Case #294--Nicaraguan Civil War, in 1978-79, in Americas: Non-PCs), the contras began to mobilize funds and fighters, to organize in sanctuaries in Honduras and Costa Rica, and to induce border incidents between Nicaragua and its neighbors. Typical was the overflight of Honduran territory by Nicaraguan planes on 9 November 1980: Honduras claimed that it shot down two Nicaraguan planes in its Paraiso area; Nicaragua attributed the loss to its planes being "blown over the border by adverse winds."

In early April 1981 the Reagan administration cut off U.S. aid to the new regime in Nicaragua. And in the spring Honduran officers were expressing the view that "war with Nicaragua is unavoidable."

Summary:

A crisis for Honduras was triggered on 28 April 1981 by a Nicaraguan attack on a Honduran border post at Guasale, in search of contras. The same day troops of both states were placed on alert, and the border was closed. This catalyzed a crisis for Nicaragua. For Honduras it was perceived as a threat to territory, for Nicaragua, a threat to its political regime.

Clashes occurred on 3 May at el Tablazo and again on the 5th. On 7 May Nicaragua's defense ministry denounced Honduras for 120 acts of "aggression" and charged that Honduras disregarded five official notes of protest. Nonetheless, the same day a meeting was held between the Honduras President, General Policarpo Paz Garcia, and a senior Nicaraguan government official. After six days of negotiations a joint declaration was issued, emphasizing the willingness of the two adversaries to reduce the tension between them. This ended the low-intensity crisis of 1981.

There was no UN, U.S. or USSR involvement in this crisis.

(Although the contras were not directly involved in this crisis, their presence in the border area of Honduras was perceived by the Sandinista rulers of Nicaragua as a constant source of threat; and they were a catalyst to hostile acts by Honduras against Nicaragua [see also Cases #369, #383, #389].)
