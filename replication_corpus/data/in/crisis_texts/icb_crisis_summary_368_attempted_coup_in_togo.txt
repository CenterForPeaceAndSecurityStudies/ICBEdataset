CRISNO 368

ATTEMPTED COUP IN TOGO

Background:

Togo experienced a crisis with Ghana from 23 September 1986 to 5 February 1987.

Background As part of the "scramble for Africa" among Europe's great powers, Togoland became a German protectorate in 1884. During World War I an Anglo-French agreement (1916) over the "spoils of war" divided Togoland, with the French part, Togo, attached to French West Africa. It became a UN Trust Territory in 1946, with France as the Trusteeship power. After a UN plebiscite it became an autonomous republic in 1956. Along with the rest of France's empire in Africa, Togo became independent, on 27 April 1960. Its first head of state, Sylvanus Olympio, was overthrown by an army coup in 1963. Nicholas Grunitzky, who succeeded him, was ousted in 1967 by another army coup led by the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Etienne Eyadema, who remained in power for more than two decades. Since 1963 French military intervention was permitted under the terms of a France-Togo defense agreement.

Summary:

A crisis for Togo was triggered by another attempted military coup, on 23 September 1986. The rebels' objective was to seize the radio station and the military barracks which also served as the president's residence and the headquarters of the governing party, the RPT (Rassemblement du Peuple Togolais). Togo accused Ghana of supporting the coup. Fourteen persons were killed in clashes with security forces in the capital, Lomé. Many of the 60 rebels were captured during that sole outbreak of violence.

Togo managed its crisis with Ghana by non-violent means. On the 24th a curfew was imposed, the Lomé international airport was closed, and Togo's borders with Ghana and Benin were closed. The next day Eyadema requested French military assistance in accordance with the 1963 defense agreement. France responded on the 26th, dispatching 150 paratroops and jet aircraft. The same day Zaire, too, sent troops to support Eyadema. On the 28th President Mobutu of Zaire visited Togo, as did representatives from Ivory Coast, Benin, Niger, Morocco, and Liberia in a show of support. On the 29th Togo again accused Ghana--and Burkina Faso--of training the rebels; both denied any involvement. In October and November about 300 Ghanaians were charged with illegal entry into Togo and were deported.

During an OAU fact-finding mission Secretary-General Oumarou discussed the crisis with leaders of both countries. The mission reported on 26 November without supporting or rejecting Togo's charges. By then the crisis was winding down, though it lingered for another two months. Burkina Faso sent a delegation to Lomé on 13 January 1987 for the celebration of Eyadema's 20 years in power. Togo reopened its border with Ghana on 2 February. And on the 5th Togo, in an official announcement, absolved Ghana of any involvement in the attempted coup. This ended the crisis.

The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.

(In March, Togo's foreign minister called for a restoration of normal relations.)
