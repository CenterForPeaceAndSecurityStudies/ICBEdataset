CRISNO 160

IFNI

Background:

Spain's crisis in North Africa began on 23 November 1957 and ended in April 1958.

Background Ifni, a small Spanish enclave in southern Morocco on the Atlantic coast, was ceded to Spain in 1869 and occupied in 1934. In 1956, when Morocco became independent, Spain ceded to the new kingdom the part known as Spanish Morocco on the Mediterranean coast but retained Spanish West Africa and the tiny enclave of Ifni. For several months prior to this crisis, armed bands of the Army for the Liberation of Sahara (AOL) had crossed into Ifni to harass Spanish forces. The AOL was also active in aiding Algeria in its struggle for independence from France (1954-62). Spain requested Morocco to impose its authority on the armed bands and replace them with units of the regular Moroccan army. Since no response was received, Spain decided to reinforce its garrison in Ifni.

Summary:

On 23 November 1957 large-scale fighting broke out between Spanish troops stationed in Ifni and 1,200 Moroccan irregulars, following an attack by the AOL.

Spain's major response to a threat to its territory occurred the next day--heavy bombing of the invading forces. Moroccan government troops were sent to take up positions around Ifni. Several of the AOL camps were dismantled. Spain then threatened to carry the fighting into Agadir, a Moroccan town north of Ifni. Negotiations among several militant Saharan groups and King Mohammed V of Morocco, in the spring of 1958, enabled the king to solidify his authority and permitted Morocco to exercise a restraining influence over guerrilla operations. Spain ceded the Tekna protectorate and Tarfaya to Morocco in April, perhaps as a result of U.S. mediation, terminating the Ifni crisis.

The UN and the USSR were not active in this crisis.

(In January 1969 Spain ceded Ifni to Morocco.)
