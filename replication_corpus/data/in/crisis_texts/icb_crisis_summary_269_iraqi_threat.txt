CRISNO 269

IRAQI THREAT

Background:

An Iraqi troop concentration on its border with Syria caused a crisis for Syria from 9 to 17 June 1976.

Background and Pre-crisis Events in the Middle East in 1976 were complex. A civil war was raging in Lebanon, with Syrian military participation in an attempt to avert a partition of Lebanon (see Case #265--Lebanon Civil War I). Syria's 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Israel (see Case #255--October-Yom Kippur War, in 1973, in Arab/Israel PC) had facilitated an uneasy truce between the two enemies, with Syria maintaining a division on its border in the Golan Heights. Iraq's relations with the rival Ba'ath regime in Syria were visibly tense. In addition, disputes between Iraq and Syria's ally, Iran, over the Shatt-al-Arab had never been solved (see Cases #172, #234, in 1959-60, 1969, in Iran/Iraq PC). In June 1976 Syria's preoccupation with events in Lebanon afforded Iraq an opportunity to attempt to weaken President Asad's regime.

Summary:

On 9 June 1976, in a sudden and surprise act, Iraq moved troops to its border with Syria, triggering a crisis for the latter. Part of Syria's army was engaged in the civil war in Lebanon, with much of its forces protecting Syria's border with Israel. A tacit agreement with Israel was sought to allow Syria to transfer troops from the Golan Heights. When this was achieved Syria responded on 13 June by removing its division from the Golan Heights and placing it on the Iraqi border. On 17 June the crisis ended when President Asad signaled the decline of threat perception by leaving the country for a three-day visit to France. Soon after the forces of both Iraq and Syria withdrew from the border to their original positions.

Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN or the Arab League, was involved in this crisis.
