CRISNO 413

ECUADOR-PERU V

Background:

The most recent crisis between Ecuador and Peru over their disputed border occurred from 9 January to 28 February 1995.

Background

In January 1995, violence erupted once more over an undemarcated 78 km stretch of the Ecuador/Peru border that is reputed to contain gold, uranium and, possibly, oil deposits.

Summary:

Armed clashes between Ecuador and Peru began on 9 January 1995, although it is unclear as to which side fired first. Fighting intensified on 26 January. The next day, Ecuadorean President Sixto Durin Ballen proclaimed a state of emergency. Both armies called up reserves; and Peru's President Alberto Fujimori reportedly began to personally direct the military operation. The fighting was escalated further between 27 and 29 January. On the 29th President Durin claimed that Peru had opened a massive attack on four Ecuadorean bases, and an Ecuadorian communiqu√© claimed that a Peruvian helicopter had been shot down.

On 31 January officials from the two states jointly announced a cease-fire, following talks in Rio de Janeiro that were mediated by the guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol - the US, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. On 3 February negotiators for Peru and Ecuador reached an accord, to be submitted to their respective governments. However, fighting resumed in early February and seriously escalated on the 10th, when Peru launched heavy air attacks on Ecuadorean positions along the Cenepa river. Three Peruvian aircraft were shot down during the attacks. The US and Brazil announced that they were suspending all arms shipments to the two adversaries.

On 17 February the deputy foreign ministers of Peru (Eduardo Ponce Vivanco) and Ecuador (Marcelo Fernandez Cordoba) and representatives of the Rio Protocol guarantors signed a peace declaration at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia. Ecuador and Peru accepted the guarantor countries' offer to send observers to monitor the cease-fire, to separate the confronting forces immediately, to begin a "gradual and mutual demobilization" and to begin talks to resolve the dispute. The observation mission of the guarantor states began operations on 21 February. However, fighting resumed the next day and Ecuador accused Peru of using chemical weapons and flame throwers. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Peru (Efraim Goldenberg Schreiber) and the Ecuadorean Foreign Minister (Galo Leoro Franco) met with the guarantor mediators on 28 February in Montevideo, Uruguay. The next day a cease-fire took effect; the parties reiterated their commitment to the Itamaraty peace declaration and accepted the "immediate presence of observers" from the Rio guarantors to supervise the cease-fire. That agreement, on 1 March 1995, terminated this international crisis but did not yet resolve the territorial dispute. A permanent observer mission replaced the temporary mission on 30 March.

The UN was not involved in the crisis.

(Several other violent incidents were reported in mid-March, and on the 22nd 28th. On 26 April Peru announced that it had complied fully with the timetable for the separation of forces in the border zone. Ecuador declared its withdrawal from the disputed area the following day.)
