CRISNO 122

SOVIET NOTE TO FINLAND I

Background:

Finland was in a state of crisis with the USSR from 22 February until 6 April 1948.

Pre-crisis On 9 February 1948 there was a meeting of representatives of the Nordic states. The Soviet Union felt that Nordic cooperation, backed by the West and, specifically, by the United States, posed a threat to Soviet hegemony in northern Europe.

Summary:

On 22 February the Soviet Union sent a Note to the Finnish government requesting a meeting of high-level officials for the purpose of concluding a Treaty of Mutual Friendship, Cooperation, and Non-Aggression. Such a treaty would effectively prevent Finland from adopting a pro-Western stance. Finland responded on 8 March 1948 by sending a delegation to Moscow.

The crisis ended on 6 April 1948 with the signing of a treaty. There was no violence and no overt threats by the Soviet Union. The negotiations seemed to proceed smoothly, and all parties appeared satisfied with the outcome. However, a message from Stalin was construed as containing an implied threat of Soviet military action if Finland did not comply with Moscow's proposal. The crisis was a turning point in Finnish/Soviet relations: it led to a basic change in Finland's foreign policy orientation and created the phenomenon of "Finlandization," namely, curtailing the freedom of action in international relations of a formally sovereign state in the emerging global cold war. The U.S. and the UN were not involved.
