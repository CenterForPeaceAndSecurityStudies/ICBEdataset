CRISNO 272

AEGEAN SEA I

Background:

Greece and Turkey experienced a crisis over disputed rights to Aegean Sea resources from 6 August to 25 September 1976.

Background and Pre-crisis Greece had long claimed an exclusive right to the continental shelf off each of its Aegean islands. Turkey disputed the claim. Their protracted conflict flared up again on 15 July 1976, when Turkey's prime minister announced that a Turkish "research vessel," the Sizmik I, would prospect for oil in the Aegean Sea before the end of the month. On the 19th Greece threatened military retaliation if Turkey violated its jurisdiction in the Aegean. And on the 29th Greece dispatched several warships to patrol the area.

Summary:

The Sizmik I sailed from Canakkale on 6 August, accompanied by a Turkish minesweeper and military aircraft. This triggered a crisis for Greece, which filed a complaint with Turkey immediately. On the 12th Athens declared a state of alert for all Greek troops along the border with Turkey. Almost all of the Greek air force was moved to advanced bases. And the Greek navy began patrolling the eastern Aegean, where the Turkish vessel continued to take seismic soundings. Greece also complained to the UN Security Council and appealed to the International Court of Justice.

The Greek military response of 12 August triggered a crisis for Turkey. Both parties entered into negotiations under U.S. auspices. The Security Council passed a resolution urging negotiations and providing a framework for crisis resolution. The U.S. and the Soviet Union also encouraged the parties to negotiate. In September the Turkish navy announced that its "research ship" would cease operations in the Aegean. On 25 September it returned to Turkish waters, terminating the first of three crises on this aspect of the Greece/Turkey conflict (see Cases #349 and #376).
