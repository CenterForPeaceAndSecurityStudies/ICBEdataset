CRISNO 174

GHANA-TOGO BORDER I

Background:

A crisis for Ghana lasted from early March to 1 April 1960.

Background and Pre-crisis In 1956 a majority of voters in a plebiscite held in the Trust Territory of British Togoland voted to accede to Ghana instead of to the adjoining area under French jurisdiction. Counterdemands were made for the reunification of the two Togos and the creation of a Togolese state within its pre-1914 German colonial frontiers. In October 1958 the announcement by France that Togo would receive its independence in April 1960 revived the dispute. In October 1959 and again in January 1960 Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana called for the integration of the two countries after Togo's independence. The future President of Togo, Sylvanus Olympio, rejected the idea of a merger with Ghana.

Summary:

A crisis for Ghana was triggered in early March 1960 when a draft constitution for the Republic of Togo was uncovered by Ghanaian government agents. It laid claim to the territory of the formerly British Togoland, which had been incorporated into Ghana as the Volta region. Furthermore, a plot by irregular forces, inhabitants of the Volta region trained in Togo, to infiltrate and attack Ghana in the last week of March was uncovered. After France ignored a formal Ghanaian protest requesting that it take immediate action to prevent the territory under its administration from serving as a base for an armed attack against Ghana, Nkrumah convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet. Cabinet members were asked to approve the following decisions taken by an ad hoc committee on 14 March: to strengthen security forces in the Volta region; to arrest opposition leaders and those involved in the plot; and to issue a public statement. Annual army exercises were carried out in the Volta region between 22 and 28 March, and an additional army battalion was sent to the region in April.

After the date of the expected invasion passed without incident the tension began to subside. The termination date was 1 April when a decision was made to send top-level Ghanaian delegates to Togo's independence celebrations. (Subsequent to the crisis, a meeting between Nkrumah and Olympio was held on 12 June 1960 where agreement was reached on a union for economic and political cooperation.)

Neither the U.S. or the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
