CRISNO 142

TRIESTE II

Background:

There were two crisis actors in the second international crisis over Trieste--Yugoslavia and Italy. It began on 8 October and ended on 5 December 1953.

Summary:

On 8 October 1953 Britain and the United States announced their intention to terminate the Allied Military Government in Trieste, to withdraw their troops, and to relinquish the administration to the Italian government. This triggered a crisis for Yugoslavia, which responded two days later by lodging a formal protest with London and Washington and informing the UN. The frontier was closed, Yugoslav military reserves were called up, and warships were moved into the area. Those acts on the 10th triggered Italy's crisis. Italy's major response, on 17 October, was to place three divisions at the Yugoslav frontier on emergency posting.

The decision by the U.K. and U.S. to evacuate Trieste was postponed while diplomatic efforts continued to convene a conference. On 5 December 1953 an agreement was announced in Rome and Belgrade for the simultaneous withdrawal of Italian and Yugoslav forces from the border. This ended the crisis for both actors.

During the crisis, delegations from the US and UK attempted to mediate between the Yugoslav and Italian antagonists. They used various styles of mediation, which included meeting with each side separately and then trying to reach a mutually acceptable compromise based on those meetings. Ultimately, the mediation strongly contributed to bringing about a resolution to the conflict.

(The political outcome of the dispute took the form of a Memorandum of Understanding, signed on 5 October 1954 by the U.S., the U.K., Italy, and Yugoslavia, which granted the northern zone to Italy and the southern zone to Yugoslavia.)
