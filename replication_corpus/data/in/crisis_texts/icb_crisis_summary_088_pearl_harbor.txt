CRISNO 88

PEARL HARBOR

Background:

The Japanese attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor crystallized a crisis for Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Thailand, Germany, and Italy. The duration of the crisis was from 26 November 1941 until 7 June 1942.

Background and Pre-crisis Japan's quest for empire was symbolized by the proclamation of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It began with the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 (see Case #39--Mukden Incident, in China/Japan PC). During the 1930s the Imperial Army spread southward into China (see Cases #40--Shanghai, in 1932; #43--Jehol Campaign, in 1933; #56--Marco Polo Bridge, in 1937-38; all in China/Japan PC). Later its attention shifted to the Western colonial empires in Southeast Asia (British Malaya, Dutch Indonesia, French Indochina). These countries could supply Japan's need for raw materials so as to reduce its dependence on other countries, notably the U.S., for such strategic commodities as petroleum, rubber, and iron.

In 1941 both the U.S. and the U.K. stood in the way of complete Japanese control of the Far East and Southeast Asia. The U.S. had vested interests in the region since the early part of the century, and its army and navy occupied important bases around Manila Bay in the Philippines. The U.S. considered the Philippines a vital link in the defense line for the protection of the west coast and continental United States. The British had long controlled Malaya and Borneo, with Singapore serving as one of the most important U.K. bases for imperial defense.

The fall of France in 1940 (see Case #78--Fall of Western Europe) had removed one of Japan's obstacles; and by 1941 the Konoye government had worked out an arrangement with Vichy France for the use of French Indochina as a military corridor and base. The Dutch government and royal family fled to London with the fall of the Netherlands on 12 May 1940. However, its government-in-exile, together with the Dutch East Indies government (headed by the governor-general), continued to run the affairs of Indonesia, which was rich in oil and rubber.

During 1940 the United States exerted economic pressure on Japan. On 25 July the President prohibited the export of U.S. petroleum, petroleum products, and scrap metal without license. A few days later an embargo was imposed on the export of aviation fuel to all countries outside the Western Hemisphere except for use by U.S. planes. The embargo was expanded to scrap iron and steel after the signing of the Germany-Italy-Japan Tripartite Pact on 26 September 1940. After Japan landed troops in French Indochina on 24 July 1941, talks between Japan and the United States were broken off and all Japanese assets in the United States were frozen, effectively cutting Japan off from its most important markets and sources of raw materials.

In August Prime Minister Konoye sought a meeting with President Roosevelt but was rebuffed. Later that month, at a joint army-navy meeting, the heads of the Japanese armed forces agreed in principle that, if diplomacy did not bring results by mid-October 1941, the use of force against the U.S. would be unavoidable; and they subsequently stated that the decision for war or peace must be made by 15 October. Between 25 September and 15 October Konoye was unsuccessful in gaining political control over the supreme command of the armed forces. The cabinet resigned on 16 October, and Konoye was replaced, on the 18th, by General Tojo, who retained the position of War Minister.

To the United States' surprise, Tojo decided to continue the diplomatic path and sent a second envoy, Kurusu, to Washington to help the resident ambassador, Nomura, in his efforts to reach an agreement. Meanwhile, secret plans for the military campaign against the United States continued. During the first two weeks of November the Japanese embassy in Washington received a steady stream of messages that would eventually make up two Japanese proposals, A and B. These messages were deciphered by U.S. naval intelligence, thus informing the U.S. of a new Japanese deadline of 25 November for U.S. acceptance of its final proposal. (The deadline, the U.S. discovered, was postponed to 29 November.) Japan's proposals were rejected by Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

Summary:

On 26 November 1941 Hull presented the two Japanese envoys with a Ten Point Plan, viewed by Japan as an ultimatum and triggering a crisis for Tokyo. At the same time that Nomura and Kurusu were talking with Hull, Admiral Nagumo's task force had been at sea for 24 hours en route to Pearl Harbor. However, it was still in Tojo's power to stop them. On 1 December Japan's major response was a decision for war, but negotiations with the United States continued until 7 December.

The attack on Pearl Harbor, on 7 December 1941, triggered a crisis for the United States as well as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the U.K. The Americans suffered 2,400 deaths and over 1,000 wounded. The U.S. responded on 8 December with a declaration of war. The British responded to the attack on a friendly state, as well as to the attack on Malaya the same day, by declaring war on Japan. Canada did likewise on the 8th. The Netherlands' response, on 8 December, was to mobilize the army in the Netherlands East Indies and to declare a state of emergency.

The trigger to Thailand's crisis was a Japanese attack on its territory on 8 December. After only five hours of fighting, the Thai government surrendered and announced that it would allow Japanese forces to pass through its territory. Japan, it was contended, would respect Thailand's territorial integrity. On 8 December, too, when the United States and its allies declared war on Japan, a crisis was triggered for Italy and Germany. The following day Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis with similar declarations of war. On 10 December Thailand announced that it would not fight together with the Allied forces, thereby ending its crisis. And on 11 December Italy and Germany declared war on the United States. On the 21st a 10-year alliance was signed at Bangkok between Japan and Thailand: the Thai government agreed to aid Japan and declared war on the U.S. and the U.K. on 25 January 1942.

On 25 December 1941 British and Canadian forces in Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese. From 27 January to 1 March the Battle of the Java Sea took place: Allied naval units were largely destroyed, and the way was opened for the Japanese conquest of the East Indies. The end of the crisis for the Netherlands was its formal surrender on 5 March 1942. Singapore fell on 15 February 1942 when the Japanese, having penetrated Malaya, landed from the north. Sixty thousand prisoners were taken. The fall of Singapore, signaling apparent victory for Japan, terminated its crisis and the crisis for its Axis allies, Germany and Italy. The British surrender terminated the U.K. crisis, in defeat.

In March the British evacuated Rangoon, allowing Japan to occupy Burma; the Burma Road was subsequently closed. The Battle of the Coral Sea began on 7 May. Allied naval and air power frustrated a possible Japanese invasion of Australia by destroying 100,000 tons of Japanese shipping between New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. On 8 May, with the reduction of danger, the crisis ended for Australia and New Zealand. And on 4 June a Japanese naval force attacked Midway Island and was dispersed, with heavy losses, by U.S. air and naval units. The crisis for Canada and the United States ended on 7 June 1942.

The United States approached the Pan American Union on 10 December 1941, but no activity followed.
