CRISNO 228

ESSEQUIBO I

Background:

A crisis for Guyana, in a long-standing territorial dispute with Venezuela, occurred from 9 July to sometime in August 1968.

Background British Guiana (since 1966, Guyana) and Venezuela have long disputed a large tract of territory contiguous to the Essequibo River. In 1899 an arbitral tribunal awarded the bulk of the territory, 45,000 of 53,000 square miles, to British Guiana. Venezuela accepted the award in 1905--until 1962 when, at the UN General Assembly, it pressed for a revision of the boundary. Venezuela claimed the entire disputed territory, which comprised 62 percent of British Guiana's total land base. Venezuela recognized Guiana's independence in 1966 and participated with British Guiana and the U.K. in a tripartite commission to resolve the dispute within four years.

Summary:

On 9 July 1968 Dr. Raul Leoni, President of Venezuela, issued a decree that annexed to Venezuela the territorial waters lying from three to 12 miles along the coast of the Guyana Essequibo. Venezuelan naval craft were later reported patrolling outside the three-mile limit. Guyana's response was a protest note to Venezuela, a complaint to UN Secretary-General U Thant, protests to Latin American members of the United Nations, and a complaint by Guyana's foreign minister to President Johnson. It was reported that, although the U.S. wanted to maintain a neutral position in the dispute, it did appeal to Venezuela to revoke the decree. Guyana declared Venezuela's decree to be null and void and announced that it would resist an invasion by Venezuela. The crisis faded in August 1968.

UN Secretary-General U Thant served as a facilitative mediator through the use of his good offices, which provided a forum for the crisis actors to negotiate. However, it appears that U Thantâ€™s efforts were generally ineffective in hastening crisis abatement.. Barbados expressed concern about Venezuela's contemplated use of force in a Note from its prime minister to the foreign minister of Venezuela.

(There were minor military incidents in the disputed territory in 1969 and 1970--until Guyana, Venezuela, and the U.K. formally agreed in the Trinidad Protocol on 18 June 1970 to a 12-year "cooling-off period" on the border dispute [see Case #325--Essequibo II].)
