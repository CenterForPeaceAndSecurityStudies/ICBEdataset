CRISNO 336

FALKLANDS/MALVINAS

Background:

The U.K. and Argentina were enmeshed in an increasingly violent interstate crisis over the Falklands/Malvinas Islands from 31 March until 14 June 1982.

Background The thinly populated island archipelago south of Argentina (2,100 in 1995) was discovered in 1592 by John Davis, a British explorer, and came under British, French, and Spanish control. Spain, the hegemonial power in Latin America until the nineteenth century, bought out the French in 1770 and drove out the British in 1774. It held sway in the islands until 1811. Argentina asserted sovereignty over the islands soon after attaining its independence from Spain in 1816. However, the U.K. ousted Argentina in 1833 and has retained control over the Falklands, along with nearby South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, ever since.

Argentina never recognized U.K. sovereignty over the Malvinas and frequently challenged it: in 1927, 1946, 1948, and 1953, and in 1973, when it submitted a claim before the UN, all to no avail. Negotiations between Argentina and the U.K. since 1966, at UN initiative, led to stalemate.

Pre-crisis On 1 March 1982 Argentina's foreign minister warned that, if an agreement on the islands were not reached shortly, Argentina would resort to "other means" to resolve the dispute. Two days later London expressed "deep anxiety" over this statement. On the 19th a group of 60 Argentine civilians raised the Argentine flag in South Georgia. Moreover, Buenos Aires rejected London's request to punish the transgressors and sent a ship with supplies to secure their well-being. On the 28th Argentina's foreign minister termed the situation "grave." And on the 30th British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington responded that it was "potentially dangerous." The same day the president of the UN Security Council, which met at the U.K.'s request because it feared an imminent Argentine invasion of the islands, called on both parties to seek a diplomatic solution.

Summary:

The trigger to a crisis for the U.K. was a British intelligence report on 31 March that an Argentine invasion of the Falklands was imminent. Prime Minister Thatcher cabled President Reagan the same day seeking his personal intervention with President Galtieri, to no avail. The U.K. leaders decided on 1 April to send a task force to the South Atlantic, recognizing that it would take 26 days to reach the Falklands.

On 2 April Argentine troops took control of the islands after less than four hours of combat. UN Security Council Resolution 502, on 3 April, condemned the Argentine invasion and called for its immediate withdrawal. The same day Britain's prime minister announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Buenos Aires and pledged before parliament her determination to regain control of the islands.

The U.K.'s dispatch of a large naval task force to the South Atlantic on 5 April triggered a crisis for Argentina: its leaders did not expect a British military riposte to their invasion of the islands. The next day London imposed economic sanctions on Argentina--the U.K. was its major investor and trading partner. The European Community (EC) approved the sanctions on the 10th. Argentina responded three days later with economic sanctions on all EC products. The European parliament condemned the Argentine invasion on 22 April.

Argentina mobilized 100,000 reservists on 9 April. The OAS, meeting on 22 April at Argentina's request, did not condemn U.K. behavior. Three days later British forces regained control of South Georgia. Argentina proclaimed a technical state of war the same day and informed the Security Council.

On 26 April the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against Argentina. On the 28th, in a marked shift, the OAS adopted a resolution recognizing Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas and calling upon the U.K. to withdraw its forces. Full-scale war erupted from the moment the British naval task force reached the Falklands. Argentina's foreign minister accepted the idea of U.S. mediation on 6 May. On the 21st 5,000 British troops landed on East Falkland Island. On the 25th the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 505 requesting Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar to renew an offer of good offices in an attempt to resolve the conflict. The OAS adopted a resolution on 29 May condemning the U.K. On 3 June British marines began their attack on the main Argentine garrison at Port Stanley. Argentine troops surrendered on 14 June terminating the crisis for both Argentina and the U.K. The outcome was unqualified victory for the U.K. and humiliating defeat for Argentina. There were almost 1,000 casualties in the war over the Falklands/Malvinas, 250 British, 700 on the Argentine side.

As noted, the U.S. played a conspicuous role. It attempted to prevent the Argentine invasion. Then, through the efforts of Secretary of State Haig, Washington tried to mediate an accommodation between the parties. From 8-21 April, Haig shuttled back and forth between London and Buenos Aires, delivering messages, helping formulate proposals and actively pressuring Argentina. And when these efforts failed after Argentina rejected Haigâ€™s request to continue mediation on 27 April, the U.S. declared its support for U.K. rights in the Falklands. The USSR adopted a passive posture, though it supported Argentina's aspirations, verbally. As noted, too, the UN and the OAS passed resolutions condemning one or the other party and sought to resolve the crisis by mediation, without success.

(Diplomatic relations between Argentina and the U.K. were restored in 1992. And in mid-September 1995 they reached agreement over their disputed claims to large natural gas and oil resources in the vicinity of the islands, reportedly, two-thirds of the earnings to the U.K., one-third to Argentina. The dispute over territory remains unresolved.)
