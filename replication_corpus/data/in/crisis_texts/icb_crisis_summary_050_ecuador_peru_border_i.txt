CRISNO 50

ECUADOR-PERU BORDER I

Background:

The first crisis between Peru and Ecuador over the territory of the Marañón River basin lasted from 1 to 30 November 1935.

Summary:

On 1 November 1935 Ecuadorian cavalry and police invaded the Peruvian province of Tumbes. The following day Peru delivered a protest note to Ecuador. The Peruvian Congress met in secret session on 13 November. Peru's major response, on the 14th, was to send strong reinforcements, including infantry and planes, to its garrison in Tumbes. This triggered a crisis for Ecuador. Further protests were sent by Peru to Ecuador. The crisis terminated on 30 November when the Peruvian foreign minister announced that Ecuador had been invited to submit the question of the disputed territory to arbitration. Ecuador agreed. There was no League of Nations, OAS, or U.S. involvement in this crisis.
