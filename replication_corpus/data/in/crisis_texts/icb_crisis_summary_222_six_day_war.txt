CRISNO 222

SIX DAY WAR

Background:

The six actors in this Middle East crisis were Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the United States, Syria, and the Soviet Union. It began on 17 May and ended on 11 June 1967.

Background and Pre-crisis Tension along the Israel/Syria border had been increasing since the autumn of 1966 due to the stepping up of attacks by Palestinian guerrillas based in Syria. On 7 April 1967 six Syrian MIG fighter planes were downed in an air battle over the Israel/Syria border. Israel repeatedly warned Syria that a massive reprisal would be inevitable if Damascus did not stop active support of Palestinian raids into Israel. On 14 May both Syria and Egypt announced a state of emergency based upon Soviet-inspired reports that Israel was concentrating troops on its northern border.

Summary:

Two hostile acts by Egypt on 17 May 1967 triggered a crisis for Israel: an overflight of Israel's nuclear research center at Dimona and the dispatch of two additional Egyptian divisions into Sinai (others had crossed the Canal in the preceding two days). On the 18th UN Secretary-General U Thant acceded to President Nasir's demand, two days earlier, to withdraw the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) from Sinai. (It had functioned since the 1956 Suez War [see Case #152].) Army reserves were mobilized in Israel and Egypt on the 19th and 21st. And on 23 May Egypt announced the closure of the Strait of Tiran, thus blockading the Israeli port of Eilat. The British and U.S. governments termed this act a violation of international law, while the Soviet Union blamed Israel for the dangerous situation in the Middle East. Efforts by the U.S. and the U.K. to form a naval flotilla failed. The U.S. Sixth Fleet moved toward the eastern Mediterranean. The Security Council met at the request of Canada and Denmark. On 30 May a Defense Pact was signed between Jordan and Egypt.

Israel's major response to its crisis was a decision on 4 June to launch a preemptive strike. This was implemented by an air attack on Egypt's air force bases on 5 June, destroying Egyptian air power and triggering a crisis for Jordan and Egypt. Despite an Israeli assurance to Jordan via the United Nations that, if Jordan kept out of the war, Israel would not initiate any military action against its eastern neighbor, Jordan responded the same day by opening fire on Jerusalem and bombing Netanya. Israel destroyed the small Jordanian air force and, by noon of 7 June, captured the Jordan-controlled Old City of Jerusalem. Egypt's response, on 5 June, was to launch a counterattack against Israel.

The crisis trigger for the United States was a message from Premier Kosygin on 6 June threatening Soviet intervention. The crises for Syria and the Soviet Union were triggered on the 9th by Israeli advances on the Golan Heights. Syria responded immediately by bombarding Israeli border settlements. The next day the Soviets responded with a "hot line" telephone call from Kosygin to Johnson threatening Soviet action unless Israel halted operations at once. The major U.S. response was an immediate order by President Johnson to change the course of the Sixth Fleet and to cut the 100-mile restriction from the Syrian coast to 50 miles, signaling that the U.S. was prepared to resist Soviet intervention in the Arab/Israel war. Syria accepted a cease-fire on 10 June. The following day the cease-fire came into effect for all the other actors, terminating the 1967 Middle East Crisis.

Five East European states, together with the Soviet Union, severed diplomatic relations with Israel, namely, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. The UN helped to escalate the crisis, by the removal of UNEF, but it also contributed to the more rapid termination of the crisis through the efforts of the Security Council and cease-fire resolutions. The political activity of the two superpowers, especially that of the U.S., had an important impact on the course of the crisis and its outcome.
