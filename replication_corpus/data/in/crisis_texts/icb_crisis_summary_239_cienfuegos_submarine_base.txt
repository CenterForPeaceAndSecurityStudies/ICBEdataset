CRISNO 239

CIENFUEGOS SUBMARINE BASE

Background:

This Cold War crisis for the United States occurred from 16 September to 23 October 1970.

Background and Pre-crisis U-2 intelligence flights over Cuba had been conducted by the U.S. since the Missile crisis of 1962 (see Case #196). In 1968 a Soviet naval squadron visited Cienfuegos in Cuba. On 2 and 9 September 1970 two more Soviet naval visits took place. The Soviet Ambassador in Washington, Dobrynin, met with National Security Advisor Kissinger in August to determine U.S. intentions in light of the 1962 agreement on Cuba. In September U-2 planes picked up the first information on Soviet construction of a nuclear submarine base at Cienfuegos.

Summary:

Kissinger informed President Nixon on 16 September 1970 that U.S. intelligence flights had substantiated reports about construction of the Soviet base, the trigger for a U.S. crisis. Nixon warned Foreign Minister Gromyko that the U.S. was monitoring events carefully. On 25 September the story broke in the U.S. press. The U.S. major response, that day, was a warning from Kissinger to Dobrynin and a demand for an explanation. Dobrynin's answer, on the 27th, was that there had not been a violation of the 1962 agreement since no offensive weapons had been installed at Cienfuegos. At another meeting with Kissinger on 5 October, Dobrynin reaffirmed the validity of the 1962 agreement. Kissinger asked for a definition of a "base." On 13 October a Tass news agency communiqu√© denied that the Soviet Union was building a base in Cuba. Reports in the U.S. confirmed that a submarine tender had left Cienfuegos. On 22 October Gromyko, at a meeting with Nixon, reaffirmed the 1962 agreement once again. U-2 photos revealed a slowdown, and later a halt, in construction. On 23 October the U.S. crisis ended when Washington received a Soviet assurance that construction had been halted and that the Soviet naval force had left Cienfuegos.

The UN remained aloof during this crisis.

(The dispute continued until the spring of 1971, but tension decreased substantially, and the docking of Soviet submarines at other Cuban harbors was not perceived as a military threat to the United States.)
