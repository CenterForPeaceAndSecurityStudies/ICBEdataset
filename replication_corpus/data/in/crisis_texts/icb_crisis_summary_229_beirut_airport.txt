CRISNO 229

BEIRUT AIRPORT

Background:

A crisis for Lebanon began on 28 December 1968. The crisis ended sometime in January 1969.

Pre-crisis On 26 December 1968 the Lebanon-based PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) attacked an Israeli civilian plane at Athens International Airport. One passenger was killed. Israel's policy had long been to retaliate against the host country in the hope of compelling the Arab states to restrain Palestinian attacks on Israeli citizens and property.

Summary:

The crisis trigger for Lebanon was Israel's retaliation raid on Beirut International Airport on 28 December 1968, destroying 13 jetliners belonging to the Middle East Airlines and other Lebanese-owned planes. There was no loss of life. The Lebanese security forces did not intervene. Lebanon's major response, the following day, was a complaint against Israel to the Security Council. Two days later Lebanon declared a state of alert and mobilized reserve forces. The raid on Beirut accentuated Lebanon's civil tensions and triggered an internal political crisis in that country. The international crisis ended some time in January 1969.

There was widespread condemnation of the Israeli raid, including a protest by the Vatican. On 7 January 1969 France reiterated its policy of a total embargo on all military supplies destined for Israel. The U.S. offered aid to Lebanon and put its Sixth Fleet on low-level alert. The Soviet Union confined its political activity to statements at the United Nations. The Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel.
