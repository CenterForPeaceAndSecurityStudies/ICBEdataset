CRISNO 170

CENTRAL AMERICA-CUBA I

Background:

This crisis involved four actors: Panama, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. It began on 25 April 1959 and ended toward the close of 1959.

Pre-crisis The Batista dictatorship in Cuba collapsed on 1 January 1959 when Fidel Castro established control. The new Cuban government welcomed exiles from Latin American countries and aided them in organizing revolutionary activities. All four actor-cases derived from invasions in which exiles and the Cuban armed forces tried to establish a revolutionary government in each of the four states previously noted. In all, a grave economic situation existed, and domestic unrest was prevalent.

Summary:

The first to experience a crisis was Panama, where a boat carrying 80-90 foreign invaders landed on 25 April 1959. Panama responded the following day by requesting assistance from the OAS, which agreed to supply arms, as well as to send an inquiry committee. Castro, recognizing OAS disapproval, denounced the invaders on 28 April and sent two government officials to persuade the invaders to surrender. They did so on 1 May. The following day an OAS international naval patrol off the Panama coast was authorized. The crisis terminated for Panama on 4 May 1959 when the naval and aerial patrols were called off and the OAS investigating committee returned to Washington.

On 1 June a small force of Nicaraguan exiles from Costa Rica landed in two areas of Nicaragua. An emergency session of the OAS was held on 2 June, and a fact-finding mission was sent two days later to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. President Somoza accepted the Costa Rican expression of neutrality and did not view the latter as the source of threat to Nicaragua. On 11 June the rebellion was crushed as a result of a swift military response by Nicaragua. On 13 June Somoza accused Castro of personally preparing the master plan for the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. The crisis ended on 14 June 1959 when a victory parade was held in Nicaragua.

The third in this series of low-intensity crises was an invasion of the Dominican Republic on 14 June 1959, which met with military resistance. The economic situation in the Dominican Republic was particularly grave, with mounting terror and government repression. On 24 June Trujillo declared that the invasion, assisted by the Cuban navy, had been repelled. A complaint was lodged against Cuba at the OAS on 2 July, but because of an unfavorable OAS attitude toward the Trujillo regime, the Dominican Republic did not request an emergency session. Tension remained high for several more months and dissolved slowly at the end of 1959.

Haiti was invaded on 13 August 1959, during a period of extreme instability and terror. The response occurred on the 16th with a Note to the OAS foreign ministers charging Cuba with responsibility. And on 5 September the Haiti government announced the surrender of the invaders.

The OAS was actively involved throughout this multiple crisis, assisting each state in its confrontation with the Cuban threat. Fact-finding missions were sent. Superpower involvement was relatively limited. The U.S. sought to maintain stability in the area by organizing a naval mission to patrol the Caribbean waters and authorizing it to shoot in order to bar any communist-led invasion attempt. The USSR was not involved in the crisis; but it made known its support of Castro's Cuban government.
