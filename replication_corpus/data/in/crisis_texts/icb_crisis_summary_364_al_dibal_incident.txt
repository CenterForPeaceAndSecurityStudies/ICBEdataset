CRISNO 364

AL-DIBAL INCIDENT

Background:

Bahrain experienced a crisis with Qatar over disputed territory from 26 April until 15 June 1986.

Background These two Persian Gulf ministates had been protectorates of the U.K., Bahrain from 1861, Qatar from 1916. Both were granted independence in 1971 as part of the last phase of Britain's retreat from empire in the Middle East.

Bahrain and Qatar had a long-standing dispute over the Hawar Islands adjacent to the Qatar Peninsula. There were periodic outbreaks of tension since the 1930s, but not a full-scale interstate crisis. In 1985 Bahrain began to construct a coast guard station on al-Dibal Island, within the disputed area.

Summary:

A crisis for Bahrain was triggered on 26 April 1986, when Qatari soldiers landed on al-Dibal, declared the island a "restricted zone," and arrested Bahraini officials. The raising of Qatar's flag on the 28th accentuated the perception of a threat to Bahrain's territorial integrity. On the 30th Bahrain denounced the occupation as "a violation of good-neighborliness."

The Netherlands, too, protested to Qatar because Qatari soldiers had seized a group of foreign workers employed by a Dutch construction company, Ballast Nedam Groep. Mediation by Oman, Sa'udi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Bahrain and Qatar, and Kuwait, led to an agreement: Qatari troops would withdraw from al-Dibal; and the tiny island would be evacuated by the Dutch construction company. All foreign workers were released on 12 May. And Qatari troops withdrew on 15 June, terminating the crisis.

There was no violence. The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the Arab League were not involved in this minicrisis between ministates.
