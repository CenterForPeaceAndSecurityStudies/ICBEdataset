CRISNO 125

CHINA CIVIL WAR

Background:

The international crisis resulting from the civil war in China involved Nationalist China and the United States as crisis actors from 23 September 1948 to 8 December 1949.

Summary:

On 23 September 1948 the strongly fortified city of Tsinan, Shantung's capital, fell to the Chinese Communists, triggering a crisis for the United States: the city was lost after the defection of an entire division of Nationalist soldiers. For the United States the Nationalist setback posed in increasingly acute form the threat of loss of U.S. influence in China and the question of granting large-scale military aid, including the eventual use of U.S. armed forces, to a government that had lost the confidence of its own troops and its own people. By the autumn of 1948 the whole of northeast China had fallen into Communist hands.

U.S. decision makers undertook an extensive policy review in October, and on the 26th the U.S. responded to the crisis with a decision not to commit military aid to Nationalist China, despite the near-certain consequences of Communist victory in the civil war. This decision ended the crisis for the United States.

Early in January 1949 Nationalist military strength was broken. Throughout that year the Communists gradually achieved control over the mainland. In the spring Nationalist forces began retreating to Taiwan.

The proclamation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949 expanded Nationalist China's internal crisis to international proportions. The response and termination occurred on the same date, 8 December 1949, when the Nationalists formally established the Republic of China (ROC) on the island of Taiwan, thereby tacitly acknowledging the PRC as ruler of mainland China. The United States backed Nationalist claims to be the sole representative of the people of China at the United Nations until 1971.

On 8 December 1949 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all states "to refrain from (a) seeking to acquire spheres of influence or to create foreign controlled regimes within the territory of China; (b) seeking to obtain special rights or privileges within the territory of China." This ended the crisis for China.

The Soviet involvement was political; substantial Soviet forces had been withdrawn from China by October 1948.

Three subsequent crises erupted over the Taiwan Strait and the larger issue of the unresolved China civil war, in 1954, 1958, and 1962 (see Cases #146, #166, and #192).
