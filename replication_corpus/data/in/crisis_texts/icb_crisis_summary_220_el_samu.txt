CRISNO 220

EL SAMU

Background:

The two actors in this crisis, a prelude to the Six Day War (see Case #222), were Israel and Jordan. It began on 12 November 1966 and ended on the 15th of that month.

Pre-crisis A series of border infiltrations and terrorist attacks on Israel emanating from Jordan took place from the summer of 1966 onward.

Summary:

On 12 November an Israel crisis was triggered when an army command car was blown up by a mine near the Jordanian border. Three soldiers were killed and six wounded. In an effort to deter Jordan from further aid to the Palestinian infiltrators, Israel responded the following day with a commando raid on the village of El Samu, in Jordan, where Palestinian supporters were concentrated. Jordan's response to the raid was mobilization of its army. Heavy fighting took place, and Israel withdrew a few hours later. Jordan appealed to the Security Council and issued an internal state of alert, especially against possible riots on the West Bank. Jordan ended the state of alert on the 15th, terminating the crisis for both countries.

The Secretary-General of the UN met with the ambassadors of both actors, but the UN did not resolve the crisis. The U.S. was politically involved in this crisis; the USSR was not.
