CRISNO 57

POSTAGE STAMP CRISIS

Background:

A postage stamp issued by Nicaragua, showing a map of its territory including a large part of southeastern Honduras, created a crisis for both states from mid-August to 10 December 1937.

Summary:

During the second week of August 1937 Nicaragua issued a postage stamp bearing a map of the Republic that included a considerable part of southeastern Honduras, marked as being "territory in dispute." This triggered a crisis for Honduras, which protested this "affront to her sovereignty" on the 25th. On 30 August Honduras responded with a concentration of forces along the Nicaraguan border. The likelihood of military hostilities triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. Its response, on 3 September, was a refusal to withdraw the stamp, declaring it to be the official map of Nicaragua.

Armed hostilities were prevented by the mediation of Costa Rica, Venezuela, and the United States. The three countries participated in a November conference in San Jose and were instrumental in resolving the crisis. On 10 December 1937 the two crisis actors signed a Pact of Reciprocal Agreement at San Jos√© in Costa Rica, terminating the crisis. (The conflict flared up again in 1957 [see Case #156].) This crisis was not brought to the League of Nations or the Pan American Union.
