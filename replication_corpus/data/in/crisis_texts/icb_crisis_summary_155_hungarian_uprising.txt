CRISNO 155

HUNGARIAN UPRISING

Background:

Hungary and the USSR were enmeshed in a crisis that began on 23 October 1956 and faded in January 1957.

Background Threats to USSR hegemony in Eastern Europe began to appear in the summer and fall of 1956. A crisis over Poland occurred in October (see Case #154--Poland Liberalization, in Poland/Russia PC). At that time Hungary was ruled by a Soviet-backed government headed by Communist leader Matyas Rakosi. There was growing unrest due to a severe economic situation, lack of democracy, and the aggravating presence of Soviet troops.

Summary:

On 23 October 1956 an estimated 200,000 Hungarian demonstrators, including workers, students, and soldiers, massed in Budapest and other major cities. They called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the return of Imre Nagy to power, progress toward democratization, and the development of Soviet-Hungarian relations on the basis of absolute equality. This was the trigger to the Soviet crisis, a perceived threat to unity in the Soviet bloc. Moscow responded on 1 November with a decision to remove the new government by military action.

A crisis was triggered for Hungary the same day: the Nagy government received reports of massive Soviet armor and tank formations crossing the Hungarian frontier. Hungary responded immediately by announcing its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. A message was also sent to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the issue of Hungarian neutrality be placed before the General Assembly. On 4 November the General Assembly passed a resolution calling for Soviet withdrawal from Hungary; but this had no effect on the Soviet Union's actions or the termination of the crisis.

On 4 November the Soviets removed the Nagy government by force and installed in power a more compliant puppet regime. Nagy was later shot. The Soviet crisis ended on 14 November with the end of Hungarian armed resistance. For Hungary, crisis termination occurred in January 1957, when organized resistance by Hungarian workers was crushed.

The U.S. issued a protest against Soviet interference in Hungary, but acquiesced in the reassertion of Moscow's hegemony in Budapest.
