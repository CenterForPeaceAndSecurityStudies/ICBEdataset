CRISNO 132

KOREAN WAR I

Background:

The first international crisis related to the Korean War began on 25 June and ended on 30 September 1950. There were four crisis actors: South Korea, formally the Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States, the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the Republic of China (ROC or Taiwan).

Pre-crisis There was constant tension, and minor incidents were reported in 1949. That year, too, General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers (SCAP) and de facto ruler in Japan, and Secretary of State Acheson had defined Korea as beyond the U.S. defense perimeter in East Asia. The Chinese Communist regime was preoccupied with internal reconstruction after the China civil war (see Case #125--China Civil War, in 1948-49, in Multiregional PCs: Taiwan Strait), and plans were made for a probable invasion of Taiwan in 1950. From September 1949 until June 1950 the South Korean leader, Syngman Rhee, frequently announced a "march-to-the-north" policy, to unify Korea by force. During June 1950 Kim Il-Sung, the leader of North Korea, initiated an all-out campaign for the reunification of Korea.

Summary:

On 25 June 1950 forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) (North Korea) invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) (South Korea) by crossing the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between the two Koreas. This triggered a crisis for South Korea and the United States. Rhee responded the same day with an appeal to the U.S. for military aid. On 27 June President Truman authorized U.S. forces to fight alongside troops of the ROK. He also reacted to the critical situation developing between the two Chinas by ordering the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait and establishing a naval blockade. This was the trigger for the PRC, whose plans for the invasion of Taiwan were complicated by a possible combined U.S.-Taiwan invasion of the mainland.

The PRC response, on 28 June, was contained in a speech by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai accusing the U.S. of aggression. Taiwan, still fearful of a Chinese Communist invasion, as PRC forces were massed along the coast, perceived Zhou's speech as a threat with possible grave consequences and responded the following day with general mobilization.

A U.S.-sponsored resolution at the Security Council was passed on 25 June by a vote of 9 to 0, with Yugoslavia abstaining and the Soviet Union absent--its delegates had walked out of the Council. The resolution condemned the North Korean attack and demanded the immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of North Korean forces to the 38th Parallel. A second Security Council resolution, on 27 June (7 to 1, with Yugoslavia opposed, India and Egypt abstaining, and the Soviet Union still absent), called on UN members to provide assistance to South Korea. And on 7 July, after U.S. and ROK forces had come under heavy attack and had been driven southward, the Security Council passed a third resolution in the USSR's absence--7 to 0, with India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia abstaining: it urged all members to contribute forces to a UN Unified Command. U.S. General MacArthur was appointed to lead the combined forces.

The PRC crisis faded in July as events in the area merged with the ongoing Korean War. There was no specific United Nations action concerning the PRC/Taiwan crisis.

The Soviet attitude and role are now known. After almost a year of hesitation, according to official USSR documents, Stalin gave Kim Il-Sung a "green light" to launch a full-scale attack on South Korea: first, in a message to the Korean leader on 30 January 1950, via the Soviet embassy in Pyongyang--"tell him that I am ready to help him in this matter [a large matter in regard to South Korea such as he wants to undertake]"; and second, during a meeting with Kim in Moscow in April 1950. Thereafter Soviet military advisors were sent to North Korea to help plan the campaign, along with a large amount of weapons and supplies. The Soviet Union also provided air cover over North Korean cities. Kim Il-Sung also secured the support of Mao Tse-tung at a meeting in Beijing in May.

By 29 September 1950 UN forces had restored control of South Korea to the Rhee government, and the crisis ended for South Korea and the United States. The following day the crisis ended for Taiwan with the reduction of intensity of the conflict.
