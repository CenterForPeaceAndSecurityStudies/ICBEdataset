CRISNO 360

SOUTH AFRICA RAID ON LESOTHO

Background:

Lesotho experienced another crisis with the Union of South Africa from 20 December 1985 to 25 January 1986.

Background and Pre-crisis The Pretoria regime's regional goal during the 1980s was nonaggression pacts with its neighbors. The policy was successful with Swaziland (February 1982) and Mozambique (March 1984). However, it failed vis-Ã -vis Botswana (see Case #355).

Lesotho, too, resisted South Africa's pressure (see Case #339). In early 1985 relations improved when the totally encircled kingdom imposed stricter security controls along the border. However, in October 1985 Lesotho unexpectedly requested the UN to take "urgent, necessary and appropriate measures to deter and disarm the oppressive regime" in South Africa.

Summary:

Two raids on its capital, Maseru, on 20 December 1985, killing nine people, triggered a crisis for Lesotho. South Africa, the alleged culprit, denied its involvement but reaffirmed its concern over the continued presence of hostile, pro-ANC groups in its neighbor states.

On 30 December the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning South Africa's unprovoked violent acts against Lesotho and demanded compensation to the victim state. On 1 January 1986 Pretoria imposed a de facto blockade of Lesotho, justifying it as necessary to prevent "terrorist [ANC] infiltration" into South Africa. In fact, the blockade was designed to achieve several goals: to persuade Lesotho to sign a nonaggression agreement; to expel ANC activists; and to stop the activities of Soviet-bloc advisors in Lesotho.

Lesotho responded on 14 January with an appeal to the UN, the U.K., and the U.S. to mount an airlift of food and essential supplies to the besieged kingdom. If necessary, it warned, it would turn to the Soviet bloc for assistance.

As a consequence of the blockade the Prime Minister, Chief Jonathan, was deposed on 20 January: the king was given power to rule by decree, advised by the military.

South Africa welcomed the internal change in Lesotho, as evident in the easing of the blockade on 20 January. The two states signed a mutual security agreement on the 21st. And border restrictions were completely lifted on the 25th, marking the end of Lesotho's--and the international--crisis.

The U.S. and the USSR were marginally involved.
