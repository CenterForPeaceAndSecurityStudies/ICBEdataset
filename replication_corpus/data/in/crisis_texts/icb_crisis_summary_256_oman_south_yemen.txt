CRISNO 256

OMAN-SOUTH YEMEN

Background:

South Yemen's active military assistance to Omani rebels created a crisis for Oman from 18 November 1973 to 11 March 1976.

Background Fighting in Oman's eastern province of Dhofar between rebels and the sultan's army began in 1963. After independence in 1967 South Yemen increased support to the rebels. By 1970 the insurgents' control extended to all of Dhofar. The traditional sultan was deposed by his son in July 1970. This was followed by a lull in the fighting, and the more liberal sultan was able to gain some tribal support. After the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf in 1971, the area was characterized by a power vacuum. Oman's independence was proclaimed at the end of 1971. In 1972 the Omani forces, strengthened by British, Iranian, and Jordanian troops, along with financial aid and arms from Sa'udi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, succeeded in turning the campaign in their favor.

The focal point of tension between Oman and South Yemen had been the latter's support to the insurgents, along with Iraq, both in training (with arms supplied by the People's Republic of China) and in active participation in fighting. Rights over the Kuria Muria Islands, located off the Dhofar coast, were also in dispute. Clashes occurred on the Oman/South Yemen border in 1972, mainly as a result of an incursion into Dhofar by left-wing guerrillas operating from South Yemen. On 15 April 1973 Iran sent additional forces to Oman.

Summary:

On 18 November 1973 the Oman government announced that a military post had been attacked by South Yemen aircraft and that South Yemen forces were actively engaged in the fighting in Dhofar. Oman's response, on 22 December, was a successful military campaign to free the Muscat-Salala road held by the rebels. Oman's growing economic strength had enabled it to purchase large quantities of military equipment and to expand the army. On 28 January 1975 it was reported that guerrilla supply lines from South Yemen had been blocked. The rebels were completely cut off from supplies by October. And by the end of 1975 the insurgents had been driven out of their last strongholds in Dhofar and had crossed into South Yemen. cease-fire

South Yemen and Oman signed a cease-fire on 11 March 1976, under the auspices of Sa’udi mediation. Kuwait had attempted to mediate and drew up a plan that eventually came to fruition under Sa’udi Arabia’s leadership. The plan was for Sa’udi Arabia to pay South Yemen’s bankrupt government $400 million over five years in exchange for a halt to South Yemen’s assistance to the rebels in Oman. This resulted in a South Yemeni and Sa’udi statement of mutual friendship on 10 March and the cease-fire with Oman on the following day.

In May 1974 the League of Arab States (LAS) had created a conciliation commission that attempted to mediate, but without success. An LAS proposal for an international force to replace the non-Arab troops was refused by the sultan, who was willing to welcome it only if the Arab force consented to fight alongside the existing forces.

Oman received military assistance from the U.S. As South Yemen's relations with the Soviet bloc improved, the USSR increased arms supplies to the rebels.

The UN was not involved in this crisis.
