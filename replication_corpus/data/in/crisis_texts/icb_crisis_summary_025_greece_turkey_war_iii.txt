CRISNO 25

GREECE-TURKEY WAR III

Background:

Greece experienced a crisis with Turkey in the last phase of their spasmodic war from 26 August to 15 September 1922.

Background After Greece's severe defeat in the last stage of its 1921 military campaign in Anatolia the major powers initiated an armistice proposal. It was rejected by Mustafa Kemal because it did not provide for total Greek evacuation of Anatolia. The Turkish nationalists had also strengthened their position politically through a tacit alliance with France--the Andara Accord of October 1921. And Greece, facing serious economic problems at home, could not resume the war. The result was a lull in hostilities for more than 11 months.

Summary:

Turkish nationalist forces launched a surprise multipronged attack on 26 August 1922 designed to expel all Greek forces from Anatolia. This triggered a crisis for Greece. The Turks, facing little resistance, recaptured Eskisehir, Afyon, and Dumlupinar. The Greeks were soon in full retreat. On 9 September they were compelled to relinquish the supreme prize, Smyrna (Izmir). By 15 September all Greek forces had evacuated Anatolia, marking the end of this crisis and the Greece/Turkey War of 1920-22. Turkey had won an unqualified victory; and Greece had suffered a humiliating defeat.

No other state actor was involved. The League of Nations too was inactive in this crisis.

The outcome reinforced deep-rooted mutual resentment and hostility that were further strengthened by crises over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea in the 1970s and 1980s (see Cases #202, #223, #257, #272, #349, #376).
