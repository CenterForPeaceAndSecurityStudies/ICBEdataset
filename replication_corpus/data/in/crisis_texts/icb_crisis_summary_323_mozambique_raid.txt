CRISNO 323

MOZAMBIQUE RAID

Background:

Mozambique experienced an inconclusive crisis with the Union of South Africa from 30 January to late March 1981.

Background and Pre-crisis South Africa targeted most of its neighbors as part of a lengthy struggle against the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1970s and 1980s. These generally brief crises took the form of cross-border raids against alleged ANC bases--in Zambia (see Case #244), in Angola (see Cases #297, #302, #308, #313, #331, in Angola PC), and in Lesotho (see Case #339).

On 26 November 1980 Prime Minister P. W. Botha publicly warned South Africa's neighbors that continued support for ANC guerrillas would result in cross-border raids by the South Africa Defence Forces (SADF). On 28 January 1981 he announced the arrest of a KGB officer, Major Alexei Mikhailovich Kozlov, who was accused of spying in South Africa on behalf of the ANC and SWAPO.

Summary:

The trigger to Mozambique's crisis was a SADF raid on 30 January 1981, which destroyed ANC headquarters in Matola, a suburb of the capital, Maputo. The SADF reported 30 ANC members and two of its soldiers killed.

On 8 February the ANC president, Oliver Tambo, denied that there were ANC bases or training camps in Mozambique. The presence of Soviet warships in Mozambique waters at the time--the USSR and Mozambique had signed a treaty of cooperation in 1977--raised the stakes by adding a Cold War dimension to the South Africa/ANC conflict. On 19 February Soviet Ambassador Vdovin was reported to have warned of an "appropriate response" if "anyone attacks us or our friends." No such attacks occurred. There was a further minor border incident on 17 March; and the crisis faded late in March 1981, without an agreement, formal, informal, or tacit.

While the Soviet Union was involved in this crisis through the presence of a naval flotilla, the U.S. remained aloof. And the UN did not play a role in abating the crisis.
