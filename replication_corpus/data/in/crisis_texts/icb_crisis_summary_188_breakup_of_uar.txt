CRISNO 188

BREAKUP OF UAR

Background:

The duration of Egypt's crisis was from 28 September to 5 October 1961.

Background A number of high-ranking right-wing Syrian officers in the army of the United Arab Republic formed an alliance with civilian politicians connected with the Syrian business class. Secret talks were held between these Syrians and Nasir's representative, Vice President Field Marshal 'Amer, where strong dissatisfaction with the UAR was expressed.

Summary:

A coup in Syria on the night of 27-28 September 1961 triggered a crisis for Egypt on the 28th. The restoration of Syria's independence was demanded, and this was viewed by Nasir as a threat directed at Egypt's influence in the Middle East subsystem. Nasir immediately ordered the UAR armed forces to suppress the rebellion. Two thousand paratroops supported the First Army, followed by the entire UAR navy and more troop reinforcements in ships. The following day, the ports of Aleppo and Latakia were taken by the rebels. When Nasir learned this, he ordered the ships to turn back arguing that the reconquest of Syria was almost impossible unless a substantial part of the Syrian army remained loyal to the UAR. Egypt's primary crisis management technique was negotiations with Syrian leaders, but Cairo was unable to persuade them to continue Syria's merger with Egypt. The crisis terminated on 5 October when the end of the Union was admitted to have taken place. Nasir announced that he would not oppose the application of the new Syrian regime for readmission into the United Nations and the Arab League.

The UN, the U.S., and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.

(After the termination of the crisis, on 9 and 10 October, respectively, the USSR and the U.S. recognized the new regime in Syria.)
