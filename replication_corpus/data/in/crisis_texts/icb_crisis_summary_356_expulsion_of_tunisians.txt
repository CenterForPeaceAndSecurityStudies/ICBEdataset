CRISNO 356

EXPULSION OF TUNISIANS

Background:

Tunisia experienced a crisis with Libya from 21 August to 26 September 1985 over the mass expulsion of Tunisians.

Background and Pre-crisis The relations between these two North African Arab neighbors were chronically unstable. Since the Raid on Gafsa (see Case #311), there was an improvement, especially between the summer of 1984 and the spring of 1985. As a result, a cooperation agreement was signed between them at the end of December 1984, covering trade, security, industry, employment, and culture. Nonetheless, because of declining oil revenues and a costly development program, Libya decided to expel 38,000 foreign workers in August 1985, of whom 30,000 were Tunisians. Tunisia protested this unilateral act. Qaddhafi tried to pressure Tunisia into a political union. On 18 August Tunisia accused Libya of violating its airspace: it closed the Libyan cultural center, news agency, and airline in Tunis, expelled 253 Libyans who were accused of threatening its internal and external security, and declared 30 Libyan diplomats persona non grata.

Summary:

On 21 August 1985 Libya accused Tunisia of participating in an "imperialist" anti-Libya plot, triggering a crisis for its neighbor. A buildup of Libyan troops near the border with Tunisia--and Egypt--was reported. The next day Tunisian forces were placed on alert, to prevent a possible attack by Libya. On the 23rd and again on 31 August and 23 September, Tunisia accused Libya of violating its airspace and of preparing for war. It also summoned home the remaining Tunisian migrant workers in Libya.

On 26 September Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with Libya and announced the suspension of air traffic between the two countries. This terminated Tunisia's crisis; but relations with Libya remained strained.

The Arab League and, independently, Morocco and Kuwait tried to mediate the crisis, without success. The U.S. on 26 August, and Algeria's president during a visit to Tunisia on 2 September, announced their support of Tunisia's territorial integrity. Moreover, the U.S. made an effort to mediate in the crisis and had a marginal effect at reducing tensions. Neither the USSR nor the UN was involved in this crisis.

(Ten years later, in September 1995, another exodus from Libya occurred: Qaddhafi publicly acknowledged that he was expelling thousands of Palestinians from Libya--to punish PLO leaders for agreeing to limited self-rule, in negotiations with Israel. Attempted mediation by Egypt was not successful.)
