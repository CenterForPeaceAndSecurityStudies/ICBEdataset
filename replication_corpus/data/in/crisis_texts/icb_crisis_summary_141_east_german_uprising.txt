CRISNO 141

EAST GERMAN UPRISING

Background:

A crisis for the Soviet Union over East German riots began on 17 June and terminated on 11 July 1953.

Background The East German uprising in 1953 can be traced to a hard-line decision of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) on 12 July 1952, calling for "the Construction of Socialism" in East Germany (the DDR): higher taxes; priority to heavy industry; collectivization of agriculture; hostility to the churches; and remilitarization. Dissent grew steadily.

Following Stalin's death in March 1953, greater attention was devoted to consumer goods by the USSR, and the DDR's Walter Ulbricht was advised to follow suit. Nevertheless, on 28 May 1953 an increased production quota system was introduced in East Germany. This prompted a strike by construction workers on 16 June, a spontaneous demonstration directed against the ruling party on strictly economic grounds. Toward the end of the day, although the government had agreed to roll back the new quotas, a general strike was called for the following day.

Summary:

On 17 June 1953 workers went on strike and marched in East Berlin and 400 other towns in the DDR. Economic grievances took on political overtones, while throngs of people rioted. This triggered an external crisis for the USSR (as well as a major domestic crisis for East Germany). A state of emergency was declared in the DDR, and martial law was introduced. Moscow's response, the same day, was to send tanks and Soviet troops stationed in bases inside the DDR to East Berlin where they were supported by East German paramilitary police. These forces succeeded in quelling the rebellion, after 125 died and thousands were arrested.

The Soviets perceived these riots as a dangerous precedent--as it was to be for the Hungarian Uprising in 1956-57 (see Case #155) and a threat to their East European bloc. On 11 July martial law was lifted in the DDR, ending Moscow's crisis. It also put the official seal on a gradual process that led to the reduction of the Soviet presence. The Western powers limited themselves to psychological warfare, especially via the Radio in the American Sector (RIFS), and diplomatic notes on the need to cease hostilities, as well as urging German reunification.

The UN was not involved in this crisis.
