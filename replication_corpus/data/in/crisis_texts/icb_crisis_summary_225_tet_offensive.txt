CRISNO 225

TET OFFENSIVE

Background:

The Tet crisis for South Vietnam and the United States began on 30 January and ended on 31 March 1968.

Pre-crisis "Operation Rolling Thunder" marked a basic U.S. policy change aimed at compelling the enemy to negotiate on Washington's terms. By the end of 1966 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam had increased to 375,000. The escalation of the air war proceeded steadily. In early 1965, too, the USSR and China began to provide economic assistance and military equipment to Hanoi. The U.S. bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail and retreating enemy troops in Cambodia. Bombing was stopped briefly on two occasions in an effort to bring about negotiations, but Hanoi's demand to seat the FLN (communist-controlled Front Liberation National) of South Vietnam at the conference table as a full and equal partner was rejected by the U.S. Raids were resumed with greater U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

In 1967 an important shift in Soviet policy occurred, indicating a desire to end the war. Each side began by softening its position, leading to cautious optimism. In the summer of 1967 a North Vietnamese offensive undermined that appraisal. North Vietnam's attempt to turn the tide of the war and to place Hanoi and the Vietcong in a stronger position for negotiations led to an attack on a U.S. marine outpost near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Vietnam on 21 January 1968. The Vietcong announced a three-day truce from the 27th, but South Vietnam revealed its decision to continue the bombing of the North. During the Tet (lunar New Year) holiday the Vietcong launched its biggest offensive.

Summary:

On 30 January 1968 a Vietcong attack on Saigon, Hué, and 36 of the 44 provincial capitals in South Vietnam, along with military installations and district towns, triggered another intrawar crisis for South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese responded on 2 February by urging an extension of U.S. bombing of North Vietnam to cover all military objectives. After heavy fighting the Vietcong were expelled from all the towns into which they had infiltrated.

A state of martial law in the south was declared by President Thieu. In Saigon a 24-hour curfew was imposed so that the South Vietnam army could drive out the Vietcong unhindered by the civilian population. American infantry and tanks were rushed to the city on 1 February, and a U.S. general assumed control of the whole operation. The main Vietcong forces withdrew on 3 February; but on the 18th another attack was launched in and around the capital. Fighting continued until the 24th, when the Vietcong troops were expelled once more. This terminated the Tet crisis for South Vietnam. The U.S. ordered more combat troops into the area.

A pessimistic report on 27 February by the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, on the situation in Vietnam shocked Washington and triggered a U.S. crisis. President Johnson's major response to the Tet Offensive was an announcement on 31 March that he had ordered a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and had renewed a U.S. willingness to negotiate. This policy decision ended the U.S. crisis, for it marked the beginning of a fundamental change in Washington's appraisal of the Vietnam War.

The Vietcong was defeated militarily; but it scored a psychological and political victory. Its belief that a massive offensive against the cities and towns would demonstrate the weakness of the government in the South and bring about a general uprising of civilians proved wrong and caused its military defeat; but the battle raised public opposition in the U.S. to a new level of intensity. The president and his advisors were shocked by the suddenness and magnitude of the Tet Offensive; and this crisis proved to be a turning point on the American path to disengagement from Vietnam five years later.

The mediation efforts by UN Secretary-General U Thant during the Tet crisis proved ineffective. On 8 February 1968 U Thant met with a representative of the North Vietnamese government in New Delhi. A week later, a North Vietnamese diplomat informed U Thant that Hanoi would begin talks with the U.S. in return for an unconditional cessation of American bombings. Upon his return to the U.S., U Thant met with President Johnson and Ambassador Goldberg on 21 February. Johnson regarded the Secretary-General’s report as inconclusive and rejected North Vietnam’s request.

The Warsaw Pact condemned South Vietnam and the U.S. Soviet involvement included active military personnel in the antiaircraft operations by the North and the supply of arms to Hanoi.
