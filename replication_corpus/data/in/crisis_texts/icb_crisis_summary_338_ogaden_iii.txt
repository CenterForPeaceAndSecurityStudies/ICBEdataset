CRISNO 338

OGADEN III

Background:

Somalia and Ethiopia experienced another crisis over the Ogaden Desert from 30 June until August 1982.

Summary:

Another international crisis erupted on 30 June 1982, when Ethiopian troops attacked Somali army units in the Hiran region, thereby threatening to sever communications between the two halves of Somalia. Ethiopia was accused by Mogadishu of "naked aggression." And on 12 July Somalia's President Barré sought OAU and UN support against Ethiopia's alleged plans for full-scale war. Two days later Africa's regional organization called upon Ethiopia to desist from destabilizing East Africa.

Somalia responded with an urgent request to the U.S. for assistance. The U.S. began a flow of arms and economic aid in July, in accordance with a 1980 agreement that granted U.S. forces valuable naval and air facilities at the northern Somali port of Berbera. U.S. aid triggered a crisis for Ethiopia, which declared on 26 July that this posed a threat to its territorial integrity. Ethiopia also denied that it had invaded Somalia.

Barré declared a state of emergency in the war zone on 15 September, following Ethiopia's successful incursion 20 miles into Somali territory. However, with no further advances by either party, the crisis faded in August 1982.

The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
