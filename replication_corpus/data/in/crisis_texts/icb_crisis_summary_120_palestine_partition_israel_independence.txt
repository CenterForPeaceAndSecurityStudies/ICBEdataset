CRISNO 120

PALESTINE PARTITION/ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE

Background:

The first of many international crises in the protracted Arab/Israel conflict had six direct participants: Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Israel. It lasted from 29 November 1947 until 20 July 1949.

Pre-crisis Viewed in interstate terms the conflict generated a crisis only with the birth pangs of the Jewish state in 1947-48. The situation in Palestine deteriorated rapidly as it became clear to all parties that the U.K., the Mandatory Power, was planning to relinquish its control over the area. As riots and instability increased, the decision regarding the future political solution for Palestine was placed on the UN agenda.

Summary:

The UN General Assembly Resolution of 29 November 1947, calling for the partition of Palestine into two independent states, one Arab, the other predominantly Jewish, triggered a crisis for Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Their initial response was a four-day summit meeting of Arab states on 8 December. On the 17th the Arab League reaffirmed its determination to maintain Palestine as an Arab state and announced plans to recruit an army of volunteers from League members.

The other Arab states objected to Jordan's plan to annex all of Palestine when the British Mandate ended. No further action was taken until May 1948.

Arab attacks on Jewish settlements in Palestine preceded the British evacuation; but regular Arab armies did not enter the area until the end of the Mandate on 14 May 1948.

The proclamation of the State of Israel on 14-15 May 1948, though anticipated, sharply escalated the crisis for the five Arab states. Plans for a combined army of Arab League forces, to be organized under an Iraqi commander, fell through; and directives were sent to each country to dispatch regular forces to Palestine. All the Arab states perceived a serious threat--the loss of territory that for centuries had been an integral part of the "Arab world." They responded by invading Israel on 15 May--Syria and Lebanon in the north, Jordan and Iraq in the east, and Egypt in the south. The Arab invasion triggered an existence crisis for the new state. Israel responded the same day by dispatching its newly formed regular army to fight on all fronts. A struggle for influence among Arab states and their fear that Jordan's King Abdullah would enlarge his domain by annexing all of Palestine and part of Syria accentuated the Arab decision to fight but created the seeds of disunity and disharmony in the first Arab/Israel war.

The crisis ended at different times for different participants. Fighting in the north ended on 30 October 1948 for Lebanon and Syria in defeat; but it was their armistice agreements with Israel on 23 March and 20 July 1949, respectively, that marked the termination of their crisis. With Iraq, unlike the four other Arab states, there was no formal agreement to end the war; but fighting effectively ceased after 18 July 1948. Fighting ended for Egypt with its defeat in Sinai in early January 1949 (see Case #128); and an armistice agreement was signed on 24 February 1949. The war ended for Israel after it captured Eilat on the Red Sea, and the Israeli government ratified the armistice agreement with Egypt on 10 March 1949. Israel and Jordan signed their armistice agreement on 3 April 1949. The last of the four armistice agreements was signed with Syria on 20 July 1949.

The UN was intensely involved in this crisis, arranging four truce agreements and brokering armistice agreements through the mediation of Count Folke Bernadotte and, after his assassination on 17 September 1948, Under-Secretary-General Ralph Bunche. Bernadotte intended to find a settlement based on the military status quo and not the UN Partition lines (i.e., to give Israel all of Galilee and Jordan the Negev). He mediated a series of truces that ultimately proved unsuccessful. When Bunche assumed the mediation duties, he wanted to replace the truces with more permanent armistices, and he used bilateral negotiations between Israel and each Arab state, beginning with Egypt, as the means to do so. In addition to Bunche’s mediation efforts, the UN General Assembly agreed to the creation of the Palestine Conciliation Commission (PCC) on 11 December 1948. The PCC had a more ambitious goal of using mediation to achieve permanent peace treaties among the belligerents but failed. Bunche’s mediation of the bilateral armistices between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria proved most instrumental in achieving crisis management.

The two superpowers and the former Mandatory Power were actively involved: the USSR as the primary source of weapons for the State of Israel acting indirectly through Czechoslovakia; the U.S. and the U.K. playing an important political role within and outside the UN.
