CRISNO 92

GERMAN OCCUPATION OF HUNGARY

Background:

Hungary's intrawar crisis with Germany lasted from 13 to 19 March 1944.

Pre-crisis After Italy's capitulation to the Allies in September 1943 (see Case #91), Germany began to consider the possibility of a similar fate for Hungary and Romania, and plans were made for German occupation of both countries. While Romania was perceived to be a lesser problem, it was known that Hungary had begun to send out feelers for an armistice agreement with the Allies. German plans for the occupation of Hungary were operationalized on 12 March, as Soviet forces moved rapidly toward the Hungarian frontier.

Summary:

The concentration of German troops around Vienna and on the Hungarian frontier triggered a crisis for Hungary on 13 March 1944. Two days later, Hitler demanded that Hungary's Regent, Admiral Horthy, meet with him. While Horthy deliberated his decision, fearing his detention and arrest while Germany occupied Hungary, the Allies decided finally to seek an armistice with Hungary and therefore dropped a U.S. mission into that country on 17 March to discuss terms of surrender. By 18 March Horthy had decided that he was compelled to see Hitler at any cost, and set out to do so.

Horthy was detained for one day, under the pretext of an air raid, and allowed to reach the Hungarian frontier as German troops began their invasion. On 19 March Hungary was occupied by Germany with no real resistance. The U.S. mission was turned over to the German forces, and Hungary's capitulation ended its crisis.
