CRISNO 337

WAR IN LEBANON

Background:

Lebanon, Syria, and Israel were the crisis actors in the Lebanon War from 5 June 1982 until 17 May 1983.

Background From the beginning of the Arab/Israel protracted conflict in 1947-48 (see Case #120) until 1970, the border between Israel and Lebanon was relatively quiescent. However, as a result of the PLO's severe defeat in a military confrontation with the regime of King Hussein in 1970 (see Case #238--Black September, in Middle East: Non-PCs), most of its forces were transferred from Jordan to bases in south Lebanon. From there they launched raids into northern Israel in a prolonged guerrilla campaign.

The PLO also became enmeshed in Lebanon's intercommunal strife, a near constant in the Christian-Muslim struggle for control of the government and army in Lebanon since 1943. Full-scale civil war erupted in April 1975.

On 14 March 1978, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded Lebanon in retaliation for a PLO raid in Israel's heartland, north of Tel Aviv, three days earlier, in which 35 Israelis were killed and 70 others wounded. Hostilities ended at the end of March, but IDF units did not withdraw until 13 June 1978 (see Case #289).

Pre-crisis An Israeli decision in principle to attack PLO bases in Lebanon was made on 21 April 1982. On 9 May 100 Katyusha rockets were fired from south Lebanon into Israel's northern Galilee settlements. IDF troops were dispatched to the Lebanese border several days later. On 3 June Israel's Ambassador to the U.K., Shlomo Argov, was gravely wounded in a terrorist attack in London. Israeli planes bombed PLO sites in Beirut.

Summary:

At the instigation of Israel Defense Minister Sharon, IDF forces responded to the London incident by activating a long-standing "Peace for Galilee" operation: they invaded Lebanon on 5 June along three fronts, triggering a crisis for Lebanon. Jerusalem signaled Damascus via Washington that its forces would not cross into Syria unless Israel was attacked by Syrian forces. However, the rapid IDF advance in Lebanon brought Israeli forces into direct conflict with Syrian troops in the Biqa Valley of Lebanon on 7 June, catalyzing a crisis for Syria. This was accentuated on 8-9 June by an air battle that reportedly led to the shooting down of 60 Syrian planes. The direct confrontation with Syria led to a crisis for Israel.

Initial U.S. mediation, through special envoy Philip Habib, led to a temporary cease-fire between Israel and Syria on 11 June. However, continued IDF/PLO clashes led to a renewal of Israel/Syria hostilities. By 24 June IDF forces succeeded in cutting the strategic Beirut-Damascus highway, the key to Syria's military control over Lebanon. And by early July IDF forces laid siege to Beirut.

Persistent mediation by U.S. Ambassador Habib led to a complex agreement that resolved the crisis for Israel and Syria--but not the Lebanon War--on 1 September 1982. By that date the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Beirut, which began on 21 August, was complete. PLO forces completed their withdrawal from Lebanon on 1 September to nine locations in the Arab world, temporarily ceasing to be a meaningful military force in the Arab/Israel conflict. And IDF forces pulled back from the outskirts of Lebanon's capital. The crisis for Lebanon ended with the (abortive) peace agreement with Israel on 17 May 1983.

The UN and the U.S. were very active in efforts to resolve the crisis and terminate the Lebanon War. As early as 6 June the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to the recognized Israel-Lebanon border. A Security Council resolution on 20 June calling on both PLO and IDF forces to withdraw from the Beirut area was vetoed by the U.S. Altogether, nine UN resolutions were passed during the Lebanon War, including those on 1 and 12 August by the Security Council and 19 August by the General Assembly, most of them condemning Israel; but not one was heeded.

The U.S. role was far more consequential. On 8 July, along with France and Italy, it announced a willingness to send troops to Lebanon in order to reestablish stability. On 19 July Washington temporarily suspended military aid to Israel because of its invasion of Lebanon. On 5 August it called upon Israel to withdraw to the prewar cease-fire lines. As noted, the U.S. mediated an initial Israel/Syria cease-fire, and the agreement of 1 September 1982, which ended the Lebanon War, though not all hostilities. Washington, through Secretary of State Shultz, also brokered the abortive Israel/Lebanon agreement of 17 May 1983.

The USSR adopted a low profile vis-Ã -vis the Lebanon War, compared with its role in the 1956, 1967, and 1973 Arab/Israel wars (see Cases #152, #222, #255). It condemned Israel several times. Two messages were sent to PLO Chairman Arafat expressing verbal support for his cause. And, most substantively, it sent military aid to Syria to replace losses during the fighting. The Arab League did not meet until after the end of the Lebanon War. At a summit conference in Fez, Morocco, on 6-9 September, it proposed a peace plan for the Arab/Israel conflict, which was rejected by Israel.

(Direct talks between the governments of Israel and Lebanon under U.S. auspices, beginning in late December 1982, led to the initialing of a peace agreement on 17 May 1983. It included the creation of an Israeli "security zone" in south Lebanon designed to protect Israeli settlements in northern Galilee against PLO or other trans-border attacks. Syria, the most influential external power in the internal affairs of Lebanon, opposed the agreement as a grave danger to its security; and the Israel/Lebanon peace agreement was never ratified.)

(Low-intensity military hostilities in Lebanon and a massive IDF presence in Lebanon continued until 1985. IDF forces continued to control the "security zone" more than a decade later.)
