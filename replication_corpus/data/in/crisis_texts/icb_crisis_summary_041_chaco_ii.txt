CRISNO 41

CHACO II

Background:

A second crisis over Chaco between Paraguay and Bolivia began on 18 June 1932 and lasted until 12 June 1935.

Pre-crisis The issue of ownership of the vast undeveloped Chaco region remained in dispute since the crisis of 1928-29 (see Case #37). During the intervening years there were some incidents, but no serious fighting took place. On 11 November 1931 negotiations between the adversaries began on the question of a settlement of their territorial differences. A draft nonaggression pact was under consideration when the second crisis broke out.

Summary:

A Bolivian attack and occupation of a fort were reported on 18 June 1932 to the headquarters of the chief of the Paraguayan General Staff. On 15 July Paraguay responded with an attack on a Bolivian fort built after the 18 June incident. Three days later the loss of the fort was reported, triggering a crisis for Bolivia, which perceived a threat to its political regime. Bolivia responded during the night of 18 July by holding a special emergency cabinet meeting where the president ordered a major reprisal and the immediate capture of the areas of Corralo and Toledo. This was done on 27 and 28 July, and Boqueron was occupied by Bolivian forces on 31 July 1932.

A Paraguayan counterattack during August 1932 succeeded in recapturing these forts and also pushed the Bolivian army back several miles from the positions held prior to the outbreak of the crisis. A Bolivian counterattack occurred during November and December 1932.

On 10 May 1933 Paraguay declared war. A truce was proposed in December 1933, but on 6 January 1934 fighting resumed. On 17 November 1934 the Paraguayans captured a principal Bolivian supply base.

Paraguay had appealed to the League of Nations Council in 1932, under Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant. With U.S. approval, the Council sent a commission of inquiry. When a truce broke down, Bolivia appealed to the League under Article 15. The dispute was transferred to the 15th Session of the League Assembly in November 1934, and an inquiry committee was formed to prepare a report. Its recommendations were the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal and demobilization of armies, temporary policing of the evacuated zone, and neutral arbitration. They were accepted by Bolivia and rejected by Paraguay.

On 16 January 1935 the advisory committee of the Assembly unanimously adopted a recommendation to League members to lift their arms embargo on Bolivia but to maintain it against Paraguay. Paraguay announced its intention to leave the League on 23 February, and the next day the recommendations went into effect.

Paraguay occupied most of the Chaco in a series of military campaigns. But military advantage began to swing in Bolivia's favor. The final phase of the negotiations for an armistice in the Chaco began on 27 May 1935 when Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and the United States began negotiations with the now exhausted states of Bolivia and Paraguay over a new protocol based upon the League of Nations' recommendations, with some modifications to pacify Paraguay. This mediation effort began after both sides exhausted most military options, which contributed to the relative success of this instance of mediation as contrasted to previous mediation attempts. An agreement was reached on 9 June and signed on 12 June 1935, ending the crisis for both actors. The agreement provided for the cessation of hostilities and the holding of a peace conference. About 90,000 soldiers died in South America's deadliest war of the twentieth century.

President Roosevelt issued a proclamation on 28 May 1934 prohibiting the sale of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. This was eventually agreed to by France, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the U.K.

Mediation was attempted by the neutral Commission of Washington (Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, and the U.S.); by the ABCP group (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru); and by the united efforts of all the neutral American states of the Pan American Conference at Montevideo in December 1933.

(Peace was not formally restored until 10 July 1938 and was approved by a plebiscite on 10 August. The peace treaty provided for arbitration of the boundaries. An arbitral award, by six American presidents, on 10 October 1938, gave most of the Chaco territory to Paraguay, along with an outlet to the sea via the Paraguay River for Bolivia.)
