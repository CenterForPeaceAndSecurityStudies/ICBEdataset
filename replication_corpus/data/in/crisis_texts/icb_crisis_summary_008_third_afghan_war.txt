CRISNO 8

THIRD AFGHAN WAR

Background:

A crisis-war between Afghanistan and the U.K., acting through British India, lasted from 15 April until 8 August 1919.

Background Modern Afghanistan emerged in 1747 as a loose union of previously autonomous tribes. From the outset its geography--a landlocked state in Central Asia between czarist Russia and British India--shaped its foreign policy. After a phase of expansion (1747-1800) and a period of foreign conflict, with Persia (Iran), the Sikh Empire in the Punjab, Russia, and India (1800-80), Afghanistan under Amir Abdur Rahman (1880-1901) accepted British tutelage in foreign affairs. This protectorate status continued under Amir Habibullah (1901-19), who tried, but failed, to secure London's acquiescence in full independence in return for Afghan neutrality during World War I.

Pre-crisis On 2 February 1919 Habibullah wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, seeking Afghan representation at the Paris Peace Conference and recognition of Afghanistan's "absolute liberty, freedom of action and perpetual independence." The negative response from Delhi contributed to his growing unpopularity, which led to his assassination on 19 February. In the struggle for succession his son Amir Amanullah assumed the throne. On 3 March he reiterated the demand for recognition of "our independent and free Government of Afghanistan," in a letter to the viceroy of India. He repeated this in a public proclamation a few days later and again on 13 April at a public darbar, or court reception, attended by the British agent in Kabul.

Summary:

The viceroy's reply to Amanullah's letter of 3 March, sent on 15 April, reaffirmed the protectorate status quo: "the alliance between the two Governments ... is based on the treaties and engagements" undertaken by his two predecessors. This rebuff initiated a crisis for Afghanistan. Amanullah responded at once by moving regular Afghan forces to the frontier with India: they arrived at the Khyber Pass on 2 May; and a skirmish with the Khyber Rifles occurred the next day. On the 4th Afghan troops cut the water supply to Landi Kotal, triggering a crisis for the U.K. Britain retaliated by closing the Khyber Pass. The viceroy wrote again on the 4th offering the amir an opportunity to disclaim responsibility for initiating hostilities, but it was too late. During 5-6 May Afghan forces occupied the towns of Kalat-I-Ghilzai and Khost. On the 9th British Indian forces counterattacked in the Khyber area.

Afghan forces suffered several setbacks during the next few weeks. As a result Amanullah sought negotiations for a cease-fire, which began in mid-June. Peace talks commenced in Rawalpindi, India, on 25 July. And a formal agreement was signed on 8 August 1919. Afghanistan's independence in foreign policy was acknowledged but the U.K.'s special status was reaffirmed. Thus ended the brief Third Afghan War and the international crisis for Afghanistan and the U.K.

(Formal recognition of complete Afghan independence from the British Empire was accorded at the Kabul Conference, which ended on 8 December 1921.) There was no global organization at the time of this crisis.
