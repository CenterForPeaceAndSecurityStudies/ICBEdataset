CRISNO 275

SYRIA MOBILIZATION

Background:

A Syrian army advance toward southern Lebanon precipitated a crisis for Israel from 21 November to 13 December 1976.

Background and Pre-crisis In an attempt to avoid the partition of Lebanon during the latter's civil war, Syrian troops entered Lebanon in January 1976 (see Case #265--Lebanon Civil War I, in Middle East: Non-PCs). By September Syria had defeated Palestinian and Lebanese Muslim leftists and remained in control of large areas of the country. In the middle of October a summit meeting of the heads of state of Arab countries took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. On 18 October a comprehensive peace plan for Lebanon was signed, setting up an Arab Deterrent Force, consisting almost entirely of Syrian troops. By 20 November Syria controlled all the key points in Lebanon with the exception of the area south of the Litani River bordering Israel. A tacit agreement was reached with Israel marking the Litani as the "Red Line," whereby both countries avoided confrontation.

Summary:

On 21 November, as Syrian forces pushed toward south Lebanon, Israel perceived a crisis, recognizing that Syria might break the tacit Red Line agreement, thereby undermining Israel's influence in Lebanon. Israel responded the following day by concentrating infantry and tanks along its northern border with Lebanon. In Jerusalem Prime Minister Rabin met with U.S. Ambassador Lewis to discuss the situation on 23 November, while in Washington talks were held between Ambassador Dinitz and U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger. The Syrians halted at the Litani River. By 13 December the situation stabilized and the tacit agreement between the two countries was restored, a process to which the U.S. contributed greatly. The USSR and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
