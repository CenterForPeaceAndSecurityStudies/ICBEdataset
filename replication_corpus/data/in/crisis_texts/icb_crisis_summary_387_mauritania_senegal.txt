CRISNO 387

MAURITANIA-SENEGAL

Background:

Senegal and Mauritania were enmeshed in a lengthy crisis from 21 August 1989 to 18 July 1991.

Background and Pre-crisis Both were part of the French empire in West Africa. For many years they formed a single electoral unit and were represented by the same senator in France's legislature. Mauritania was separated from Senegal politically in 1946. The two states became independent in 1960, Senegal initially as part of the Mali Federation--along with Soudan (later, Mali), Upper Volta, and Dahomey--from which it seceded in August 1960 (see Case #177).

The population of Senegal is entirely black African, that of Mauritania mixed Arab in the north, black African in the south. The border region, the most arable part of Mauritania, was cultivated by black Africans, competing with Senegalese across the Senegal River for limited water resources. At the root of the interstate conflict was increasing desertification, which drove Arab nomadic herders south toward black African farmlands on both sides of the border. As the value of the arable land rose, Mauritania denied Senegalese access to its land.

A series of nonmilitary violent incidents occurred in April 1989, notably on "Black Tuesday," the 25th, when hundreds were killed and injured leading to a wave of refugees. By early June 75,000 Senegalese and 170,000 Mauritanians had been airlifted to their homelands. And in July Mauritanian officials were forcibly expelling thousands of Senegalese workers across the river boundary to Senegal.

Summary:

It was this economically driven tension and violence between the people of the two countries that led to the crisis trigger for both states: on 21 August Senegal's ambassador to Mauritania was declared persona non grata; and the same day Senegal severed diplomatic relations with Mauritania.

The first of several military clashes occurred in October 1989. The armed forces of both states were strengthened in November and later by a spillover from a long-standing hostility and rivalry between Syria and Iraq: the former supported Senegal, the latter, Mauritania. Heavy artillery was exchanged in January 1990 affecting villages on both sides of the border. And intermittent outbreaks of violence occurred during the next 18 months. This low-intensity African crisis ended on 18 July 1991 with an agreement in principle to restore diplomatic relations.

UN involvement was low-key--a fact-finding mission dispatched by the Secretary-General, which had no effect on crisis abatement. Mediation efforts on the part of the OAU – begun under the leadership of Egypt’s President Mubarak prior to the onset of the crisis – had a marginal effect in decreasing tensions and facilitating successful negotiation. Both the U.S. and the USSR were aloof from this crisis.
