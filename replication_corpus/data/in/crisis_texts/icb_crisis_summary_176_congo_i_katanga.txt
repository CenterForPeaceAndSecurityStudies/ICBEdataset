CRISNO 176

CONGO I-KATANGA

Background:

The two crisis actors were Belgium and Congo. The crisis lasted from 5 July 1960 to 15 February 1962.

Background Belgian Congo was granted independence on 30 June 1960. Lumumba became the first Prime Minister and Defense Minister and Kasavubu the first President. The country had been plagued by tribal fighting and serious disorders. A Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in Leopoldville between Congo and Belgium.

Summary:

The trigger for Belgium, on 5 July 1960, was a mutiny among soldiers of the Congolese Force Publique which rapidly turned into a general assault against Belgian and other European residents. Belgium responded on the 8th by announcing its intention to send troop reinforcements to Congo. A crisis was triggered for Congo two days later when Belgian troops went into action.

Lumumba decried Belgium's alleged violation of their friendship treaty. A request to President Eisenhower to restore order was denied. Tshombe, leader of mineral-rich Katanga, announced its independence on 11 July, triggering a second Congo crisis. That day, too, Lumumba responded by appealing to the UN. Belgium announced on the 13th that it would not withdraw its troops. The Soviet Union issued a statement condemning what it termed Western and NATO aggression against Congo. On 14 July the UN Security Council passed a resolution to establish a UN military force in Congo and requested the withdrawal of Belgium's forces. Lumumba demanded the withdrawal of Belgian diplomats as well and declared a state of war between the two countries.

The resolution did not, however, accept Lumumba's demands to oust Tshombe and reintegrate Katanga by force. The two adversaries accepted the Security Council's resolution, though without enthusiasm, ending their dyadic crisis on the 15th.

Lumumba's forces began receiving aid from the USSR, and the split between him and Kasavubu increased. Internal developments in Congo prevented a quick solution. On 14 September 1960 Colonel Mobutu announced that the army was taking control. A new central government was finally formed on 9 February 1961. An announcement of Lumumba's death was made on 13 February. On 21 March the UN Secretary-General's Conciliation Committee on the Congo recommended a federal form of government to preserve the country's unity and integrity. On 1 August President Kasavubu invited Adoula, a moderate, to form a new government.

The UN Security Council passed a resolution calling upon the Secretary-General to organize and dispatch an emergency military force. Pressure was exerted by the U.S. to bring Tshombe and Adoula together. And on 18 December 1961 a provisional cease-fire was announced that led to the Kitona Agreement of 21 December, with a unilateral declaration by Tshombe that the Katanga secession was over and a pledge to recognize the indivisible unity of Congo Republic. The crisis ended for Congo on 15 February 1962 when the Katanga Assembly ratified Tshombe's declaration and agreed to end its secession.
