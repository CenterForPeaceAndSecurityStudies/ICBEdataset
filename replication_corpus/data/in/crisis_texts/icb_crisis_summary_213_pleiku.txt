CRISNO 213

PLEIKU

Background:

This intrawar crisis for the United States, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam lasted from 7 February to late March 1965.

Pre-crisis In the six months after the Gulf of Tonkin crisis, fighting took place between South and North Vietnam with minimum U.S. participation. In the United States a debate ensued regarding U.S. commitments to the government in Saigon which, on 27 January 1965, had been taken over by a military coup.

Summary:

A crisis for the United States and South Vietnam was triggered on 7 February 1965 when Vietcong guerrillas staged a night raid against U.S. and South Vietnam army barracks at Pleiku, killing eight and wounding 126. The U.S. response was a decision by President Johnson on the 13th, following a meeting of his National Security Council, in favor of measured and limited air action jointly with South Vietnam against selected military targets in North Vietnam. When news of "Operation Rolling Thunder" became public, on 19 February, it triggered an intrawar crisis (IWC) for North Vietnam.

The Pleiku crisis for the U.S. and South Vietnam ended on 2 March, the day the first of the U.S. air strikes began. This action marked a sharp escalation in the evolution of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. For North Vietnam the crisis faded later in March. There was no clear outcome: the U.S. was pulled deeper into the morass of Vietnam; the North Vietnamese suffered from--but learned to adapt to--increased U.S. bombing.

There was minimal UN activity: Secretary-General U Thant called for all sides to negotiate, but his efforts were unsuccessful. The USSR extended military aid to North Vietnam.
