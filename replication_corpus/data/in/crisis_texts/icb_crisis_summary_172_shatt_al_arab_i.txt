CRISNO 172

SHATT-AL-ARAB I

Background:

A crisis for Iraq and Iran over their joint waterway lasted from 28 November 1959 to 4 January 1960.

Summary:

The trigger for Iraq was a press conference on 28 November 1959 where the Shah described the status quo concerning the Shatt-al-Arab as "intolerable." Prime Minister Qassem's response, the trigger for Iran, was a reiteration of Iraq's claim to the waterway on 2 December. Border clashes were reported on 10 and 15 December. Iran's frontier guards were reinforced on the 15th. Iraq sent a protest two days later. On the 22nd Iraq claimed that numerous Iranian border violations had occurred, including an 11-kilometer penetration of its territory. On 23 December Iran placed its military forces on full alert; previously Iran had been moving troops to the Iraqi border. By the last week in December both actors had expressed a willingness to negotiate their differences. The termination date for both was 4 January 1960 when an Iranian ship was allowed to pass through the Shatt unmolested.

The U.S. and U.K. proposed talks between the adversaries; and the USSR broadcast propaganda against Iran. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
