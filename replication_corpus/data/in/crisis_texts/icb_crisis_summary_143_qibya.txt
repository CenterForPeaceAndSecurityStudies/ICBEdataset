CRISNO 143

QIBYA

Background:

There was one crisis actor--Jordan. The crisis was triggered on 14 October 1953. It had no exact termination date.

Background and Pre-crisis After the Arab/Israel War of 1948-49 (see Case #120), Arab refugees who had fled Palestine were placed in camps in Jordan where anti-Israel sentiments flourished. Infiltrations from Jordan into Israel began in 1951. In October 1953 the situation was exacerbated when Jordanian infiltrators murdered an Israeli woman and her two children.

Summary:

On 14 October 1953 a Jordan crisis was triggered when the Israel Defense Forces retaliated against the village of Qibya in Jordan, killing 69 civilians and destroying 45 houses. Jordan responded on the 16th by conferring with the U.S. and Britain, lodging a complaint with the Security Council, and calling for a meeting of the Arab League. This resulted in condemnation of Israel by both forums. Israel public opinion prompted its leaders to decide to refrain from attacks on civilian targets in the future. Infiltrations stopped for a while but were resumed after a few months.

The U.S. was involved politically, with little effect on the substance or timing of the outcome. The USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
