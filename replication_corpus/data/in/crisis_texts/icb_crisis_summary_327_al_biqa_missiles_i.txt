CRISNO 327

AL-BIQA MISSILES I

Background:

Syria and Israel, inveterate foes for almost half a century, were enmeshed in one of two missile crises over Lebanon in the 1980s from 28 April to 24 July 1981 (see also Case #357).

Background Lebanon was, formally, a member of the Arab coalition against Israel since the beginning of the Arab/Israel conflict in 1947-48. However, it participated only in the first war of the protracted conflict (see Case #120). During most of the next two decades the Israel/Lebanon border was quiet, apart from several PLO raids from southern Lebanon since the mid-1960s, which became more frequent after its expulsion from Jordan in 1970 (see Case #238--Black September, in Middle East: Non-PCs). One of Israel's most dramatic responses was the destruction of 13 planes at Beirut Airport in December 1968 (see Case #229). In May 1970 and February 1972, Israeli armor and planes attempted, with little success, to destroy PLO and, later, Hizbullah bases in southern Lebanon in retaliation for cross-border raids against Israeli settlements in northern Israel. It was a pattern that continued into the mid-1990s (see Case #409).

The outbreak of civil war in Lebanon in April 1975 made a complex situation more unstable. Syria, which had long assumed a hegemonial role in Lebanon, intervened, occupied the Biqa (Bekaa) Valley in eastern Lebanon, and established its primacy in the entire country in 1976 by skillful "divide and rule" tactics, shifting its alignment with the Christian and Muslim-Druze-PLO contending factions in what developed into a 16-year civil war (1975-91). A cease-fire in October 1976 led to the creation of a 30,000-man Arab Deterrent Force (ADF) by the Arab League: Syria was the preeminent contributor from the outset; and from 1979 the ADF was a purely Syrian force. At the same time the U.S. brokered a "Red Line" agreement between Israel and Syria in 1976 that specified legitimate acts and constraints on their behavior in Lebanon (see Case #275). The 1981 missile crisis centered on alleged violation of the Red Line agreement.

Pre-crisis In the spring of 1981 the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia, were ensconced in the strategic town of Zahle astride the Beirut-Damascus highway. Aware of impending general elections in Israel, which Begin's Likud-led coalition seemed likely to lose, the Christian Falange leaders tried to draw Israel into Lebanon's civil war--and succeeded.

Summary:

On 28 April 1981 Israeli planes shot down two Syrian helicopters carrying supplies to Syrian troops on Mount Sanin overlooking Zahle. Syria responded the next day by deploying SAM-3 ground-to-air missiles in Lebanon and attacking the Christian militia in Zahle. As threatened by Israel's prime minister, Israeli planes destroyed the Syrian missile bases on 28 May.

Both Israel and Syria accused each other of violating the 1976 Red Line agreement: by the use of Syrian air power against any party to the civil war and the introduction of missiles into Lebanon; and by Israel's intervention in the civil war with air power far north of the Israel/Lebanon border.

On 5 May the U.S. dispatched Philip Habib as a special envoy to mediate between the parties and to end the crisis. Moreover, in response to continuing Israeli bombing raids against Syrian positions and the PLO headquarters in Beirut, on 10 and 17 July, the U.S. froze the delivery of F-16 planes to Israel on 18 July; they were released on 11 August, after the cease-fire.

Crisis abatement was the result of mediation and pressure on both sides--the U.S. vis-à-vis Israel, and Sa'udi Arabia vis-à-vis Syria and the PLO. A cease-fire was negotiated separately with the PLO--formally with the Lebanon government--and Israel. It took effect on 24 July, ending the crisis for both Syria and Israel, the two state crisis actors, and the Al-Biqa crisis as a whole.

The U.S., as noted, played the decisive role in crisis resolution. The USSR supported Syria verbally and politically; and it held joint landing maneuvers with Syrian forces as an indicator of its intent if the crisis threatened to overthrow the Syrian regime. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
