CRISNO 401

NAGORNYY-KARABAKH

Background:

An international crisis between Armenia and Azerbaijan, part of a lengthy, still-unresolved conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh (N-K), erupted on 27 November 1991 and began to fade in mid-August 1992.

Background and Pre-crisis In the turmoil that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 (see Cases #1, #3--Russian Civil War I, II, in 1918-20, in Multiregional PCs: East/West), the southern regions of the czarist empire experienced a brief period of political independence: Georgia and Armenia declared their independence on 22 April 1918, Azerbaijan on 26 May 1918. By November 1920 the "Red" forces, freed by victory in the war against Poland (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC), triumphed over the "Whites" in the south. Soviet-style governments were established in Georgia and Armenia, on 25 February and 2 April 1921. On 12 March 1922 the three regions were integrated into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became part of the newly created USSR on 30 December of that year. In December 1936, under the terms of the "Stalin Constitution," each became an "independent" republic in the 11-member USSR. So they remained until the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991.

Despite its overwhelming Armenian Christian population, Nagornyy-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, was incorporated into the overwhelmingly Muslim republic of Azerbaijan in July 1921. Although it acquired the status of an Autonomous Oblast (District) in June 1923, this sowed the seeds of a bitter conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which erupted in the late 1980s.

It began with street protests in N-K in October 1987. An attempt by an N-K delegation in Moscow between November 1987 and February 1988 to secure the transfer of the enclave to Armenia failed. There were mass demonstrations in N-K's capital, Stepanakert, on 11 February 1988. A week later Gorbachev, as Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), termed the problem of nationalities "the most fundamental and most vital issue" for the USSR. On 20 February the N-K Soviet requested the transfer of the enclave to Armenia; this was rejected by the CPSU Central Committee two days later. And on 24 February Soviet troops were dispatched to the area of conflict.

Clashes, demonstrations, and pressure continued throughout 1988 and the first half of 1989. Among the most noteworthy occurrences in 1988 were the following: the Sumgait massacre on 29 February--32 killed and 197 injured in an anti-Armenian riot in a city near the Azeri capital, Baku; the reiterated demand of the N-K Regional Council (Soviet) on 12 March for a transfer of the disputed territory to Armenia; the replacement of the Communist Party leaders in Armenia and Azerbaijan on 21 May; Gorbachev's announcement on 28 June that the Soviet Union would not accept the Armenian demand; the first confrontation between troops and protesters in Armenia on 5 July, with one person killed, 36 injured; a unanimous vote of the N-K Regional Council on 12 July in favor of immediate secession from Azerbaijan; the proclamation of a state of emergency in N-K on 21 September; a mass demonstration and intervention by troops the next day; outbreaks of violence in Baku and two other cities in Azerbaijan on 22 November, causing the deaths of three soldiers and injuries to 126 civilians; a severe earthquake on 7 December that devastated northern Armenia; the arrest of most members of the pro-Armenian Karabakh committee on 10 December, leading to large-scale protests and clashes in Armenia's capital, Yerevan.

Direct rule over N-K was imposed by Moscow on 12 January 1989. And, as a measure of the cost of the escalating dispute, an official estimate of cumulative casualties on 7 February cited 87 civilians and four soldiers killed; more than 1,500 civilians, 115 soldiers, and 32 policemen injured. After a period of tranquility, Armenia proclaimed a union with N-K on 1 December 1989, an act against which Azerbaijan protested.

In the meantime the USSR was in the process of disintegration. Even before this was consummated, with the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on 21 December 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan attained their independence, on 23 and 30 August 1991, respectively. An agreement between them on 24 September to set their territorial dispute at rest proved to be stillborn.

Summary:

A crisis for Armenia was triggered on 27 November 1991 by Azerbaijan's abolition of the long-existing N-K Autonomous Oblast. When, in a referendum on 10 December, the population of N-K overwhelmingly voted for independence, a crisis was triggered for Azerbaijan. This choice was reaffirmed in elections in N-K on 28 December.

Rapid escalation of the crisis occurred: on 3 January 1992 Armenia's parliament supported the N-K demand for independence; Azerbaijan mobilized its armed forces; Armenia replied in kind; and military clashes occurred.

Several attempts at mediation followed in January-April 1992: by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) -- both Armenia and Azerbaijan had recently joined the CSCE â€“ which sent a mission to N-K on 12 February; by U.S. Secretary of State Baker, who visited both protagonists in February; by the UN Security Council, which passed two resolutions calling for a cease-fire by the conflicting parties; by Russia, which held peace talks in Moscow on 20 February; and by Turkey, Iran, and Czechoslovakia--all for naught. And, although Armenia declared on 3 March that it had no territorial claims against Azerbaijan and that the dispute over N-K was Azerbaijan's "internal affair," confrontation and military hostilities continued.

A further escalation point was a massive, successful attack by Armenia against the important town of Shusha on 8 May. Turkey, a patron of Azerbaijan, threatened Armenia on the 13th that it would intervene militarily if Shusha and Lachin were not restored to Azerbaijan. Russia responded by signing an agreement with Armenia on 15 May pledging military aid if its security were threatened. On the 20th Turkey reassured Russia that it would not intervene with force.

Azerbaijan launched a counteroffensive on 12 June. Because of its military successes, Armenia suspended its participation in the CSCE-sponsored peace talks in Rome, with the involvement of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Turkey, and the U.S. On 8 July Armenia rejected any formal link between N-K and Azerbaijan. On the 27th Azerbaijan accused Armenia of undermining its sovereignty. The N-K parliament accused Azerbaijan on 13 August of aggression, declared a six-month emergency, and ordered general mobilization. Although a finite end to the N-K crisis is not discernible, it can be viewed as fading from mid-August 1992 onward. The conflict over Nagornyy-Karabakh continues unresolved.

As noted, Russia was highly involved in this crisis. U.S. involvement was limited to its participation in the CSCE-sponsored Rome mediation effort. Many other states attempted to mediate the crisis and underlying conflict.
