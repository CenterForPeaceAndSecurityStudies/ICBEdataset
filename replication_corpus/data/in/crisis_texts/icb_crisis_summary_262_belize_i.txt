CRISNO 262

BELIZE I

Background:

The U.K. experienced a crisis from 1 to 30 November 1975 over Guatemala's threat to annex the British self-governing colony of Belize.

Background Belize was proclaimed a U.K. colony (British Honduras), closely linked to Jamaica, in 1862. It became a separate administrative unit in 1884, with British troops stationed in the area since 1948. Guatemala formally claimed the territory after World War II. A brief incident, an attempted incursion by two dozen members of the Belize Liberation Army, occurred in 1962.

Guatemala's claim to Belize and threats to annex the disputed territory once it became independent were discussed at the UN General Assembly for about 10 years prior to this crisis. The U.K. retained responsibility for the defense of Belize, but, in all other aspects, the colony was self-governing. In 1972 Guatemala threatened to invade Belize but the incident faded without violence.

Summary:

On 1 November 1975 the U.K. perceived a likely invasion of Belize following increased Guatemalan military activity--a movement of troops and patrol boats near the Belize border. The U.K. responded on 5 November with the dispatch of additional forces to strengthen the British garrison in Belize. A declaration by Guatemala that it intended to annex Belize was reported on the 7th. Talks were held during a visit by Edward Rowlands, U.K. Minister of State at the foreign office, to Guatemala and Belize. An agreement was reached on 30 November terminating the crisis: the two countries were to resume talks about the future of Belize in February 1976. Troops were subsequently withdrawn on both sides.

The UN Trusteeship Council contributed to crisis abatement by adopting a resolution on 20 November urging the resumption of negotiations between the U.K. and Guatemala. An earlier offer of UN arbitration had been rejected by Guatemala.

The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.

(Two years later a second U.K. crisis occurred over Belize [see Case #279].)
