CRISNO 240

CONAKRY RAID

Background:

A crisis for the Republic of Guinea took place from 22 November to 11 December 1970.

Background Guinean President Sekou Touré alleged Portuguese assassination attempts on his life during January and July 1964 and October 1970. Portugal accused the Republic of Guinea of harboring guerrillas wishing to oust Lisbon from the neighboring colonial territory of Portuguese Guinea (later Guinea-Bissau).

Summary:

On 22 November 1970, the trigger date, Radio Conakry of the Republic of Guinea announced an invasion by mercenaries from several sanctuaries, especially from the colonial territory of Portuguese Guinea. The same day, President Sekou Touré responded with force and appealed, on 22 and 23 November, for an emergency meeting of the Security Council and for troops from the United Nations and the OAU for "covert support."

The Security Council met from 22 to 24 November and called for the cessation of the attack and the withdrawal of the invading forces. It was decided to send a fact-finding commission to Guinea. The mission visited Guinea from 25 to 29 November. Its report, confirming the invasion of 350-400 men on 22 November and alleging support from an outside power, which seemed to be Portugal, was published on 4 December. The report also stated that the invasion was aimed at the overthrow of Sekou Touré, the freeing of Portuguese prisoners in the Republic of Guinea, and the weakening of the guerrilla forces who were active in Portuguese Guinea. Portugal rejected the UN report and denied participation in the invasion.

On 25 November Sekou Touré appealed to all friendly countries for military support. Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone offered to send troops. There were further incursions into Guinea by land on 27 November. Tanzania, Zambia, and the U.S. sent economic aid. Egypt sent arms and ammunition. Algeria and Libya were also reported to have sent military supplies. Political support for Guinea came from China, India, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and the Soviet Union. The Security Council passed a resolution on 8 December, the Western powers abstaining, warning Portugal against further attacks on African states, and called for immediate self-determination and independence for Portuguese Guinea. The termination date of the crisis was 11 December 1970, the day the Organization of African Unity (OAU) passed a unanimous resolution, initiated by Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, and Sudan, condemning Portugal and demanding reparations to Guinea. There was a subsequent tacit agreement to end the invasion.
