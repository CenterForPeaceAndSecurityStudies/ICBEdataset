CRISNO 243

CHAD-LIBYA I

Background:

The first of four Chad/Libya crises in the 1970s lasted from 24 May 1971 to 17 April 1972.

Summary:

In an attempt at Christian-Muslim reconciliation, half of the portfolios in the Chad government were granted to Muslim politicians on 24 May 1971. This act created a crisis for Libya by threatening its future influence in the domestic affairs of its southern neighbor. The pro-Libyan FROLINAT rejected the Chad government's offer.

On 27 August Libya responded by backing a coup against President Tombalbaye. Although it failed, the coup attempt triggered a crisis for Chad, which responded the same day by severing diplomatic relations with Libya. The perceived threat to its regime having been overcome, Chad's crisis ended the following day. On 17 September Libya recognized FROLINAT's claim to being the legitimate government of Chad. However, persistent pressure on Libya by France bore fruit: on 17 April 1972 Libya resumed relations with Chad, marking the end of this international crisis.

There were two efforts at mediation, both involving President Diori of Niger. The first occurred from 18 September to 24 November 1971, in which Diori visited both capitals but was ultimately unsuccessful in attenuating the tension between Chad and Libya. The second mediation attempt took place from 31 March to 12 April 1972. After delegations from both Libya and Chad traveled to Niger to meet under the auspices of Diori, both sides indicated that the mediation had been worthwhile in a joint statement of gratitude for Dioriâ€™s efforts on 12 April.

The UN, the U.S., the USSR, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
