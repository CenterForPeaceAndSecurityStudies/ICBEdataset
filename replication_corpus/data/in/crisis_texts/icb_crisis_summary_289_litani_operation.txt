CRISNO 289

LITANI OPERATION

Background:

An Israeli retaliatory invasion caused a crisis for Lebanon from 14 March to 13 June 1978.

Background and Pre-crisis PLO bases in Lebanon, supplied with Soviet weapons, had long been in operation as training camps for Palestinian guerrillas making frequent, mostly unsuccessful, incursions into Israeli territory. On 11 March 1978 11 Palestinians entered Israel by sea and attacked vehicles on the main highway 11 kilometers north of Tel Aviv. Thirty-five Israelis were killed and another 70 wounded before Israeli police, in a fierce clash, killed or captured all of the terrorists.

Summary:

Israeli troops, supported by the air force, crossed into southern Lebanon in a major attack against PLO bases, triggering a crisis for Lebanon on 14 March 1978. On the 17th Lebanon requested the Security Council to discuss the Israeli invasion. The Council met on the 19th and called for Israel's immediate withdrawal, along with the placement of a UN peacekeeping force in the area occupied by Israel. Lebanon's foreign minister met with ambassadors in Beirut to explain Lebanon's position. The hostilities ended at the end of March, but Israeli forces remained in Lebanon until 13 June 1978 when the last stage of the withdrawal was carried out. This terminated the crisis for Lebanon.

The Soviet Union and the United States were involved politically. Vice President Mondale acknowledged Israel's right to defend its borders against terrorist incursions but called for an Israeli withdrawal. The United States supported the Security Council resolution. The Soviet Union condemned the Israeli invasion and abstained in the Council vote. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), established in 1978, remained in southern Lebanon through the Lebanon War of 1982 and for years thereafter.
