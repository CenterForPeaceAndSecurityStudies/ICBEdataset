CRISNO 2

COSTA RICAN COUP

Background:

A two-stage crisis between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, arising from a military coup in the latter, lasted from 25 May 1918 until 3 September 1919.

PRE-CRISIS A military coup led by Federico Tinoco overthrew Costa Rica's president, Alfredo Gonzalez Flores, on 27 January 1917. U.S. policy, nonrecognition, and persistent opposition by supporters of the deposed president across the border in Nicaragua made it increasingly difficult for Tinoco to maintain control in Costa Rica.

Summary:

The movement of 500 Costa Rican troops to the Nicaraguan border on 25 May 1918, amid rumors of an imminent invasion of Costa Rica by pro-Gonzalez forces, triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. President Chamorro responded five days later by seeking U.S. advice and support and, in October, by attempting to forge a pact with Honduras designed to impose sanctions against Costa Rica and to assist Costa Rican rebels. On 4 November U.S. Secretary of State Lansing cautioned the presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras against supporting armed rebellion in Costa Rica. Nicaragua's crisis ended on 15 December 1918 when Chamorro informed its National Congress that Nicaragua was observing strict neutrality vis-à-vis Costa Rica.

Tension between the two Central American neighbors remained high due to continuing rumors of an anti-Tinoco invasion plan by rebel forces in Nicaragua, with aid from Honduras. President Tinoco communicated this perceived threat to the U.S. Consul--and chargé d'affaires--in Costa Rica, Chase, and to the American political leader, William Jennings Bryan, on 25 January 1919. This marked the onset of a crisis for Costa Rica.

Nicaragua accused Costa Rica of dispatching 5,000 troops to its border, a charge denied by Costa Rica's agent in Washington. On 30 April the U.S. minister in Nicaragua backed Nicaragua's charge in a report to Undersecretary of State Polk. Then on 6 May rebel forces under the command of Julio Acosta invaded Costa Rica and proclaimed a provisional government at Peña Blanca. Nicaragua denied Costa Rica's charge of direct involvement in the military hostilities and was backed by the U.S. Minister, Jefferson. But in June Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala recognized the Acosta regime. Despite his military victories, Tinoco fled Costa Rica on 12 August largely as a result of U.S. pressure. A new government formed by an associate of Tinoco collapsed on 3 September 1919, and the international crisis ended in Costa Rica's defeat.

The U.S. was highly involved throughout the crisis, mostly through political pressure on Tinoco to resign, but also more visibly through the landing of U.S. marines in Costa Rica in mid-June 1919, at the insistence of the U.S. consul and against the secretary of state's advice, to protect American citizens in Puerto Limón, Costa Rica. Honduras and Guatemala were also involved actors. (Acosta was elected President of Costa Rica on 9 December 1919, and his regime was accorded U.S. recognition in 1920.)

There was no global organization at the time of this crisis; and the Pan American Union, precursor to the Organization of American States (OAS), was not involved.
