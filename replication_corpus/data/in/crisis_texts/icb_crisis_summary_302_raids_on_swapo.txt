CRISNO 302

RAIDS ON SWAPO

Background:

South African raids on SWAPO bases in Angola caused a crisis for Angola from 6 to 28 March 1979.

Background and Pre-crisis SWAPO had carried on guerrilla warfare against South African troops in South-West Africa since 1966. In 1978 activity was intensified, and a crisis occurred from 3 to 17 May (see Case #291--Cassinga Incident). In November of that year Angola perceived the possibility of a South African invasion (see Case #297--Angola Invasion Scare). Guerrilla activity against South Africa reached its highest intensity in January 1979.

Summary:

On 6 March air and ground attacks by the SADF on SWAPO targets in southern Angola triggered a crisis for Angola. The attacks lasted until the 15th, the targets being mainly arms dumps and supplies. Some villages were attacked as well, and minor clashes were reported. Angola accused South Africa of using napalm, but there was no verification of this claim. On 16 March Angola approached the United Nations for help. The Security Council met between 20 and 28 March and passed a resolution on the 28th: it condemned South Africa and demanded an immediate end to provocative acts; it also called for "aid to strengthen the defensive capabilities" of Angola. The resolution ended the crisis for Angola's decision makers.

The United States abstained from the Security Council vote. The U.S. and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.

(Following the crisis, in April, President Neto announced to the Angolan people that he planned to increase the size of the armed forces. In October 1979 South African troops invaded Angola once more [see Case #308].)
