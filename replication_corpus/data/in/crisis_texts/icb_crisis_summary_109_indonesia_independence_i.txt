CRISNO 109

INDONESIA INDEPENDENCE I

Background:

The first of three crises over Indonesia's struggle for independence began on 29 September 1945 and terminated on 25 March 1947. The crisis actors were the Netherlands and Indonesia.

Summary:

A crisis for the Netherlands was triggered on 29 September 1945 when the Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia announced that his troops would maintain law and order in the Netherlands East Indies until a lawful government was again functioning, and that Indonesian leader Ahmad Sukarno was to continue to direct civil administration in those areas not occupied by Allied forces. This was regarded by the Netherlands as de facto recognition of the provisional Indonesian government and, therefore, a grave threat to its influence, long sustained by the Dutch empire. The Hague responded on 1 October with an official statement that the Netherlands would neither recognize nor negotiate with Sukarno.

Indonesia's crisis was triggered on 2 October by the arrival of a Dutch administrator and the landing of additional Dutch forces, interpreted by the Indonesians as a Dutch effort to restore colonial rule. Severe fighting ensued between nationalist and Dutch and British forces. On 13 October 1945 Indonesia responded with a declaration of war against the Netherlands and the prohibition of the sale of food to the enemy. The British were accused of promoting the return of the Dutch administration.

In an attempt to diffuse the situation, Britain began removing troops, and on 19 January 1946 sent Special Ambassador Archibald Clark Kerr (Lord Inverchapel) to assist in resolving the dispute. With Kerr present, mediation began on 10 February 1946 between Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir and Dr. Van Mook of the Netherlands. Kerr did not formulate proposals, but acted to moderate differences between the sides. However, talks stalled and met an impasse at Hoge Veluwe on 14 April.

The UK replaced Kerr with Lord Killearn in August, and on 7 October 1946, Killearn chaired talks that led to the Linggadjati negotiations. These negotiations ended on 15 November but were not signed until March of 1947. In late 1946 British forces were withdrawn. However, the fighting continued between the Dutch and nationalist forces, along with prolonged negotiations, until the signing of the Linggadjati Agreement on 25 March 1947, which provided for a transitional regime until 1 January 1949 at which time the Dutch government would transfer authority to an independent Republic of Indonesia. The agreement, which terminated the first international crisis over Indonesia's independence, provided for a truce and stabilization of existing military positions, the establishment of a Truce Supervisory Committee composed of Dutch, British, and Indonesian representatives, and the creation of the United States of Indonesia linked to the Netherlands.

The UN Security Council was involved because of a joint USSR-Ukrainian complaint on the issue of Dutch military intervention. Draft resolutions calling for on-the-spot investigation and limitation--and withdrawal--of British forces were rejected. The U.S. and the USSR were not active in this early post-World War II crisis, except for the latter's verbal support for Indonesia's nationalists at the UN and in general.
