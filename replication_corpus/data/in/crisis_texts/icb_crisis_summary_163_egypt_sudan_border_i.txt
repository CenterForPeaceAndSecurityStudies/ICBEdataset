CRISNO 163

EGYPT-SUDAN BORDER I

Background:

There was one crisis actor, Sudan. The crisis occurred between 9 and 25 February 1958.

Background Egypt claimed two areas lying north of the 22nd Parallel that had been administered by Sudan since 1902.

A plebiscite on the formation of the United Arab Republic (Egypt and Syria) was scheduled for 21 February. Forthcoming Sudanese elections were to be held six days later. On 1 February 1958 the Egyptian government sent a note to the Sudanese government charging Sudan with making arrangements for elections in areas north of the 1899 frontier.

Summary:

On 9 February 1958 a crisis was triggered for Sudan when it received reports that Egyptian army units were being sent to the disputed area. There were several strands to Sudan's response: a statement on 18 February in reply to an Egyptian Note received that day, declaring Sudan's determination to defend its sovereign territory; the dispatch of Sudanese troops to the area; a complaint to the UN Secretary-General; and a request for Arab League intervention on 20 February.

The Security Council met on 21 February but did not pass a resolution. However, Egypt, realizing that its case did not carry much weight, and after the Secretary-General of the Arab League consulted with Egypt, moved to settle the dispute expeditiously. On 25 February the Sudan government announced that the Egyptian flag had been taken down at Abu Ramada and that Egyptian forces had been removed. The crisis ended on 25 February without violence.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
