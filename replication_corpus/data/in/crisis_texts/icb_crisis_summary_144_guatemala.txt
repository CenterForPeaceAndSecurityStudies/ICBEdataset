CRISNO 144

GUATEMALA

Background:

Guatemala, the United States, and Honduras were engaged in a crisis with a pronounced Cold War dimension from 12 December 1953 until 29 June 1954.

Background Agrarian reform and foreign investment control were instituted in Guatemala in 1951, with growing influence of the Communist Party. The U.S. perceived this development as a threat to its influence in Latin America.

Summary:

The Guatemala crisis was triggered on 12 December 1953 when Guatemala's government received information concerning a U.S. decision to support an antigovernment "liberation" movement. The following month Guatemala responded with a decision to obtain arms from the Soviet bloc in order to arm a workers' militia. This information, confirmed to the U.S. on 10 February 1954, triggered a crisis for the U.S. Soviet arms began reaching Guatemala on 15 May and were viewed by the U.S. as a grave development. On 18 May Honduras, in the midst of a general strike causing substantial damage to its economy, perceived Guatemalan infiltration, along with rumors about arms reaching Honduran strikers via Guatemala, as a threat. Honduras responded on 25 May by recalling its ambassador to Guatemala.

After unsuccessful efforts by the U.S. to resolve the situation through conferences, negotiations, and promises to review Latin American economic problems, its major response occurred on 18 June when the U.S. proclaimed a complete embargo on arms shipments to Guatemala and backed an invasion led by Castillo Armas against the Arbenz government, then in power in Guatemala. Guatemala appealed to the Security Council and the Inter-American Peace Committee the next day for assistance, accusing Honduras (and Nicaragua) of aggression. On the 20th, the Soviets vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for no UN intervention until an investigation had been completed by the Organization of American States (OAS). When the Guatemalan army refused to engage the Armas forces, Arbenz resigned, on 27 June. After an interim Diaz-led military junta stayed in control for two days, a new junta, led by Colonel Morz√≥n, was set up on 29 June 1954 and suppressed the "Arbencista" political elite. This marked the termination date for all three crisis actors.

(The U.S.'s CIA-initiated Guatemala crisis and the overthrow of the Arbenz regime led to the longest internal war in Latin America's history. It began in 1961 and led to the death of more than 100,000--some estimates are as high as 200,000. After 35 years of civil strife, the armed forces and left-wing guerrillas signed a peace accord on 19 September 1996. This was the fifth major pact brokered by the U.N. since January 1994: the others dealt with human rights, poverty, land tenure, and war crimes. The military accord provided for a substantial reduction in the size, budget, and power of the armed forces, including the creation of a new, civilian-directed police force to take over the army's long-standing control over internal security.)

(In December 1996 the Guatemalan Government and the left-wing guerrilla coalition terminated their struggle with three pacts: a "definitive cease-fire"; an agreement on constitutional reforms and electoral procedures; and the process for reintegrating the guerrillas into Guatemalan society. The overarching peace accord was signed in Guatemala City on 29 December 1996.)
