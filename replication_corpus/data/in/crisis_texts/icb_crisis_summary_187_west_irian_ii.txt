CRISNO 187

WEST IRIAN II

Background:

Indonesia and the Netherlands experienced a second crisis over this territorial residue of the struggle for independence. It began on 26 September 1961 and ended on 15 August 1962.

Pre-crisis Following an Indonesian decision to "liberate" West Irian, President Sukarno appealed to the USSR for political and military support, which was granted. A new Dutch plan was designed stressing the idea of self-determination for the Papuans.

Summary:

A crisis for Indonesia began on 26 September 1961 when the Dutch foreign minister submitted a proposal to the UN for the decolonization of West Irian and the transfer of sovereignty to its people, with the UN assuming its administration temporarily. Indonesia, which viewed the proposal as a means of consolidating Dutch administration and thus keeping Indonesia out of West Irian indefinitely, responded on 19 December 1961 by inaugurating a triple command for the "liberation" of New Guinea, along with general mobilization. In order to focus world attention, a small-scale infiltration into West Irian was initiated. This triggered a crisis for the Netherlands.

Active participation by the UN Secretary-General and an announcement by President Kennedy of the U.S.'s intention to seek a solution persuaded the Netherlands to respond on 3 January 1962: it announced its decision of the previous day to drop the demand that Indonesia accept the principle of self-determination for the Papuans as a condition for negotiations. Once the U.S. had abandoned its neutral position for a policy of active mediation, a solution—brokered by U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, acting as the UN Secretary-General's personal representative--became possible. Bunker’s mediation efforts began with discussions with Dutch and Indonesian representatives on 20 March, near Washington, D.C. The next few months saw the negotiations proceed with initial success and then stall. Bunker played an important role in proposing possible agreements and keeping the parties negotiating. Largely as a result of Bunker’s persistent mediation, Indonesia and the Netherlands finally reached an agreement on 15 August 1962, the termination date of the crisis. Under the terms of the agreement, the UN would supervise the evacuation of Dutch military forces and take over administration of the area until it was handed over to Indonesia no later than 1 May 1963.

The USSR was only peripherally involved, as it supplied arms to Indonesia.
