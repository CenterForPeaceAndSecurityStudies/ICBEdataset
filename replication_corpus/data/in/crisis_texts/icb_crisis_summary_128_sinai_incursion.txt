CRISNO 128

SINAI INCURSION

Background:

An intra-war crisis for Egypt, the U.K., and Israel occurred during the first Arab/Israel War and lasted from 25 December 1948 to 10 January 1949.

Background The first of many Arab/Israel wars had begun on 15 May 1948 (see Case #120), with the end of the British Mandate, Israel's proclamation of independence, and the invasion by five Arab states. Egypt's refusal to negotiate an armistice agreement led Israel to increase its efforts to conquer southern territory.

Summary:

On 25 December 1948 Israeli forces launched an attack on the Egyptian army in the south, crossing into the Egyptian-held Sinai peninsula and triggering crises for Egypt and Britain. After an unsuccessful attempt to rally Arab League states to its aid, Egypt responded to this territorial threat on 31 December by appealing to the U.K. to press for a Security Council resolution demanding Israeli withdrawal. Britain, relying on its unrenewed 1936 treaty with Egypt, triggered a crisis for Israel by sending an ultimatum, via the U.S. embassy, on the 31st, demanding the evacuation of Egyptian territory no later than 8 January 1949. Israel responded to this threat of military intervention by changing the direction of its forces while still remaining in Sinai. The crisis was escalated further when Israel shot down five British planes over Israeli territory that had been sent to observe the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Britain reacted strongly by sending military reinforcements to its base in Aqaba, Jordan, on 7 January. That day Israel ordered its troops out of the area, in response to a Security Council call for a cease-fire. This withdrawal was completed by 10 January 1949, the termination date for all three crisis actors.

The U.S. was highly involved politically: it pressed Israel to comply with the U.K. demand. The USSR was aloof from this crisis.
