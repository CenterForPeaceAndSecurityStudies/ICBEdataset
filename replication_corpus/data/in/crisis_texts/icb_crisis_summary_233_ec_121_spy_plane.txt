CRISNO 233

EC-121 SPY PLANE

Background:

The United States experienced a crisis with North Korea from 15 to 26 April 1969 over the shooting down of a U.S. reconnaissance plane.

Background The U.S. and North Korea had fought a bitter and costly war from 1950 to 1953 (see Cases #132, #133, #140--Korean War I, II, III, in Korea PC). Fifteen years later, they experienced another crisis, arising from North Korea's seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo and the capture of its crew in what the U.S. claimed was international waters (see Case #224--Pueblo, in Korea PC): that crisis began on 22 January 1968 but dragged on until December, less than four months before the outbreak of a new crisis between the two long-time adversaries.

Summary:

On 15 April 1969 a U.S. navy EC-121 reconnaissance plane with 31 men aboard was shot down by a North Korean aircraft over the Sea of Japan. In a radio broadcast North Korea claimed that the plane was flying deep into its territorial airspace. The U.S. countered with a statement that the plane had never left international airspace and responded with the dispatch into the Sea of Japan of Task Force 7--29 ships, including four aircraft carriers. In Washington, an ad hoc group of the National Security Council was formed to recommend to the president alternative ways to deal with the crisis. (This group was the beginning of the Washington Special Action Group [WSAG], organized by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to assist in crisis management.)

The options presented to President Nixon ranged from diplomatic protests to strong military retaliation, for U.S. credibility and its influence as a superpower were perceived to be at stake. President Nixon ordered the resumption of reconnaissance flights accompanied by armed escorts, and the redisposition of the strong U.S. naval force into the Sea of Japan. The Soviet Union became involved early in the crisis when the Nixon administration requested Moscow's assistance, along with that of Japan and South Korea, in the search for the plane and its missing crewmen. On 22 April the USSR issued a mild protest against U.S. activity in the Sea of Japan. The crisis ended on 26 April when the U.S. naval task force was moved from the Sea of Japan into the Yellow Sea, after no further incidents occurred.

The UN remained aloof during this crisis.
