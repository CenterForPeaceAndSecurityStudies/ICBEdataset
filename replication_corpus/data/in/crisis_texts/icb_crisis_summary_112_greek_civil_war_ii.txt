CRISNO 112

GREEK CIVIL WAR II

Background:

Greece experienced an international crisis during its lengthy civil war; the crisis began on 13 November 1946 and ended on 28 February 1947.

Background A Communist attempt to seize power in Greece in December 1944 was crushed by British forces. Many of the guerrillas escaped to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Bulgaria, all of which provided sanctuary and military support (see Case #98--Greek Civil War I, in Europe: Non-PCs). The civil war continued in the north of Greece with few lulls in the fighting.

Summary:

On 13 November 1946 a major attack was launched by Greek guerrillas at Skra. The seriousness of the situation triggered a crisis for Greece, which feared the possible effect on its political system. Aid to the Greek Communist rebels by the Communist regime in Yugoslavia made that country Greece's principal adversary.

A full-scale military operation against the rebels was launched by the Greek army on 18 November. On 3 December Greece also responded with an appeal to the United Nations Security Council. UN activity took the form of a fact-finding mission in January 1947 authorized by the Security Council. (An earlier Security Council discussion [Jan. 1946] on British forces in Greece ended without any UN action.) The mission found that infiltration across Greece's frontiers was indeed taking place. The crisis may be said to have ended on 28 February 1947, the day the U.S. government invited Greek officials to draft a letter asking for aid. Two weeks later President Truman requested Congress to provide economic and military assistance to the Athens regime (see Case #114).

The outcome of this specific crisis was a compromise because the conflict continued for more than two years after the termination of Greece's crisis with neighboring states aiding Greek Communist guerrillas. The Greek civil war ended on 10 July 1949 when Tito announced the closing of Yugoslavia's border to Greek guerrillas. One month later the Greek army launched an offensive and, within two weeks, the guerrillas were crushed. Prior to Tito's action the army had been unable to suppress the Greek communists, despite its military superiority.
