CRISNO 322

ECUADOR-PERU BORDER III

Background:

Ecuador and Peru experienced another violent crisis over their long-disputed border from 22 January to 2 April 1981.

Background As noted, there were several incidents and two international crises over the disputed territory, in 1935 and 1941-42 (see Cases #50 and #86). The two disputants had signed the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro on 29 January 1942, which allocated the territory to Peru but gave Ecuador navigation rights on the Amazon River; it also called for demarcation of the border.

Demarcation work was suspended in August 1951, following Peruvian attacks on Ecuadorian posts in the disputed Gualingo area. In 1960 Ecuador declared the Rio Protocol null and void, asserting that it had signed under duress. Border incidents continued, the latest in 1978, a minor clash at a border post near Qualquiza, in Peru.

Summary:

The catalyst was a minor clash on 22 January 1981. Ecuador viewed the trigger as an attack by a Peruvian helicopter on a military outpost near Paquisha. Peru countered that its plane had been fired on by Ecuadorian forces while en route to Peruvian border posts with supplies. On 28 January skirmishes erupted, each side accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Peruvian forces occupied three Ecuadorian border posts. The two disputants closed their border, mobilized their forces, and suspended commercial flights.

At that point in the escalating crisis the OAS initiated mediation. On 29 January its Permanent Council called on Ecuador and Peru to accept a commission of inquiry. Ecuador agreed; but Peru balked, contending that the four guarantors of the 1942 Rio Protocol--Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the U.S.--should be directly involved in any settlement. Peru also declined offers of mediation from the Colombian and Venezuelan presidents. The OAS Council also approved, by a vote of 20-0, an Ecuadorian request for an OAS foreign ministers meeting.

Per Peruâ€™s request, the four guarantors of the Rio Protocol served as mediators in the conflict, and they met on 31 January and arranged a cease-fire. Hostilities ended on 1 February, and the cease-fire took effect the next day. However, while tension and stress declined, the crisis lingered. On 20 February a Peruvian helicopter was attacked by Ecuadorian forces. Both states again sealed their borders on the 23rd. The four guarantors once more mediated, with a proposal for mutual withdrawal of troops behind a nine-mile zone. The parties agreed, withdrawing their troops by 17 March. The border was reopened on 2 April, marking the end of this Ecuador/Peru border crisis.

The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
