CRISNO 318

LIBYA INTERVENTION IN THE GAMBIA

Background:

The Gambia experienced a crisis from 27 October to 7 November 1980 as a result of alleged Libyan involvement in an attempted coup.

Background and Pre-crisis The Gambia's relations with Libya deteriorated in 1979. Most visibly, its government nationalized a transport company jointly owned with Libya, following Tripoli's apparent failure to honor promises of economic aid. Most important was alleged Libyan involvement in internal attempts to overthrow The Gambia's government. A formal protest was sent to Libya in March 1980.

In a related incident, Senegal, The Gambia's long-time protector--de facto since the latter's independence in 1965, formally since their mutual defense agreement in 1976--severed diplomatic relations with Libya on 14 July 1980: President Senghor accused Libya of training a mercenary army and attempting to destabilize the governments of Chad, Mali, Niger, and Senegal in order to assert Libya's dominance over equatorial Africa.

Apart from The Gambia and Senegal, several of Libya's neighbors saw its "long arm" in attempts to overthrow their regimes, as in Chad since 1978 (see Cases #288, #290, #304--Chad/Libya II, III, IV, in Chad/Libya PC), and in Tunisia (see Case #311--Raid on Gafsa).

Summary:

A crisis for The Gambia was triggered on 27 October 1980 by the murder of the deputy commander of its paramilitary Field Force. While the government later attempted to dispel rumors that this had been part of an attempted coup, Libya's embassy was closed and its staff expelled on 29 October.

The Gambia accused Libya of attempting to use its money and power to destabilize Gambian society. Specifically, Libya's diplomatic mission in the Gambian capital, Banjul, was accused of providing financial aid and training to two opposition groups in The Gambia, the Movement for Justice in Africa (MOJA-Gambia) and the Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party (GSRP), seeking to spread confusion and disorder in The Gambia. On 30 October these radical groups were banned. On the 31st 150 Senegalese troops flew into Banjul at the request of The Gambia's long-time leader, Sir Dawda Jawara--he held power from 1965 to 1994--to take part in a previously scheduled joint training exercise under the terms of their defense agreement. These troops took up positions around the State House, around The Gambia's Field Force barracks at Bakai, and at Yundum airport.

Stress among The Gambia's decision makers declined in the succeeding days. The Senegalese troops remained in The Gambia for a week. Their departure on 7 November marked the end of the crisis.

There was no UN or regional organization involvement or superpower activity in this crisis.

(Eight months later, Senegalese troops again successfully defended the Jawara regime against an internal revolt [see Case #329].)
