CRISNO 149

GAZA RAID-CZECHOSLOVKIA ARMS

Background:

The crisis between Egypt and Israel began on 28 February 1955 and ended on 23 June 1956.

Background During the early 1950s Israel suffered from repeated terrorist attacks by infiltration into Israeli territory, particularly from Gaza, which was then controlled by Egypt. Five reprisal raids into Egyptian territory were carried out by Israel from 1950 to 1955.

Summary:

Israel's retaliatory raid into Gaza on 28 February 1955, in which 39 Arabs were killed and 32 injured, triggered a crisis for Egypt. On 20 March Egypt appealed to the UN Security Council and the Arab League. Its major response, on 20 April, was a request by Nasir to Zhou Enlai to contact Moscow about supplying arms to Egypt. The crisis ended for Egypt on 28 September 1955 when, with Soviet approval, an arms agreement was signed with Czechoslovakia.

This marked the trigger for Israel's crisis. By 11 December 1955, when an agreement between France and Israel for the purchase of French Mystères was signed, Israel had answered cumulative terrorist attacks by four more raids into Egyptian territory. On 5 April 1956 a large raid into Gaza resulted in 59 deaths and 93 wounded. However, Israel's major response was a letter to the prime minister of France on 12 April 1956 requesting massive amounts of arms. Another agreement was signed for six more French Mystères on 23 April. The termination date for Israel's crisis was 23 June 1956 when a third arms deal was signed with France that would provide substantial French arms to Israel, and enable Israeli decision makers to correct the imbalance in military capability that had occurred as a result of the Czech. arms agreement with Egypt and Syria.

The Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel for the Gaza Raid. The Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, arrived in Jerusalem on 10 April 1956 to mediate in the crisis via shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem, Cairo and Amman. On 19 April, Hammarskjold secured a cease-fire between Israel and Egypt, but the cease-fire only lasted 10 days. Unable to implement another cease-fire, the Secretary-General left the region and was ultimately ineffective in bringing about crisis abatement. The Arab League held discussions but did not pass any resolution.

The U.S. was politically involved in this crisis. The Soviet Union provided military aid to Egypt.
