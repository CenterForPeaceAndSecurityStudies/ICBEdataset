CRISNO 131

SOVIET BLOC-YUGOSLAVIA

Background:

A prolonged crisis for Yugoslavia began on 19 August 1949 and faded in November 1951.

Background Relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia began deteriorating soon after World War II. In January 1948 the Soviet Union communicated its displeasure with what it perceived as Yugoslavia's increasingly independent domestic and foreign policy. In the next few months there were further Russian charges and Yugoslav denials of disloyalty to international communism. In the summer of 1948 Yugoslavia was expelled from the Soviet-dominated Communist Information Bureau (COMINFORM).

Summary:

On 19 August 1949 the Yugoslav government received an ultimatum from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that was perceived as a possible prelude to a military invasion; there was, in fact, a show of force by the Soviet division in Yugoslavia, but Moscow acted so as to avoid involvement in military hostilities against Tito's regime. Yugoslavia responded the same day by placing its forces on alert and conducting military maneuvers along the border. The crisis gradually faded.

In November 1951 Yugoslavia lodged a formal complaint with the UN against the "hostile actions" by the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies. The General Assembly passed a resolution noting Yugoslavia's readiness to seek a peaceful solution. U.S. involvement consisted of economic aid to Yugoslavia. Sanctions by the COMINFORM were imposed on Yugoslavia and, later, by the Soviet bloc's economic organization, COMECON. This crisis led to a basic shift in Yugoslavia's foreign policy orientation and marked a precedent for a Soviet doctrine of the right of intervention, what became known as the "Brezhnev Doctrine" almost two decades later (see Case #227--Prague Spring).
