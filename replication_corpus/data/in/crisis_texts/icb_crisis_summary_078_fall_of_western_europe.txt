CRISNO 78

FALL OF WESTERN EUROPE

Background:

The crisis over Germany's occupation of Western Europe occurred from 10 May to 22 June 1940. Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, and France were the crisis actors.

Pre-crisis On 9 April 1940 German armed forces occupied Denmark and invaded Norway (see Case #77).

Summary:

Early in the morning of 10 May 1940 German armies, without warning, invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, triggering a crisis for those three countries and for France and Britain. The latter were cobelligerent partners in the ongoing European war; the cornerstone of Britain's defense policy had always been that a threat to France was perceived in London as a threat to itself. Thus, on 10 May, they responded by dispatching expeditionary forces into Belgium to cooperate with the Belgian army in its resistance. Diplomatic negotiations were also carried on. Belgium and the Netherlands responded on the 10th as well with military resistance. In Luxembourg there was no fighting.

The royal family retired to its castle, refusing to communicate with the German invaders, and its crisis ended on the day of the invasion. In Holland, Rotterdam surrendered to the Germans after a fierce air attack, and the government, headed by Queen Wilhelmina, escaped to London on 13 May. Holland signed an armistice agreement with the Germans on 15 May 1940.

Between 17 and 21 May German mechanized divisions drove deep into northern France and succeeded in separating British and Belgian forces in Flanders from the main French armies. The fall of Brussels forced the British and Belgian troops back to Ostend and Dunkirk. On 26 May Boulogne fell to the Germans, and King Leopold ordered his army to capitulate. This was done on 28 May, terminating the crisis for Belgium. Two hundred and fifty thousand British troops were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk.

A broad attack on France was launched on 5 June. On the l0th Italy declared war against France and Britain. Paris was evacuated on the l3th. And on 17 June the U.K. crisis ended when it formally withdrew its troops from France and agreed to the latter's making a separate peace with the Germans. On that day Marshal Petain asked the Germans for an armistice. This was signed on 22 June 1940 ending the crisis for France and leaving three-fifths of the country under German occupation.

An immediate legacy of this intrawar crisis was a near confrontation between Britain and Vichy France as a result of the former's fear that the French fleet concentrated in Toulon would be handed over to Germany. The British signaled their determination to prevent this by sinking the French naval flotilla in Oran, North Africa, on 3 July 1940. The U.K. remained suspicious of Petain's intentions throughout the tenure of the Vichy French regime, as evident in the Mid-East Campaign crisis of 1941 (see Case #84).
