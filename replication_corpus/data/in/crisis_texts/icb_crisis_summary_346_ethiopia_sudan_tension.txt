CRISNO 346

ETHIOPIA-SUDAN TENSION

Background:

Sudan perceived a crisis with Ethiopia from 20 November 1983 to 20 February 1984.

Background and Pre-crisis A protracted civil war between the Muslim-led government in the north and predominantly Christian forces in the south had created havoc and made Sudan vulnerable to external intervention. The internal situation deteriorated in May 1983 following Khartoum's attempts to weaken the south, through an imposed administrative division of the south into three zones and the rotation of southern army units to the north, along with the exploitation of newly discovered oil in the south for the benefit of the north. The result was mutiny in the army and mass desertions of southern soldiers, and a sharpening of civil strife.

In September 1983 President Numeiri accused Ethiopia, Iran, Libya, and the USSR of plotting against his regime. On 15 November 11 foreign workers and 18 Sudanese were kidnapped by rebel forces based in Ethiopia. Two days later Sudan claimed that these rebel forces had attacked southern Sudan.

Summary:

The crisis trigger for Sudan was an alleged massing of 1,000 Ethiopian troops on its border, supported by 150 Cuban and Soviet advisors, financed by Libya. This "foreign conspiracy" was denounced on 20 November by Sudan's First Vice-President, General Omar Mohamed Al-Taib. The same day Sudan proclaimed a state of emergency and placed its armed forces on a state of maximum alert. In a delayed reaction, President Mengistu of Ethiopia denied Sudan's allegations on 24 January 1984, as did Ethiopia's foreign minister in Paris, claiming that the situation on the border was "very calm."

Sudan claimed on 19 December that its forces had broken the siege of Nasir, about 30 kilometers from the border. Tension and low-intensity conflict persisted until 20 February when Sudan's foreign minister announced unilateral steps to end its hostile verbal campaign against Ethiopia as a goodwill gesture. This marked the termination of Sudan's crisis with its neighbor.

The U.S., the UN, and the OAU were not involved. The USSR, as noted, was accused by Sudan of a "Kremlin plan" to undermine Sudan's territorial integrity and political stability.
