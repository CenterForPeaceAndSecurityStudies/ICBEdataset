CRISNO 373

TODGHERE INCIDENT

Background:

Somalia experienced another crisis with Ethiopia from 12 February until early April 1987.

Background Low-intensity violence between these long-standing adversaries continued unabated through the 1980s, for the most part indirectly: the protagonists acted through ethnic, paramilitary, proxy organizations--the Ethiopian-backed Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) and the Somali National Movement (SNM), against the Somalia-supported Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF). Somalia persistently claimed jurisdiction over Somalis living in the Ogaden Desert. Ethiopia persistently rejected the Somali claim. Occasionally border incidents escalated to an interstate crisis. One of these occurred in 1987.

Summary:

A crisis for Somalia was triggered on 12 February 1987 when Ethiopia-backed SNM irregulars penetrated 20 kilometers beyond the border and attacked six Somali villages in Todghere Province. Somalia repulsed the attack, reportedly within hours, each side suffering about 25 casualties in the incident. On 17 February Ethiopia indirectly acknowledged responsibility by announcing that an official inquiry would be held to determine the cause of the incident. Addis Ababa also reaffirmed its interest in achieving a peace accord with its neighbor. Lesser incidents occurred during the next six weeks. An interim cease-fire agreement was reached in Mogadishu in early April, terminating the crisis.

(A year later, on 3 April 1988, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to demilitarize their border and to restore diplomatic relations.)

The U.S., the USSR, the UN, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
