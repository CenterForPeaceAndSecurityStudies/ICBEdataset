CRISNO 251

LIBYAN PLANE

Background:

The appearance of a Libyan plane over Israeli-occupied territory created a 30-minute crisis for Israel on 21 February 1973.

Background Several weeks prior to this event, Israel's cabinet had been alerted to a terrorist plot to hijack an airliner which would be packed with explosives and crashed into an Israeli population center.

Summary:

On 21 February 1973 a plane was spotted on Israeli radar heading in the direction of Israel's nuclear plant in Dimona. Apparently a Libyan Boeing-727 with 113 passengers on board had strayed over the eastern side of the Suez Canal, then occupied by Israel. Israeli fighter planes immediately intercepted the intruding aircraft, demanding identification. Twenty minutes of sustained warnings and signals to the pilot brought no results. Orders were requested from higher military officers. The Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General David Elazar, ordered the air force to shoot down the plane. Israeli pilots responded by so doing. When the plane crashed, 30 minutes after it had been spotted, the crisis for Israel was terminated.

Immediately thereafter the Israelis learned that the plane had been a civilian airliner from Libya and that it had not represented a security threat. There were very few survivors. Most of the passengers were Egyptian, some German. The pilot was French. Israel subsequently paid compensation to the families of the dead. Following the crisis Israel was condemned by most members of the international system. France conducted a separate investigation. There was no UN or superpower activity during the crisis because of its brevity.
