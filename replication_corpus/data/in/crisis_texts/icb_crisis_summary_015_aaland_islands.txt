CRISNO 15

AALAND ISLANDS

Background:

Sweden and Finland experienced a crisis over the Aaland Islands from 5 June 1920 until 20 October 1921.

Background For more than a century the grand duchy of Finland, including the Aaland Islands, had been an integral part of the czarist empire: it had been ceded to Russia by Sweden in 1809.

On 6 December 1917, a month after the Bolshevik revolution, Finland declared its independence, an act recognized by Russia, France, Germany, and Sweden in January 1918. However, on 29 December 1917 the residents of the Aaland Islands had asserted a right to self-determination and voted to join Sweden. On 2 March 1918, a day before the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and Russia that recognized the independence of Finland, among many other czarist Russia possessions, Germany occupied the Aaland Islands at the request of Finland. German forces remained in Finland until late December 1918. On 1 June 1919 the islanders called for a plebiscite over the issue of joining Sweden. The issue remained dormant for almost a year.

Pre-crisis On 7 May 1920 Finland's Diet (legislature) granted local autonomy to the Aaland Islands but ruled out secession. Tension rose at the beginning of June with the arrests of two islanders by Finland on a charge of treason.

Summary:

A formal Swedish protest was ignored, and Finland dispatched troops to the Aalands around 5 June. This precipitated a crisis for Sweden, which perceived that a direct military threat could be mounted from the islands. Some Swedes urged the use of force. Sweden responded on the 15th by recalling its minister to Helsinki and appealing to the League of Nations. This dual response, especially the latter act, catalyzed a crisis for Finland, which perceived a threat to territorial integrity and sovereignty over the Aalands.

On 11 July 1920 the U.K. brought the dispute between Sweden and Finland before the League Council under Article 11 of the Covenant. Finland, which was not then a League member, rejected the Council's competence. The next day the Council sought a decision by a committee of three jurists as to whether or not the League had the right to intervene in the dispute. On the basis of the committeeâ€™s affirmative ruling on 5 September the Council dispatched a neutral commission of inquiry to the Baltic, which deliberated from November 1920 to February 1921.

Acting on the findings of the commission the League Council, on 24 June 1921, confirmed Finland's sovereignty over the islands, with the requirement that they be demilitarized and given autonomy. Finland and Sweden accepted the recommendations on 27 June and agreed on guarantees for residents of the islands. The agreement, along with demilitarization and neutralization, was formalized on 20 October 1921 by a convention signed by many involved actors: Baltic states Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden; major powers France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K.; and Poland. That formal act terminated the Aaland Islands crisis.

(In 1935 Finland, with the support of Sweden, both of which were concerned with growing insecurity in the Baltic, began to plan the refortification of the Aaland Islands. At the last session of the League of Nations Council in 1938-39 they sought Council approval. All the signatories to the 1921 convention had approved the plan, but the USSR, a nonsignatory, balked and persuaded the Council not to pass a resolution on the matter.)
