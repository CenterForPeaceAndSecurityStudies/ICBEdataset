CRISNO 231

USSURI RIVER

Background:

There were many border incidents between the Soviet Union and China from the late 1950s onward. One reached crisis proportions, at the Ussuri River from 2 March to 20 October 1969.

Background and Pre-crisis The ideological rivalry between the PRC and the USSR surfaced with Khrushchev's accession to power in the Soviet Union in 1955. His "de-Stalinization" speech at the 1956 Soviet Communist Party Congress exacerbated the rift. And an open split between Maoist China and post-Stalinist Russia crystallized at the conference of world Communist parties in 1960. Border talks in 1964 were unilaterally suspended by China. In 1965 the USSR initiated a military buildup along China's borders. The impact of China's traumatic Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s was still fresh. There had been large population transfers from urban to rural areas in China. The Prague Spring crisis had terminated with a Soviet-bloc invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 (see Case #227, in Europe: Non-PCs). And by 1969 Soviet preoccupation with Berlin had subsided, allowing Moscow to concentrate on China.

For several years before the 1969 crisis there had been clashes along the Sino/Soviet border, notably in January, on 7-9 and 23 December 1967, and in late January 1968. On 16 February 1969 the Chinese became aware that Soviet forces along the Ussuri River had been placed on the highest alert.

Summary:

A foreign policy crisis for the USSR, as distinct from an incident, was initiated by a Chinese ambush of Soviet troops on 2 March 1969. Moscow's response, which triggered a crisis for China, was a massive attack on 15 March against Chinese forces stationed along the Ussuri River. China responded militarily the day of the attack. There were considerable casualties on both sides. Tension continued along the border, but there were no further military hostilities.

Following the clashes there were mass demonstrations in Beijing and in Moscow. On 29 March the USSR issued the first of a series of moderate diplomatic notes urging China to negotiate. A joint Sino/Soviet Commission to regulate navigation on border rivers reconvened on 11 May and reached agreement on 8 August 1969. At the same time, clashes continued--on 16, 17, and 25 April, 2, 12-15, 20, 25, and 28 May, 10-11 June, 8 and 20 July, and 13 August. That day, too, the Soviets threatened to bomb China's nuclear facilities situated several thousand miles away in the remote province of Sinkiang. Beijing then agreed to negotiate on the larger border problems between the two countries.

After the Sinkiang threat, a brief meeting took place on 11 September between Premiers Kosygin and Zhou Enlai. Negotiations on Sino/Soviet border disputes began on 20 October, marking the termination date for both crisis actors. The talks proved to be inconclusive. But while the conflict continued, the polemics had been considerably toned down.

(There were several minor border incidents in subsequent years, notably in 1978.) U.S. activity was limited to political statements. The Warsaw Treaty Organization met, but it had no effect on abating the crisis. The UN remained aloof.
