CRISNO 390

GALTAT ZEMMOUR II

Background:

Morocco experienced another crisis with Polisario from 7 October to late November 1989.

Background Although clashes erupted in January and August 1988, there was a marked shift toward diplomacy and accommodation that year. On 30 August Morocco and Polisario agreed to a UN-OAU peace plan aimed at ending their 13-year-old conflict for control of Western (former Spanish) Sahara. The plan called for a cease-fire and a referendum on self-determination among the people of the territory. This breakthrough was followed by the first meeting between senior officials of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with King Hassan of Morocco, on 4 January 1989 in Marrakesh.

The embryonic peace process was assisted by another basic change: on 16 May 1988 diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco were restored after a break of 12 years. Since Algeria had been the main source of military and political support for Polisario since 1975, this, too, augured well for a resolution of the conflict. The process was further reinforced on 17 February 1989 when, at a two-day summit of North African heads of state in Marrakesh, an Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) was proclaimed by Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. Moreover, on 14 May the Algerian and Moroccan foreign ministers ratified a long-moribund agreement (signed in 1972) that settled their border dispute (see Case #199--Algeria/Morocco Border, in 1963, in Africa: Non-PCs). And on 5 August they signed a border and cooperation agreement.

In that atmosphere of peace-seeking, Polisario was compelled to restrain its military activity. However, when no significant progress was made in negotiations with Morocco since the meeting of January 1989, Polisario reverted to the path of violence. It began with a small-scale attack on 24 September in which four Moroccan soldiers were killed. This was followed by serious clashes in October-November, which threatened the agreements of the preceding year.

Summary:

On 7 October 1989 the Polisario Front broke the truce with an attack on Moroccan positions at Galtat Zemmour, its first major offensive since September 1988. This triggered a fresh crisis for Morocco. Another major attack occurred four days later. And despite the reconciliation between Morocco and Algeria in May 1988, Algeria continued to provide diplomatic support to Polisario. Thus the renewed fighting also posed a danger to the incipient accommodation between Algeria and Morocco.

Tension rose on the 9th when Morocco threatened military intervention in Mauritania if Polisario attacks from its territory continued. Four days later King Hassan declared that the Moroccan people had decided to fight "another 100 years if necessary" to defend its territory and sovereignty.

On 13 October UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar issued a report on the Western Sahara conflict, expressing the hope that further meetings between King Hassan and Polisario would take place, as the UN-OAU peace plan could only succeed if the two sides held direct negotiations.

On 7 November the SADR called for a dialogue with Morocco in order to achieve peace in Western Sahara. However, the next day Polisario launched a third massive attack against Moroccan forces at Amgala. And further clashes erupted on the 16th. Serious fighting ended in the second half of November 1989; and the crisis faded.

Because of the scale of Polisario attacks, Morocco suspected complicity by the Algerian military. Nonetheless the economic cooperation between Algeria and Morocco was sustained.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.

(Following a request by the UN Secretary-General, Polisario agreed to a truce on 21 February 1990 until the end of March, in order to create a positive atmosphere for UN peace efforts in the region.)

(A UN-brokered cease-fire in 1991 between Morocco and Polisario continues to hold with few violations. The agreement created a peacekeeping force, initially with 320 peacekeepers. And the parties agreed to a UN-supervised referendum, with two options for the tiny population of Western Sahara, 72,000 according to the last Spanish census in 1974: they could vote for integration into Morocco or for independence. Scheduled for January 1992, the referendum was repeatedly postponed.)
