CRISNO 126

COSTA RICA-NICARAGUA I

Background:

A crisis for Costa Rica took place from 11 December 1948 until 21 February 1949.

Pre-crisis Civil war broke out in Costa Rica in March 1948. President Picado, who supported former President Calderón, opposed the election in February of Otilio Ulate as President. Ulate fled the country, and Picado was subsequently overthrown. He left Costa Rica for Nicaragua on 20 April. The country was then governed by a 10-man military junta headed by José Figueres.

Summary:

A crisis for Costa Rica was triggered on 11 December 1948 by an invasion of about 1,000 men, primarily Nicaraguan National Guardsmen, and a number of exiled supporters of Calderón. Costa Rica's response, the same day, was an order for immediate mobilization, the imposition of martial law, and the movement of troops to the frontier with Nicaragua. In addition, Costa Rica appealed to the UN Security Council and the OAS and protested to the Nicaraguan government, which denied the charge. Fighting continued until mid-December, when Costa Rican troops recovered the La Cruz area, which had been occupied by the invaders, and forced them back to the Nicaraguan border.

On 14 December the OAS appointed and dispatched an inquiry commission to the area of conflict to investigate the facts. The committee consisted of representatives from Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the U.S., and it served a mediating role by visiting the dispured region, proposing a resolution and issuing a report on the situation. The report, released on 24 December, stated that the invasion had been led by Costa Rican political exiles and criticized Nicaragua for not having prevented it. A military commission was appointed to supervise activity on the Costa Rican/Nicaraguan border. The crisis ended on 21 February 1949, when the two countries signed a treaty of friendship.

The UN discussed Costa Rica's complaint but left the matter to the OAS. The U.S. was marginally involved in this crisis, as part of the inquiry commission. The USSR was not involved.
