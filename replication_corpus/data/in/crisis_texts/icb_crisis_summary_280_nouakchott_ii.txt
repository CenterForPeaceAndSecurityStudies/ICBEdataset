CRISNO 280

NOUAKCHOTT II

Background:

A second Polisario attack on Mauritania's capital, on 3 July 1977, precipitated another crisis for Mauritania lasting until late that month.

Pre-crisis During the year after Nouakchott I, the Moroccan and Mauritanian armies had undergone major expansion to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of Polisario attacks, the former from 60,000 to 90,000, the latter from 3,000 to 12,000. On 13 May 1977 the Moroccan-Mauritanian Supreme Defense Committee was established to deal with the Western Sahara problem. Its first meeting took place in June.

Summary:

Polisario forces, backed by Algeria, attacked the capital of Mauritania on 3 July 1977, triggering a second crisis for Mauritania. Polisario claimed to have caused heavy losses and damage; Mauritania reported one civilian and one soldier killed. On 12 July the Mauritanian permanent representative to the UN sent a letter to the president of the Security Council accusing Algeria of responsibility for both the attack on Nouakchott and an assault on the Mauritanian ambassador in Paris, and requested an urgent meeting of the Council. However, no UN activity took place. On 15 July Mauritania responded with a reorganization of key positions in its armed forces. The following day the city of Zouerate was attacked by Polisario. And on 18 and 19 July Morocco airlifted 600 troops to Mauritania. Toward the end of July the reorganization of the Mauritanian army had been completed and the threat to the regime was reduced, terminating the crisis for Mauritania.

The OAU met between 2 and 5 July in Gabon and arranged for a special meeting on Western Sahara for October 1977. The U.S. and the USSR remained aloof from this crisis.
