CRISNO 196

CUBAN MISSILES

Background:

There were three crisis actors in the most ominous of all East/West crises, the United States, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. The crisis lasted from 16 October to 20 November 1962. Pre-crisis After the 1961 Bay of Pigs abortive invasion (see Case #181), Cuba became one of the central issues of U.S. foreign policy: the U.S. viewed Cuba as a potential source of communist-oriented subversive activities in Latin America. When the U.S. discovered the presence of Soviet military personnel in Cuba on 7 September 1962 it called up 150,000 reservists. The Soviets mobilized on the 11th. Although persistent rumors circulated concerning the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin denied the charges, and Premier Khrushchev gave his personal assurances that ground-to-ground missiles would never be shipped to Cuba. On the eve of the Missile crisis Washington did not openly challenge the Soviet statements concerning the defensive character of the weapons being sent to Cuba.

Summary:

The U.S. crisis was triggered on 16 October when the CIA presented to President Kennedy photographic evidence of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The U.S. responded with a decision on the 20th to blockade all offensive military equipment en route to Cuba. When this was announced on 22 October, a crisis was triggered for Cuba and the USSR. An urgent meeting of the UN Security Council was requested by both the U.S. and Cuba on the 22nd, and by the USSR the next day. On the 23rd as well, the Soviets accused the United States of violating the UN Charter and announced an alert of its armed forces and those of the Warsaw Pact members. That day Cuba responded by condemning the U.S. blockade and declaring its willingness to fight.

A resolution was adopted on the 23rd by the OAS calling for the withdrawal of the missiles from Cuba and recommending that member-states take all measures, including the use of force, to ensure that the government of Cuba would not continue to receive military material. On 24 October the Security Council adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to confer with the parties. On that same day, U Thant began mediation by sending identical letters to Khrushchev and Kennedy which proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States enter into negotiations, during which period both the shipment of arms and the quarantine would be suspended.

Moscow's major response to the crisis was a letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on 26 October offering the removal of Soviet offensive weapons from Cuba and the cessation of further shipments in exchange for an end to the U.S. quarantine and a U.S. assurance that it would not invade Cuba. The situation was exacerbated on the 27th when a U.S. U-2 surveillance plane was shot down. That day another Khrushchev letter was received in Washington offering the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba in exchange for the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. U.S. mobilization and aerial reconnaissance flights were stepped up. And on the 27th President Kennedy sent the Soviet premier an acceptance of the proposals contained in the letter of 26 October while making no reference to Khrushchev's second letter of the 27th. The following day Khrushchev notified the U.S. government that he had ordered work on the missile sites in Cuba stopped. He agreed to ship the missiles back to the USSR and promised that UN observers would be allowed to verify the dismantling of the sites. At the same time he warned Washington that U-2 reconnaissance flights over Cuba must be stopped as well.

The crisis continued at a lower level of intensity for several more weeks due to Cuban President Castro's demands concerning a U.S. pledge not to invade his country. On 30 October U Thant began talks in Havana, and Kennedy agreed to lift the quarantine for the duration of the talks. When Cuba rejected UN inspection, the U.S. resumed the quarantine and air surveillance.

The Kremlin sent Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba on 2 November to try to persuade Castro to allow UN inspection. When this proved unsuccessful, a U.S.-USSR agreement was reached on 7 November allowing U.S. inspection and interception of Soviet ships leaving Cuba and the photographing of the missiles. The following day the superpowers negotiated the removal of the IL-28 bombers which Castro had claimed were Cuban property. Castro's agreement was conveyed to the U.S. on 20 November 1962, which terminated the Missile crisis for all three actors. The U.S. naval quarantine was lifted immediately, but aerial surveillance continued until the agreement was completely carried out.

U Thant’s mediation efforts had an important impact on crisis resolution. The acting Secretary-General managed to act as a facilitator and kept lines of communication open by contacting both parties. He also used formulative mediation by highlighting common interests and making substantive suggestions to both sides for diffusing the crisis. Overall, U Thant’s mediation effort was a significant factor in easing tensions between crisis actors which contributed to a more rapid termination of the crisis.

Three regional/security organizations were involved in this crisis--the OAS, NATO, and the WTO. Kennedy sent Dean Acheson to Paris on 23 October to brief NATO's Permanent Council on U.S. measures against Cuba. Involved were members of the Warsaw Pact, whose forces were put on alert, and Latin American states which offered military assistance to the U.S.
