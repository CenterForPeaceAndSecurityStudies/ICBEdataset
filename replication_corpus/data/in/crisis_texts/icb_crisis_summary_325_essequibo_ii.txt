CRISNO 325

ESSEQUIBO II

Background:

Guyana and Venezuela experienced another crisis over a large tract of disputed territory from 4 April 1981 to March 1983.

Background Following the 1968 crisis (see Case #228, Essequibo I), there were minor military incidents in 1969 and 1970, until Guyana, Venezuela, and the U.K. formally agreed to a 12-year "cooling-off" period, in the Port of Spain Protocol on 18 June 1970. Thereafter the boundary dispute was quiescent for a decade, until the approach of the expiry date.

Summary:

A crisis for Guyana was triggered by a Venezuelan government statement on 4 April 1981: it did not intend to renew the Port of Spain Protocol in 1982, and it opposed Guyana's Upper Mazaruni hydroelectric project in the disputed territory.

Whatever Venezuela's motives for this statement--to create an image of resoluteness for President Herrera before the 1983 presidential election; to exploit the economic and political vulnerability of Guyana; to strengthen its links with the U.S., since both Venezuela and the United States were concerned about Cuba's influence in the region; and/or to respond to pressure from Venezuelan nationalists to adopt a hard line--Guyana perceived a serious threat to its territorial integrity. It responded the same day by reaffirming its determination to carry on with the project, which was "crucial to the development of the nation." And on territory, Guyana President Burnham stated that his country would "not cede an inch."

In fact, during 1981 the crisis was characterized by a war of words and a diplomatic battle. Venezuela's ambassador to the OAS assured his colleagues in late May that there would be no armed conflict. More important, President Herrera declared on 2 June that Venezuela was committed to "keeping alive the historic claim to the Essequibo territory" and that his country would not renew the Port of Spain Protocol, which was due to expire on 18 June 1982. The U.K. was formally notified of Venezuela's position on the Protocol on 11 December 1981.

Apart from the war of words, there were other indicators of growing tension. In early June 1981, anticipating a possible internal or external attack, Guyana held a 10-day military exercise named "Operation Thunderflash."

Until the late summer of 1981 Venezuela remained the crisis initiator, putting growing pressure on a much weaker adversary. However, at the end of August a new catalyst emerged. Grave concern was expressed by Venezuela's foreign minister about the possible transfer of thousands of Cuban troops then in Angola to Guyana in the near future. That possibility triggered a crisis for Venezuela, especially since Cuba, alone among Caribbean states, had given unqualified support to Guyana on this dispute: Venezuela perceived a threat to its territorial aspirations, a finite time for response (the Port of Spain Protocol was due to expire on 18 June 1982) and a heightened probability of involvement in military hostilities, due to Cuba's unconcealed and active support for Guyana and Guyana's public acknowledgment that, in the event of a Venezuelan attack, it would accept assistance "from any nation that wanted to give it."

In 1982 tension was sustained by the continued war of words. It escalated once again on 18 June 1982 with the expiration of the 12-year "cooling-off" period. On 8 July the Guyana Assembly insisted on Guyana's right to the territory. During the next three months President Burnham expressed his fear of an invasion and refused a Venezuelan proposal for bilateral negotiations. In addition, Guyana accused Venezuela of violating its airspace and producing border incidents, in a letter to the UN on 14 September 1982. The same month President Herrera reaffirmed that Venezuela "wants a peaceful solution."

During the first three months of 1983 Venezuela and Guyana disagreed on the modalities of peaceful crisis resolution. Venezuela proposed bilateral talks; Guyana wanted to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice or the UN Security Council.

The crisis ended in March 1983 when both adversaries formally referred the dispute to mediation by the UN Secretary-General. (During all of 1983 UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar met with the leaders of the two states, but he did not succeed in finding a solution: the tangible dispute was accentuated by the personal antipathy between Herrera and Burnham. UN mediation continued intermittently through January 1999 and primarily involved fact finding.)

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis, though Venezuela tried to elicit U.S. support by playing the "Cuba card": the U.S. did not alter its stance of May 1981, namely, that it had "no position of substance on the issue."

(Other incidents occurred; for example, in December 1983 six Venezuelan fishing boats were seized by Guyana because they were allegedly fishing illegally in Guyana's territorial waters.)
