CRISNO 3

RUSSIAN CIVIL WAR II

Background:

For much of the period of Russian Civil War I in Siberia, Bolshevik Russia experienced another crisis with the Western Allies, in the Arctic region from 23 June 1918 until 27 September 1919.

Summary:

Among the wartime Allies, Canada, France, and the U.K. reacted to revolutionary developments in the former czarist empire and in particular to the Brest-Litovsk treaty by landing troops in the two northern Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk beginning on 23 June 1918; the U.S. provided political support. This multistate intervention triggered a crisis for Communist Russia which, as in Russian Civil War I, perceived a grave threat to its political system. Russia responded almost at once, in serious clashes with British forces and the "Whites." Fighting continued intermittently for 15 months. The Allies had secured control over the regions around the two northern ports but did not attempt to march on St. Petersburg; and the Red Army lacked the power to push them into the sea. The military stalemate and the harsh Russian winter took their toll on the morale of Allied troops. Their evacuation was scheduled for the spring of 1919; but fighting continued through the summer. The withdrawal of Allied forces was completed on 27 September 1919, with Russia the victor by default, as in Russian Civil War I.

There was no global organization at the time of the termination of this crisis.
