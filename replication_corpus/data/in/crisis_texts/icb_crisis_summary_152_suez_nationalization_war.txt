CRISNO 152

SUEZ NATIONALIZATION-WAR

Background:

There were six crisis actors in this two-stage Middle East crisis: France, the U.K., Egypt, the USSR, the U.S., and Israel. The crisis lasted from 26 July 1956 until 12 March 1957.

Background The end of empire with respect to Egypt extended over more than three decades, with three notable events: termination of Britain's protectorate and the formal proclamation of Egypt's independence in February 1922; the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of August 1936, calling for the withdrawal of British forces from Egypt except for 10,000 troops in the Suez Canal Zone--in time of war the number might be increased--and a 20-year alliance; and as a final act the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of October 1954, which provided for the evacuation of all 70,000 British troops from their Suez base within 20 months, that is, by June 1956.

Pre-crisis On several occasions during the early part of 1956 Egypt had voiced its concern about the continued presence of British forces in the Canal Zone. Cairo had also declared its support for the Algerian Front Liberation National (FLN) in its struggle for independence from France. In the meantime the Egyptian monarchy had been overthrown by the Free Officers in 1952; and Colonel Jamal Abd-ul Nasir had emerged as the dominant political figure in Egypt in 1953. Among his ambitious reform goals was the construction of a massive dam at Aswan to harness the waters of the Upper Nile for irrigation and hydroelectric purposes. The U.S. and the U.K. initially pledged financial support for the Aswan Dam project but withdrew their offer in the spring of 1956 because of Nasir's increasing alignment with the USSR, as evident in the Czech.-Egyptian arms deal of September 1955 (see Case #149), which transformed the arms balance in the Arab/Israel domain.

Israel had been subjected to a steady increase of cross-border infiltrations from Egypt-controlled Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula since 1953. It was even more acutely concerned about the flow of arms to Egypt from Czechoslovakia in 1955-56.

Summary:

On 26 July 1956, "Liberation Day," the fourth anniversary of the military regime, Nasir responded to the Anglo-American volte-face on the Aswan Dam by proclaiming the nationalization of the Suez Canal. A 99-year lease to the Anglo-French Suez Canal Corporation was due to expire in 1968. This dramatic act, perceived in London and Paris as portending grave economic and military consequences, triggered a crisis for the two Western powers. On the 30th multilateral talks were initiated--by the U.K., the U.S., France, and Australia--in order to find a peaceful solution. When these talks, as well as an appeal by Britain and France to the United Nations and three international conferences in the summer of 1956, did not result in satisfaction for the aggrieved parties, France initiated bilateral talks with Israel in August aimed at a military riposte. Britain joined its two allies at a conference at Sèvres held between 22-25 October, where they decided to launch a joint military attack on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

Crises for Egypt and the USSR were triggered by an Israeli invasion of Sinai, Israel's Sinai Campaign, on 29 October 1956. Two days later British and French forces landed in the Canal Zone. Egypt responded on 30 October with military resistance, a call for general mobilization, and an appeal to the Soviet Union for military and diplomatic assistance. On 5 November Moscow dispatched a harsh Note to the three invading powers and the United States, referring to the "dangerous consequences" of the aggressive war in Egypt, warning that London, Paris, and Tel Aviv lay under the threat of Soviet missiles and indicating the USSR's intention to use force if the situation were not rectified immediately. This escalated the crisis for Britain and France and triggered a crisis for Israel: all three states perceived a threat of grave damage to their urban centers and population at large. The Soviet Note also triggered a crisis for the United States, threatening its allies, its deterrent credibility, and its international influence.

Britain and France complied at once and agreed to a cease-fire, which came into effect the following day, 6 November. They also stated their intention to withdraw all their forces from the Canal Zone. This marked the termination of the Suez crisis for these two states.

The Soviet Note was received in Israel just after its prime minister had broadcast a "victory" speech to parliament, declaring the 1949 armistice lines "null and void." Israel conferred with France, but in the absence of a credible French military commitment against the Soviet threat, it acquiesced. This took the form of a declaration on 8 November that Israel would evacuate Sinai once arrangements for an emergency international peacekeeping force in Sinai had been concluded. This terminated the crisis for the two superpowers.

The process of Israel's withdrawal, with periodic eruptions of high tension, lasted four months. Its crisis--and with it Egypt's crisis and the Suez Nationalization-War crisis as a whole--ended on 12 March 1957 when Israel's withdrawal from Sinai was completed.

The U.S. responded on 6 November by declaring a semialert and indicated that it would not stand by idly if London and Paris were bombed. Tel Aviv was conspicuously omitted from this warning to Moscow. Although countering the Soviet threat, Washington also pressed its allies to withdraw their forces.

The UN, too, was intensely active, culminating in a decision by the General Assembly to send an Emergency Force to police Sinai and Gaza from which all foreign forces were to be withdrawn. NATO, as the regional security organization of the West, was also involved through a strong counterthreat by the NATO Supreme Commander on 13 November 1956.
