CRISNO 232

WAR OF ATTRITION

Background:

Israel, Egypt, and the USSR were the actors in this two-stage crisis-war from 8 March 1969 until 7 August 1970.

Background and Pre-crisis During the June Six Day War of 1967 (see Case #222) Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula, along with the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. In the autumn of 1968 Egypt's leaders perceived that the strategic balance had turned in its favor permitting a limited military initiative against Israel along the Canal. Accordingly Egyptian artillery bombarded Israeli positions on the east bank of the Canal in September and October. Israel responded with a display of force--the destruction of Egypt's power station at Naj Hamadi on 31 October. Egypt desisted from further military activity; and several months of tranquility followed on the Sinai front.

Summary:

On 8 March 1969 Egypt launched the War of Attrition with intense artillery fire against Israel's "Bar Lev Line" on the east side of the Canal. This triggered a crisis for Israel. After heightened losses in May, June, and July, Israel responded with air raids into Egypt on 20 July catalyzing a crisis for Egypt. As a result a planned Egyptian offensive to cross the Canal was set aside. Israeli threat perceptions declined. And when Israeli air raids were suspended on 28 July the first crisis for both actors, along with the first stage of the War of Attrition, came to an end.

The fighting escalated in October, when Israeli air raids destroyed SAM-2 batteries and Egyptian antiaircraft systems. But the catalyst to the second stage of the crisis-war and an intra-war crisis for Egypt was Israeli deep-penetration raids into Egypt beginning on 7 January 1970. Nasir, concerned that the raids might generate domestic pressure that would endanger his regime, appealed to the Soviet Union for aid: during a visit to Moscow starting on 22 January he requested Soviet military advisors and the introduction of a sophisticated missile air defense system into Egypt. Nasir's threat to resign if his requests were not met triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. It responded favorably: by 19 March Soviet missile batteries were installed in Egypt near the Canal triggering Israel's second--intrawar--crisis of the War of Attrition. Israel responded with intensive bombing of these antiaircraft sites on 24 March. And in a rare direct Israeli encounter with Soviet military personnel during the entire Arab/Israel conflict Israeli- and Soviet-piloted aircraft clashed on 18 April.

Intense U.S. pressure led to a cease-fire on 7 August based upon Secretary of State Rogers's Plan "B" (19 June 1970) terminating the War of Attrition. Rogers's Plan "A" (9 December 1969), designed to bring about a peaceful solution on the principle of land for peace, remained unfulfilled until the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty of 1979.

Big Four talks--the U.S., the USSR, the U.K., and France--under the auspices of the UN contributed marginally to crisis abatement. The Soviet Union supplied arms and missiles to Egypt and influenced it to abandon plans for a cross-Canal military operation in 1969. In addition to mediation efforts the U.S. also employed delaying tactics in the delivery of Phantom jets to Israel as a form of pressure to accept a cease-fire. On the whole both superpowers played an important role in crisis management. The Arab League held a conference in December 1969 but had no impact on the crisis outcome.
