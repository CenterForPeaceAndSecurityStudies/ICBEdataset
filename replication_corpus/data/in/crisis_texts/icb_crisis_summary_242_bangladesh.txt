CRISNO 242

BANGLADESH

Background:

The crisis over Bangladesh took place from 25 March to 17 December 1971; Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India were the crisis actors.

Background and Pre-crisis When the British withdrew from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, West and East Pakistan were separated by 1,000 kilometers of Indian territory. Since 1958 Pakistan was ruled by a military junta led by Ayub Khan and, later, Yahya Khan. The overwhelming victory of the Awami League in the 1970 East Pakistan (East Bengal) elections for representatives to the Pakistan National Assembly placed Pakistan's political structure in jeopardy, especially the supremacy of the military-controlled executive over representative institutions, and West Pakistan's dominance over East Pakistan. Negotiations between the two principal political leaders, West Pakistan's Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Awami League's Sheikh Mujibar Rahman, including an offer of the prime ministership to the latter, failed to break the impasse.

In mid-February 1971 a decision was made by the military rulers in West Pakistan to suppress the growing fervor of East Bengali nationalism. Troops were posted to the East. On 1 March President Yahya Khan postponed the opening of the National Assembly. This was protested by the Awami League, which launched a noncooperation movement on the 6th. A declaration of Bangladesh's independence was scheduled for 6 March; but on that day Yahya Khan announced that the National Assembly would convene on 25 March. While the West Pakistani military buildup in East Pakistan continued, the Awami League took over civil administration of the region.

Summary:

On 25 March a crisis for Bangladesh (still formally known as East Pakistan and East Bengal) was triggered by a West Pakistani army attack on the student dormitories of Dacca University. The response, the following day, was a declaration of independence by East Bengali political leaders. This triggered a crisis for Pakistan, which responded the same day by outlawing the Awami League and suppressing the East Pakistan (East Bengal) revolt with violence. While fighting raged over the spring and summer, an estimated nine million refugees fled from Bangladesh to India, causing severe economic problems there. A number of these refugees were then trained and armed by India to fight the West Pakistanis.

Throughout the autumn of 1971 there were minor clashes between the Indian and Pakistani armies. The situation reached crisis proportions for India when, on 12 October, orders were given to concentrate Pakistani troops on the Indian Punjab border. On 21 November the Indian army crossed into West Pakistan, causing another crisis for Pakistan, already at war with Bangladesh. Pakistan responded on 3 December with an air attack on Indian airfields in Kashmir. Indian forces poised on the East Pakistan border overwhelmed the Pakistani troops in the seceding territory within a fortnight. The war ended on 17 December 1971 with Pakistan's surrender and the emergence of a new sovereign state on the Indian subcontinent.

The UN, approached by Bangladesh in March 1971, declared the problem an internal matter for Pakistan. The Security Council was the most active UN organ; it discussed the situation several times but was unable to pass a resolution, due to a Soviet veto. During the war between Pakistan and India, on 7 December, the General Assembly succeeded in passing a resolution calling for a cease-fire, which, although ignored by India, did have a marginal effect on abating the crisis. On 22 December the Security Council passed a compromise resolution calling for the withdrawal of all armed forces "as soon as practicable."

The most important Soviet activity was the signing of a Treaty of Friendship with India in August 1971, providing active support by a superpower in case of war with Pakistan. The USSR also moved naval vessels in the direction of the Bay of Bengal on 15 December, as a symbol of support for India. And it moved troops closer to the Sino/Soviet border in order to deter Beijing from becoming involved. Besides considerable U.S. political activity, its Seventh Fleet was moved into the Bay of Bengal on 13 December 1971, in support of Pakistan.
