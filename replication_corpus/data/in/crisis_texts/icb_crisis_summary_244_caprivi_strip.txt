CRISNO 244

CAPRIVI STRIP

Background:

Zambia's crisis over the Caprivi Strip occurred from 5 to 12 October 1971.

Background South Africa and Zambia share a common border along the Caprivi Strip, a long narrow strip of land in the far northeast corner of South Africa-ruled South-West Africa (later, Namibia). Large operational bases in the area were maintained by South African Defence and Police (SADP) forces against guerrilla infiltration. Economic conditions in Zambia deteriorated toward the end of 1970 when world copper prices were forced down.

Summary:

A crisis was triggered for Zambia on 5 October 1971 when South African Prime Minister John Vorster announced that a Union police vehicle along the Zambian border had been blown up by a land mine. He placed responsibility on Zambia, charging that it had made Zambia's territory available for "this sort of aggression." Units of the South African security forces crossed into Zambia in order to pursue alleged perpetrators. On 8 October Zambia requested a special session of the UN Security Council to discuss the "numerous violations of South African forces against the sovereignty, airspace and territorial integrity of Zambia." Zambia's President Kaunda announced that compulsory national service and Home Guards would reinforce the regular army as part of the country's defense system.

A Security Council resolution on the 12th, condemning South Africa and calling on it to respect the sovereignty of Zambia, terminated the crisis, although Zambia viewed the resolution as "watered down" and insufficient. Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
