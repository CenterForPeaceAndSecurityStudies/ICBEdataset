CRISNO 308

RAID ON ANGOLA

Background:

A South African incursion into Angola caused another brief crisis for Angola from 28 October to 2 November 1979.

Background and Pre-crisis In September 1979 Augustino Neto, who had led Angola to independence and had been its president since 1975, died. A day after his death Angola reported a South African attack on several economic targets in southern Angola by troops stationed in South-West Africa. Then, on 13 October, reportedly for the first time, Angolan forces crossed into South-West Africa.

Summary:

On 28 October South African troops attacked roads and bridges 190 kilometers inside Angola, in the Sierra da Leba area. Angola responded on the 31st with an appeal to the United Nations. The Angolan ambassador to Belgium and the MPLA's Politburo were especially vocal in their accusations of South African hostile activity.

Angola's crisis ended on 2 November when the Security Council adopted another resolution condemning South Africa and calling for an immediate SADF withdrawal. The U.S.'s abstention from the vote was perceived unfavorably by Angola. There was no change in the Angola/South Africa relationship after the crisis ended and no reports of withdrawal by the SADF from Angola at the end of the raids. The stalemate continued.

There was no regional organization activity during the crisis, though earlier, on 6-20 July, the OAU Council of Ministers, as well as the OAU heads of state and government, had met to discuss the ongoing dispute between South Africa and Angola.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis.
