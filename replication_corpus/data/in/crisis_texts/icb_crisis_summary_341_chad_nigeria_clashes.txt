CRISNO 341

CHAD-NIGERIA CLASHES

Background:

Chad and Nigeria experienced a border crisis from 18 April until 11 July 1983.

Background and Pre-crisis Both of these states were granted independence in 1960--Chad by France, Nigeria by the U.K. Relations were cooperative until the late 1970s, when oil exploration in the undemarcated Lake Chad region portended substantial wealth for the beneficiary of the discovery of oil.

The bilateral relationship was complicated by the role of Nigerian soldiers as peacekeepers in Chad, under OAU auspices in 1979 and again in 1981 at the invitation of the then-victorious Goukouni regime. They were compelled to leave Chad by Habré, who replaced Goukouni in 1982.

The problem was compounded by the emergence of new islands in the Lake Chad region as a result of falling water levels in the lake. Some of these were being used as sanctuaries by anti-Habré Chadian forces, who were harassing Nigerian fishers.

Summary:

Amid incidents along the border, Nigerian soldiers were sent to Kinsara Island in the disputed Lake Chad area on 18 April 1983 to protect Nigerian fishers. This was perceived as a threat to territory and triggered a crisis for Chad. Its violent response the same day catalyzed a crisis for Nigeria. Serious clashes ensued until 24 April. At the end of April Chadian troops attacked--and recaptured--Kinsara Island. Nigeria responded with retaliatory raids.

In late May the intensity of the border clashes seemed to subside. Nigeria's foreign minister spoke, prematurely, about a peaceful solution based upon revived joint patrols of the border area, along with demarcation, by a committee appointed by the Chad Basin Commission, of the borders of its four member-states, Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon.

Intermittent clashes continued until 2 July when the presidents of Chad and Nigeria met. An agreement signed on 11 July formally ended the fighting and reopened the disputed border, terminating the crisis. There were few casualties in the fighting, an estimated 75 Chadian soldiers and nine Nigerians.

The two superpowers, the UN, and the OAU were not involved in this crisis.
