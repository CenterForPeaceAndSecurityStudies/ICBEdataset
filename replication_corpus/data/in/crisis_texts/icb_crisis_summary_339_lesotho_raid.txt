CRISNO 339

LESOTHO RAID

Background:

Lesotho experienced a crisis with the Union of South Africa from 9 to 15 December 1982.

Background and Pre-crisis Lesotho, like Angola and Zambia, experienced violent crises with South Africa from the early 1970s, as part of Pretoria's continuing struggle against the African National Congress (ANC) (see Background to Case #323). In early 1982, economic and political sites in Lesotho were attacked. On 26 May the Prime Minister of Lesotho, Chief Jonathan, accused the Pretoria regime of supporting these raids, a charge that was emphatically denied.

On 7 August Lesotho's Minister of Works, Jobo K. Rampeta, was killed in an ambush. The next day Pretoria sent a message of sympathy. On the 11th Lesotho rejected this apology. A border incident was reported the same day; and, once more, Lesotho accused South Africa of responsibility.

Summary:

A crisis for Lesotho was triggered on 9 December 1982 when the South Africa Defence Forces launched a raid against the homes of ANC members in its capital, Maseru, killing 32. The next day Chief Jonathan condemned the raid. A complaint to the UN led to a Security Council resolution on 15 December, condemning South Africa's attack. This terminated Lesotho's crisis.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved.

(On 9 February 1983 South Africa's foreign minister, in a letter to the UN Secretary-General, rejected the resolution, asserted Pretoria's wish to negotiate nonaggression pacts with its neighbors, and claimed the right to take measures to defend the life and property of its citizens.)
