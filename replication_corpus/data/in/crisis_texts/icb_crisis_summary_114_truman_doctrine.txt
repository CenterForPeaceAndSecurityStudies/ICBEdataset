CRISNO 114

TRUMAN DOCTRINE

Background:

An international crisis culminating in the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine lasted from 21 February to 22 May 1947. There were three crisis actors: Greece, Turkey, and the United States.

Background Soviet demands for the transfer of Turkish territories in 1945 and 1946 deepened U.S. suspicion about USSR intentions in the eastern Mediterranean (see Cases #106 and #111). In Greece, civil war was raging, with support and bases for Greek Communists being supplied by Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria (see Case #112). Thus societal unrest and mass violence were rampant in Greece. Labor strikes erupted in the cities. And on 30 January 1946 martial law was declared. The U.K., struggling to restore economic stability at home following the massive dislocations of World War II, decided it could no longer bear the burden of military and economic aid to Greece and economic assistance to Turkey.

Summary:

The U.K. announcement on 21 February 1947 of its intention to discontinue aid to Greece and Turkey by 31 March triggered a crisis for the U.S., Greece, and Turkey. For the U.S., the issue was fear of Soviet hegemony in the eastern Mediterranean region, while Greece and Turkey perceived a threat to their respective political regimes. Turkey felt obliged to keep its army fully mobilized in order to discourage and forestall Soviet aggression. Its major response, on 21 February, was to request aid from the U.S. Similarly, upon the advice of President Truman, Greece responded to the U.K. announcement by sending a formal Note to Washington on 27 February requesting U.S. aid. Truman asked Congress on 12 March to grant military and economic assistance to Greece and Turkey in order to offset communist threats. The crisis for all three states ended when an aid bill was signed on 22 May 1947. This marked the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine, with a U.S. offer of aid to countries threatened by the Communist bloc during the first stage of the Cold War.

There was no discussion about Turkey in the United Nations; but the Security Council established a commission to investigate Greek border violations. The report, issued in May 1947, called for an end to external assistance to Greek Communist guerrillas. A resolution to that effect, and with it further UN activity, was vetoed by the USSR.
