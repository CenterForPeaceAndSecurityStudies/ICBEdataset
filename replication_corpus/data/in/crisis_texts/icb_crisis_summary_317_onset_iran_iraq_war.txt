CRISNO 317

ONSET IRAN-IRAQ WAR

Background:

Iran and Iraq experienced several crises during Gulf War I, 1980-88. The first lasted from 17 September until 30 November 1980.

Pre-crisis The specific focus of conflict, which erupted into full-scale war in mid-September 1980, was the Shatt-al-Arab. Despite the 1937 agreement there were interstate crises between Iran and Iraq in 1959-60 and 1969 (see Cases #172, #234). Another agreement between them was reached in Algiers on 6 March 1975; and a more formal "reconciliation" treaty was signed in Baghdad on 13 June 1975 recognizing the Shatt-al-Arab as the common border between Iran and Iraq.

(Mis)calculating that the turmoil in Iran following the ouster of the shah offered a unique opportunity to assert Iraqi primacy over the Shatt-al-Arab, Saddam Hussein expressed dissatisfaction with the 1975 accord on several occasions in 1979. Relations between the two states became increasingly tense, exacerbated by growing unrest among the predominantly Arab population in Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan. There were also increasingly shrill mutual accusations of hostility and responsibility for cross-border land and air clashes.

In March 1980 Iraq began to launch commando raids into Iranian territory. On 7 April Iran placed its armed forces on full alert and responded with an anti-Iraqi propaganda campaign. On the 16th Iran announced the formation of a "Revolutionary Islamic Army for the Liberation of Iraq" and called upon the people of Iraq to revolt against the Ba'ath regime. The same day Saddam Hussein warned that war could not be excluded from the escalating conflict and demanded Iran's recognition of the Arab character of Khuzestan. And on 10 September he linked the clashes to Iraq's territorial claims.

Summary:

On 17 September 1980 President Saddam Hussein announced in Iraq's National Assembly the formal abrogation of the 1975 treaty; and he proclaimed full Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. This triggered Iran's first crisis of Gulf War I. Four days later Iraqi forces launched a major offensive, occupying much of the border area including parts of Khorramshahr. They also almost completely encircled Iran's principal oil refinery at Abadan. And on the 22nd Iraqi planes attacked six Iranian air bases and four army bases.

Iran responded on the 23rd with powerful counterattacks on air bases in the heart of Iraq, at Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, Habaniya, Kut, and Nasiriya, triggering a crisis for Iraq. The same day Iraq occupied about 120 square kilometers of Iranian territory, after encountering only minor resistance. Its main offensive was in the direction of Khuzestan and Iran's key oil facilities. By 28 September Iraq was poised to seize all of southwestern Iran. The battle raged on, with the adversaries striking oil and other economic targets, bombing towns, sinking naval vessels, etc. On 5 October both Abadan and Khorramshahr were reported to be ablaze, and the Iraqi city of al-Faw to be deserted. The same day Iraq's governing body, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), withdrew a conditional cease-fire offer of 24 September and vowed to "continue the just and honorable battle whatever its duration and the sacrifices required."

On 17 November 1980 Teheran Radio claimed that Iranian troops had driven Iraqi forces from Susangerd. On the 19th, noting the absence of any further advances by Iraqi troops, Iran's President Bani-Sadr called for "total victory" over Iraq's Saddam Hussein: this marked the end of Iran's crisis. By 30 November, according to a consensus of foreign journalists reporting from the battlefront, Iraqi forces had dug in and a stalemate followed, terminating the onset crisis--and the first phase--of the Iran/Iraq War.

The U.S. posture, proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter on 22 September 1980, was "strict neutrality." However, because of the grave danger of curtailed oil supplies to U.S. allies in Europe and Japan, by mid-October some 60 warships of the U.S., the U.K., France, and Australia were patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, the vital passageway that links the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The USSR, too, from the beginning, proclaimed a policy of strict noninterference, while accusing the U.S. of attempting to exploit the conflict for Cold War ends. In reality, the Soviet Union and its East European clients provided limited arms supplies to both Iran and Iraq. The former also received weapons from Syria, Libya, and Israel, while France and North Korea sent arms to Iraq.

There were several failed efforts to mediate the Iran/Iraq conflict in the onset phase as, in fact, throughout the eight-year war. The UN Security Council unanimously called for a cease-fire, to take effect on 25 September. On 5 November the UN Secretary-General was asked by the Security Council to send a special representative to the area of conflict. Similarly, the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO) sent a Good Offices mission headed by the president of Pakistan. And the Non-Aligned Movement sent a mediation committee on 21 October. All third party efforts at crisis management were to no avail.
