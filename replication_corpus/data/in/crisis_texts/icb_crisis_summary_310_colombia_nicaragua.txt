CRISNO 310

COLOMBIA-NICARAGUA

Background:

Colombia and Nicaragua were the adversaries in a crisis over long-standing competing claims to the San Andrés Archipelago. It lasted from 12 December 1979 to 8 July 1981.

Background The roots of this territorial conflict can be traced to the era of Spain's colonial rule. In 1803 a Spanish Royal Order allocated the islands of the San Andrés Archipelago, along with three uninhabited cays, Quita Sueño, Roncador, and Serrana, to the viceroyalty of Santa Fé de Bogotá, precursor to present-day Colombia and Panama, extending to the Mosquito Coast. In 1853 Nicaragua claimed sovereignty over the Atlantic coast and its nearby islands. So too did independent Colombia.

The United States, which had controlled the economically valuable cays since 1869, took possession in 1919. On 24 March 1928 the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty between Colombia and the U.S. recognized the former's sovereignty over the San Andrés Islands. A follow-up agreement between them on 10 April gave Colombia fishing rights around the cays but recognized that sovereignty over these reefs remained in dispute. Nicaragua, which was occupied by U.S. marines in 1928, accepted the Barcenas Meneses-Esguerra Treaty on 6 March 1930. A much later agreement between Washington and Bogotá, the Vasquez-Saccio Treaty of 8 September 1972, accorded sovereignty over the cays to Colombia and divided fishing rights equally between the two states. The treaty was ratified by Colombia--but not by the U.S. because of intense lobbying by the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. The ratification process was rescheduled for January 1980.

Summary:

On 12 December 1979 Nicaragua claimed jurisdiction over a 200-mile continental shelf, triggering a crisis for Colombia. Bogotá's initial response, on the 20th, was to repudiate the claim. On 26 January 1980 the United States urged a judicial solution to the territorial dispute.

Nicaragua escalated the crisis on 4 February by issuing a "white book" that claimed all of the San Andrés Archipelago; at the same time it indicated a willingness to negotiate. Two days later Colombia rejected negotiations with Nicaragua. Its major response to the crisis, on 7 February, was to reinforce bases in and around the San Andrés Islands and to deploy three surface warships and a submarine to the area. This high-visibility signal of Colombia's intent to use force, if necessary, triggered a crisis for Nicaragua. In the event, no violence occurred. Rather, Nicaragua responded with persistent pressure in an effort to block U.S. ratification of the 1972 treaty between Colombia and the United States. The ratification process took another 18 months, until 7 July 1981, when the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, which formalized Colombia's sovereignty over the long-disputed islands and cays. This ended Colombia's crisis, in victory, and Nicaragua's crisis, in defeat.

The U.S., as noted, was very active throughout and played a crucial role in crisis resolution. Neither the USSR nor the OAS was involved. And the UN was involved only indirectly: Colombia referred its grievance to the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, which was unable to settle the dispute.
