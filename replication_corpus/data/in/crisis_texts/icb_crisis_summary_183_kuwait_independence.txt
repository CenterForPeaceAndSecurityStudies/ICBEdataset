CRISNO 183

KUWAIT INDEPENDENCE

Background:

Iraq, Kuwait, and the U.K. were the direct participants in a crisis over Kuwait's independence from 19 June until 13 July 1961.

Summary:

Kuwait was granted its independence by the U.K. on 19 June 1961, accompanied by a mutual defense treaty. This triggered a crisis for Iraq. On the 25th Prime Minister Qassem vigorously renewed the claim that Kuwait was an integral part of Iraq and threatened action, including violence, to nullify Kuwait's independence. This catalyzed a crisis for Kuwait. Perceiving a threat to its existence, Kuwait responded on the 30th with a formal request to Britain for assistance under the provisions of their defense agreement. This in turn generated a crisis for the U.K. On 1 July it began a rapid military buildup in Kuwait: within one week British forces numbered 6,000.

The same day Kuwait appealed to the UN Security Council. The Council discussed the matter; but a draft resolution critical of Iraq was vetoed by the USSR. Moreover, Egypt's proposal for the withdrawal of British troops did not secure a Security Council majority. In July 1961 the Arab League admitted Kuwait to membership in the face of Iraq's protests and established a Pan-Arab force of mostly Jordanians and Sa'udi Arabians to defend Kuwait.

The Kuwait Independence crisis ended on 13 July when Iraq's military attach√© in the U.K. denied that Iraq intended to attack Kuwait or that it had concentrated troops on the border.

The U.S. was not involved in this crisis.

(With recognition by the Arab world the emir of Kuwait requested British troops to leave; the evacuation was completed by October 1961. After the downfall of General Qassem in February 1963 Iraq recognized Kuwait's independence--but not the finality of the Iraq/Kuwait border. [This was to remain a source of persistent tension and was a precipitating cause of the Gulf crisis-war in 1990-91--see Case #393.] Iraq, which had boycotted the Arab League after its admission of Kuwait, withdrew its claim to all of Kuwait in the autumn of 1963.

On 10 November 1994, for the first time, Iraq formally recognized Kuwait's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its borders as demarcated after the 1991 war. This was in accord with a UN Security Council resolution during the October 1994 Iraq Troop Deployment--Kuwait crisis [see Case #412].)
