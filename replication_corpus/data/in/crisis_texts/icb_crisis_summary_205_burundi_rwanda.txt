CRISNO 205

BURUNDI-RWANDA

Background:

A crisis between Rwanda and Burundi began on 21 December 1963 and ended sometime in April 1964.

Background and Pre-crisis Relations between Rwanda and Burundi had been strained since precolonial times. Both were traditional sacred kingdoms ruled by a Mwami (king). Each kingdom was populated by three ethnic groups: the Tutsi, the Hutu, and the Twa. The Tutsi traditionally dominated politics, the military, and social life in both kingdoms.

The Belgian-administered UN Trust Territory of Ruanda-Urundi achieved independence as two separate states on 1 July 1962: the southern part became the Kingdom of Burundi, and the northern part became the Republic of Rwanda. Attempts by the UN to bring about the creation of a single independent state had failed.

Between 1960 and 1964 some 200,000 members of the Tutsi tribe left Rwanda and settled in the border regions of neighboring states, the Congo, Uganda, Burundi, and Tanganyika. Many of the Tutsi, however, had not given up the hope of returning to Rwanda to reestablish the monarchy (officially abolished on 2 October 1961) and thus reestablish their traditional position as political and military rulers over the majority Hutu.

Early in December 1963 the Burundi government dispersed a group of about 5,000 Tutsi refugees who had gathered on the border with Rwanda apparently intending to unleash an armed attack against their former homeland.

Summary:

On 21 December 1963 a crisis was triggered for Rwanda when a band of about 5,000 Tutsi exiles, armed with bows and arrows and a few rifles, invaded Rwanda from Burundi territory. The Rwanda government responded the same day by meeting the invasion with force, broadcasting a warning to the Hutu population to be "on the alert" for Tutsi invaders, and by dividing the country into nine emergency regions. By 27 December the attack had reportedly been repulsed, but the level of tension had not decreased. Bitter attacks were directed against the remaining Tutsi population in Rwanda, which appeared to have been condoned and even supported by the government. These massacres created an international problem that immediately involved the UN.

A crisis for Burundi was triggered on 22 January 1964 when it was reported that troops of the Rwanda army had violated Burundi territory and "massacred" a number of Burundi inhabitants in the border area. The Burundi response was an appeal, on 28 January 1964, to the UN and the OAU to intervene and "to put an end to provocations by Rwanda." King Mwambutsa of Burundi also wrote to UN Secretary-General U Thant to complain of the frontier violations by Rwanda. The crisis ended some time in April, without a formal agreement: by then the threat of military hostilities had been reduced sufficiently for President Kayibanda of Rwanda to allow some of the Tutsi émigrés back into the country.

UN activity was limited to dealing with the refugee problem: a Special Representative was appointed for this purpose by the Secretary-General. The OAU was minimally involved through its good offices. Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved.

(The overthrow of the king in Burundi in November 1966 facilitated a final agreement in March 1967 whereby all Tutsi refugees could return to their homes after giving up their arms.)
