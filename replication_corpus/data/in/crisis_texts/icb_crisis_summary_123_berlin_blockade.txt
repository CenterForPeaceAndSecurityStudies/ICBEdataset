CRISNO 123

BERLIN BLOCKADE

Background:

The crisis actors in the first of three international crises over Berlin were the France, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR. It began on 24 June 1948 and ended on 12 May 1949.

Background and Pre-crisis Escalation of tension between the Western powers and the Soviet Union centered around the issue of occupied Germany and, especially, Berlin. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 divided Germany into four zones and Berlin into four sectors, but decreed that the country was to be treated as one economic unit under the Allied Control Council (ACC). The Potsdam rules began to unravel on 6 march 1948 when, during a pause in their Tripartite London Conference, the Western powers issued a communiqué indicating their intention to merge their zones in West Germany. The USSR responded by walking out of an Allied Control Council meeting on 20 march. Then, on 1 April the Russians temporarily restricted Western access to Berlin by the imposition of a "baby blockade." On June 7, the Western powers issued a declaration formalizing their 6 March communiqué, with the stated goal of integrating West Germany into the democratic community of Western Europe. This increased the Soviet perception of threat to communist influence in Europe but not, yet, of the greater likelihood of war. The U.K., the U.S., and France met once more in June.

Summary:

On 7 June 1948 the Western powers published the recommendations of the March 1948 London Conference, to which the Soviet Union had not been invited, to integrate their zones in Germany. This triggered a crisis for Moscow, which perceived a basic threat to its influence in Europe. The USSR responded on 24 June by blockading all Western transportation into and out of Berlin. The Soviets also cut off all electric current, coal, food, and other supplies to West Berlin.

This triggered a crisis for the U.S., the U.K., and France; the future of Germany and, with it, their influence in Europe was at stake. The response by the Western powers, on 26 June 1948, was to step up the airlift to Berlin, which had begun two months earlier, and to continue with plans for the rehabilitation of Germany as part of Western Europe. Talks to break the diplomatic deadlock began in August. By 2l March 1949 the blockade had been almost completely lifted. A full agreement was reached on 12 May, the termination date for all four crisis actors; it left Germany split into two embryonic states -- the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (DDR).

Throughout the crisis, the UN was highly involved in the conflict resolution process but only had limited effect. Following a complaint by France, the U.K., and the U.S. in September 1948, a UN Security Council draft resolution calling for the lifting of the blockade and the resumption of talks was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On 5 October 1948, the Security Council voted to begin discussing the crisis, and a neutral commission, consisting of China, Syria, Canada, Belgium, Colombia and Argentina, was set up to study the currency problem and mediate. However, it failed to achieve an agreement among the Four Powers. Appeals by the UN Secretary-General and the president of the General Assembly also had no effect. Talks were held in the winter of 1949 between the Soviet and U.S. representatives to the UN. The status of Berlin catalyzed a second crisis in November 1958 (see Case #168--Berlin Deadline).
