CRISNO 103

OKINAWA

Background:

Japan's IWC over the island of Okinawa took place from 1 April to 21 June 1945.

Pre-crisis By the spring of 1945 both time and space for Japan had run out. U.S. victories in the Philippines and Iwo Jima had chiseled away the outer walls of Japan's outposts of defense; and the route to final victory was controlled by Allied air and naval power. On 21 March a U.S. aircraft carrier, penetrating Japanese inland waters, attacked principal units of the Japanese Home Fleet, damaging 15 warships and destroying 475 planes. Japanese suicide attacks had become a calculated tactic as the U.S. proceeded to plan for the occupation of Okinawa, 325 miles from Japanese cities.

Summary:

On 1 April 1945 U.S. marines and army troops invaded Okinawa and triggered another intrawar crisis for Japan. A Japanese attempt to check this amphibious operation resulted in the sinking by U.S. aircraft of the Japanese battleship Yamato, two cruisers, and three destroyers. On 5 April the Koiso cabinet collapsed in Tokyo. That day, as well, the Soviets announced that they would not renew their Neutrality Pact with Japan. One of the most extensive suicide assaults of modern warfare was launched by Japan on 6 April. A five-hour battle ensued in which 135 kamikaze pilots sank six vessels and damaged 18 others. Heavy fighting in April brought the adversaries to a stalemate. Toward the end of the month a Japanese counterattack was launched. The U.S. advances were slowed down both by strong resistance and heavy rains. On 9 June the new Prime Minister, Suzuki, announced that Japan would continue to defend itself to the end and that unconditional surrender was out of the question. Official resistance on Okinawa ended on 21 June 1945. The Okinawa campaign was the climax of Japan's final resistance; it left little room for doubt as to the outcome of the Pacific war.
