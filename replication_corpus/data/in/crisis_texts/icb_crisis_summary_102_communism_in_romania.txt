CRISNO 102

COMMUNISM IN ROMANIA

Background:

A crisis between the Soviet Union and Romania lasted from 24 February to 6 March 1945.

Background The Soviet August 1944 offensive against Germany prompted a palace revolt in Bucharest on 23 August 1944, and Romania became part of the Allied war effort against Germany (see Case #93--Soviet Occupation of East Europe, in Multiregional PCs: World War II). Predominant Soviet influence in Romania was recognized by the Allies in September 1944. Following the palace coup there was a succession of governments. Radescu was appointed Prime Minister in December 1944. The domestic political situation during his tenure was very fluid, and the country became increasingly paralyzed between Right and Left. Disturbances occurred in factories, with communist attempts to take over workshop committees. In February 1945 unrest steadily mounted, with violent criticisms in the Soviet media. The Romanian press was suppressed.

Summary:

A Soviet crisis was triggered on 24 February 1945 when rioting erupted in Bucharest. That evening Premier Radescu broadcast a call to resist all foreign attempts at intervention in Romania's affairs. The USSR response was the dispatch of Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to Bucharest on 27 February. Moscow demanded that Radescu be replaced immediately on the grounds that he was incapable of maintaining order. When King Michael refused to consider this, Vyshinsky issued an ultimatum to appoint the "democratic choice" as Premier, Petru Groza, the Soviet candidate for the position. He also informed the king that his refusal would be interpreted as a hostile act against the Soviet Union. Simultaneous with Vyshinsky's ultimatum, the Soviet Command in Bucharest moved Romanian troops from the capital to the front, eliminating the king's chances of resistance while one million Soviet troops remained within striking distance of the capital. This ultimatum, on 28 February, triggered a crisis for Romania. Soviet demands were complied with on 1 March. The termination date for both crisis actors was 6 March 1945, when Groza was installed as Prime Minister after the king had overcome domestic opposition.

The League of Nations was not functioning in 1945.
