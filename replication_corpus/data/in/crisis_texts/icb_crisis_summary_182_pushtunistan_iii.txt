CRISNO 182

PUSHTUNISTAN III

Background:

The ongoing territorial conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalated to crisis proportions again from 19 May 1961 to 29 January 1962.

Summary:

Another crisis for Pakistan was generated by reports on 19 May 1961 of a violent infiltration by 1,000 Afghan troops into its territory. Two days later the Pakistan air force bombed areas along the border that it claimed were illegally occupied by Afghan troops. This claim was categorically denied by an Afghanistan embassy spokesman in Karachi. On 23 August 1961, in a note to the Afghanistan government, Pakistan's foreign ministry demanded the closure of Afghan consulates and trade agencies in Pakistan, which it claimed were being used for anti-Pakistani and other subversive activities. This triggered a crisis for Afghanistan. Kabul responded on 30 August that it would consider diplomatic relations as broken unless Pakistan withdrew its demands. Pakistan replied on 2 September by issuing a White Paper claiming that Afghanistan's policy of "expansionism" was the main cause of the hostilities. Diplomatic relations were severed on the 6th.

U.S. and U.K. efforts in October to settle the dispute did not bear fruit immediately. In mid October 1961 President Kennedy's special envoy, L. T. Merchant, traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan as a representative from the U.S. to begin mediation, which ended unsuccessfully on 7 November 1961. However, on 29 January 1962 Merchant succeeded in making possible the delivery of goods from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and the frontier was temporarily reopened, ending the crisis for both actors. During the crisis the Soviet Union supplied economic aid and weapons to Afghanistan. The UN remained aloof from this crisis.

(Diplomatic relations between the adversaries were not reestablished until 24 January 1964.)
