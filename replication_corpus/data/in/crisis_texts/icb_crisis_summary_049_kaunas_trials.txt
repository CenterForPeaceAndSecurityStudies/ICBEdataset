CRISNO 49

KAUNAS TRIALS

Background:

Lithuania's crisis with Germany over the Kaunas trials lasted from 28 March to 25 September 1935.

Background The Versailles Treaty following World War I placed the city of Memel under Allied sovereignty. It was occupied by Lithuania in 1923, and the following year the League of Nations awarded Memel a special status under Lithuanian sovereignty. A dissatisfied Germany, which declared its intention to regain the city, was eagerly supported by Memel's German inhabitants. Parallel to the Nazi rise to power in Germany, Nazi and Nazi-front organizations became active in Lithuania. In 1934 an accusation of conspiracy against Lithuania was made against 122 Nazis who were tried in Kaunas. On 26 March 1935 they were found guilty.

Summary:

In response to the Kaunas trials Germany closed its border with Lithuania and imposed economic sanctions. This triggered a crisis for Lithuania on 28 March. Even before the trial had ended Memel police and border guards had been alerted to the possibility of an uprising or even an invasion. When Hitler urged the three guarantor powers (Britain, France, and Italy) to take action, they handed a protest note to Lithuania together with a threat to bring the issue to the League.

Tension reached its peak when, on 17 May, a Lithuanian appeals court upheld all the sentences except one. That day Germany moved its troops to the border, as did Lithuania while calling up reserve forces. During the period between May and September tension remained high, with Germany's repeated declarations of hostility. On 25 September elections were held in Memel, and their results led to a temporary reduction of tension. A d√©tente between Germany and Lithuania was reached when the latter agreed to new amendments in its electoral laws.

The League of Nations played no role in this crisis.
