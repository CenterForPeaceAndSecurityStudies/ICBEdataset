CRISNO 278

MAPAI SEIZURE

Background:

Rhodesian raids on guerrilla camps inside Mozambique caused a third crisis for that state from 29 May to 30 June 1977.

Summary:

On 29 May 1977 Rhodesia's military command announced that security forces, with air support, had entered southwest Mozambique and had overrun guerrilla bases. The attack triggered a crisis for Mozambique. The same day its minister of defense stated that the Rhodesian military operation had been directed at military installations. On 30 May, after more raids, Mozambique announced a counteroffensive. The following day the crisis escalated when the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces announced that troops had occupied the town of Mapai and were prepared to stay in Mozambique as long as necessary in order to destroy the ZANLA guerrillas in the area.

Rhodesia's actions drew strong condemnations from the international community. On 1 June UN Secretary-General Waldheim condemned Rhodesia, as did the U.S. and the U.K. Even South African Prime Minister Vorster issued a statement of concern that the Rhodesian action would lead to increased communist (Cuban) activity in southern Africa.

Rhodesia's troops withdrew from Mapai on 1-2 June, but the tension level remained high. On 18 June Mozambique's President Machel accused Rhodesia of waging open warfare against his country and requested a meeting of the UN Security Council. The Council passed a resolution at the end of June condemning Rhodesia for aggression against Mozambique. The resolution also requested immediate and substantial material assistance to enable Mozambique to strengthen its defense capability in order to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution, on 30 June, ended Mozambique's crisis. There was no USSR involvement.
