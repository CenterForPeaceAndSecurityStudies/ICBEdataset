CRISNO 117

CUBA-DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Background:

This Caribbean crisis had only one actor, the Dominican Republic, and lasted from 26 July until 28 September 1947.

Background President Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic since 1930, had seized control of all the instruments of power (army, courts, press, economy) and had crushed all opposition. The result was a large number of political exiles from the Dominican Republic seeking shelter in neighboring states such as Cuba and Guatemala. They in turn were joined by exiles, mercenaries, adventurers, and criminals from other states in the region. This group was known as the "Caribbean League."

These states, with Cuba the most supportive, supplied weapons, training, bases, and money, as well as ideological support, to the League's activities.

The crisis, therefore, was the result of a military threat to the Trujillo regime by the Caribbean League, with Cuba taking the lead. The exiles began gathering at Cayo Conlites (Cuba) as early as January 1946, with the Cuban government providing training and support.

Summary:

By 26 July 1947 the Trujillo regime perceived the exiles to be a serious military threat. Dominican precautions in the form of blackouts were instituted on that day. The Dominican Republic's major response occurred on 18 August when Trujillo voiced the possibility of war breaking out and suggested setting up an international commission to investigate the matter. The Dominican armed forces were put on alert. On 28 September the Cubans disbanded the revolutionary forces at the same time as the U.S. began to be negatively involved--prohibiting the purchase of U.S. weapons. The immediate threat subsided, but the conflict was to continue for several more years, with later involvement of the OAS; and a crisis erupted in 1949 (see Case #130--Luperon).

The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.
