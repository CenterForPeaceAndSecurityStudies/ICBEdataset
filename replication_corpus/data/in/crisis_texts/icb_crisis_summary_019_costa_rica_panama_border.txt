CRISNO 19

COSTA RICA-PANAMA BORDER

Background:

A crisis between Panama and Costa Rica over disputed territory lasted from 21 February to 24 August 1921.

Background Costa Rica and Panama (and earlier, Colombia, which held sovereignty over Panama until 1903) had long claimed title to the territory of Pueblo Nuevo de Coto along their common border. Numerous efforts to settle the boundary dispute, in 1825, 1856, 1865, 1876, 1880, and 1886, had failed. The most recent attempt, the White (arbitration) Award of 1914, ruled in favor of Costa Rica. Panama continued to occupy the territory claiming that U.S. Supreme Court Justice White had exceeded his authority. And for six years Costa Rica did not act to implement the White Award.

Summary:

The status quo changed drastically on 21 February 1921: Costa Rican forces unexpectedly occupied a village in the de Coto region triggering a crisis for Panama. On the 27th Panamanian police struck back creating a crisis for Costa Rica. Minor clashes ensued for several days. On the 28th U.S. Secretary of State Hughes warned both states not to use violence to solve the dispute. Secretary-General Drummond of the League of Nations initiated a fact-finding inquiry into the dispute on the 28th. On 2 March Panama appealed to the League to punish Costa Rica for sending troops into the disputed area. On the 4th the League Council called on the foreign ministers of the disputants to adhere to their obligations as League members. On the 7th-8th Costa Rica, then Panama, agreed to suspend hostilities. The U.S. offered to arbitrate on 16 March and warned Panama that the U.S. would enforce the White Award, if necessary. To indicate its resolve a battalion of U.S. marines was dispatched to the Canal Zone. Panama continued to reject the White Award--which Costa Rica had accepted from its inception--until 24 August 1921 when, under the threat of U.S. military intervention, it relented and set in motion withdrawal from the disputed territory thereby terminating the crisis.

The Pan American Union was not involved in this Central American crisis.

(Costa Rica regained formal possession of the de Coto region on 9 September. An international commission was later established to resolve residual land disputes but Panama refused to participate.)
