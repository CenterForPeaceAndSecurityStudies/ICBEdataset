CRISNO 194

CHINA-INDIA BORDER II

Background:

A second border crisis between India and China, leading to full-scale war, began on 8 September 1962 and ended on 23 January 1963.

Background Border clashes between India and China erupted into an international crisis in August 1959 (see Case #171--China/India Border I). From 1960 to 1962 the dispute continued at a lower level of intensity until Chinese forces began to take control of more disputed territory in the Aksai Chin region, in the western sector. India demanded a return to the status quo ante as a condition for negotiations. The PRC refused and began to concentrate military forces on the northeast (NEFA) border. India continued with its "Forward Policy" in which military patrols attempted to establish posts in territories held or claimed by the Chinese.

Summary:

On 8 September 1962 Chinese forces crossed the Thag La Ridge on the McMahon Line, triggering India's perception of a threat to its territorial integrity, with a limited time to respond militarily due to the imminent approach of winter.

The following day India began to plan "Operation Leghorn" to bring about the eviction of the Chinese. The beginning of its implementation on 4 October triggered a crisis for China, which perceived an imminent Indian military campaign beyond border incidents. On the same day China informed the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Beijing of India's plans. The PRC responded on 20 October with a massive simultaneous attack on the western and eastern sectors of the disputed frontier. That day Nehru received a letter from Khrushchev expressing concern at reports that India intended to settle the dispute militarily, warning of the inherent dangers and urging India to accept the Chinese proposals for talks. India's major response, on 24 October, was to take up the military option and to reject the PRC suggestion for mutual withdrawal to the 7 November 1959 "line of actual control," which would leave China in control of large tracts of disputed territory. On 29 October the U.S. ambassador in New Delhi offered U.S. military aid to India. So too did the U.K.

An intrawar crisis for India was triggered on 16 November with a second Chinese offensive. On the 19th Nehru appealed to President Kennedy to dispatch immediately 15 bomber and fighter squadrons to provide air cover for Indian cities against an anticipated Chinese attack. A U.S. aircraft carrier was ordered to leave its base in the Pacific and head toward the Bay of Bengal. Shortly thereafter the defeat of the Indian army was completed.

The crisis ended for China on 21 November when the PRC announced a unilateral cease-fire and, from 1 December, a withdrawal of Chinese forces 20 kilometers behind the actual control lines of 7 November 1959, in both the Aksai Chin (western sector) and the McMahon Line (eastern sector). That withdrawal date terminated India's IWC--but not yet its crisis as a whole.

Six Asian and African nonaligned states (Burma, Ceylon [Sri Lanka], Indonesia, Cambodia, Ghana, and the UAR [Egypt]) attempted mediation at the Colombo Conference during 10-12 December 1962. Sirimavo Ratwatte Bandaranaike, Prime Minister of Ceylon, led the mediation team’s efforts. By the time India's Lok Sabha approved their proposals, on 23 January, the PRC had implemented its unilateral withdrawal, a de facto cease-fire was in place, and the crisis ended for India.

Australia, Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. sent aircraft and other military equipment to India. The USSR and Pakistan were peripherally involved.

(On 29 November 1996, 34 years after their border war, the presidents of India and China renounced the use of force to solve their territorial dispute, by pledging that "neither side shall use its military capability against the other."

They also announced an agreement in principle on mutual withdrawal of forces from disputed areas along their 2,500 mile frontier, though details were deferred to further negotiations. It was a step toward resolution of the conflict between the world's two most populous states but less than final termination.)

The UN was not involved in this crisis.
