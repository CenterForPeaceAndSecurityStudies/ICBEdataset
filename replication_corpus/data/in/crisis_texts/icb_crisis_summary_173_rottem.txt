CRISNO 173

ROTTEM

Background:

A crisis for Egypt and Israel occurred between 15 February and 8 March 1960.

Background Acts of terror in Israel by infiltrators crossing the border from Syria, and a subsequent Israeli retaliation raid in early February 1960, preceded this crisis. At that time Egypt and Syria constituted a single political entity, the United Arab Republic (UAR) (see Case #162--Formation of UAR, in 1958, in Middle East: Non-PCs).

Summary:

On 15 February 1960 President Nasir received a message from the Soviet embassy in Cairo claiming that Israel's troops were massing on its northern border, with an intention to attack Syria. In order to offset this danger, Egypt began secret troop maneuvers across the Suez Canal in Sinai toward the Israeli border, on the 19th. On 23 February Israeli intelligence notified Prime Minister (and Minister of Defense) Ben Gurion that the major part of the Egyptian army had crossed the Canal and was situated near Israel's southern border. This triggered a crisis for Israel. The following day Israel responded by moving its forces southward in army maneuvers, termed Rottem by the Israel Defense Forces. Egypt's crisis ended on 1 March 1960 when its forces began to return to their bases west of the Canal. Israel reciprocated soon after. And, one week later, on 8 March, Israel's prime minister departed for an official visit to the United States. This act indicated a reduction of tension and the end of Israel's crisis.

The Soviet Union was politically involved in support of Egypt (the UAR). The U.S. and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
