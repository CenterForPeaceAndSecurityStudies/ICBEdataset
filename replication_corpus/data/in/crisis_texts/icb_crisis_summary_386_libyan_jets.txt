CRISNO 386

LIBYAN JETS

Background:

The United States and Libya were engaged in a brief, dramatic crisis from 21 December 1988 to 12 January 1989.

Background During the 1980s there were several violent incidents between Libya and the U.S., including two crises over the Gulf of Syrte (Sidra) (see Cases #330 and #363). Tension flared again at the end of 1988.

Summary:

A crisis for the U.S. was triggered by the crash of a Pan American plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988: Libya was the prime suspect in the explosion that caused the deaths of 257 passengers, most of them U.S. citizens. This dramatic catalyst was reinforced by U.S. intelligence reports that Libya had embarked on the production of chemical weapons at a plant near Rabta, 60 kilometers south of the capital, Tripoli. U.S. sanctions were imposed on Libya on 28 December.

At the beginning of 1989 a U.S. task force, headed by the aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy, was holding maneuvers in the central Mediterranean, near Libya. On 4 January two Libyan MIG-23s were shot down by two U.S. fighters over international waters, 110 kilometers from the Libyan coast, triggering a crisis for Libya.

The reaction in the international community was widespread criticism of U.S. actions. On 5 January the USSR, Libya's patron and arms supplier for a decade, accused the U.S. of "state terrorism" and "political adventurism." That day, too, only a U.K. veto saved the U.S. from an embarrassing European Community statement that failed to support the U.S. version of events. On 11 January a draft UN Security Council resolution deplored U.S. acts and called on the U.S. to suspend its military maneuvers off Libya's coast: the resolution was vetoed by France, the U.K., and the U.S. And the next day an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Islamic Conference condemned U.S. aggression. A visible decline in tension between Libya and the U.S. from that day marked the end of their third crisis in the 1980s.
