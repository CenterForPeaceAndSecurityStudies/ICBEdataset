CRISNO 200

CUBA-VENEZUELA

Background:

The duration of Venezuela's crisis with Cuba was one month, from 1 November to 1 December 1963.

Pre-crisis During 1963 Venezuela's internal situation began to verge on civil war. There was a marked increase in communist guerrilla attacks on major targets within Caracas itself. President Betancourt had announced emergency legislation against Venezuela's left-wing parties and ordered the arrest of leading communists, following an assassination attempt. Betancourt's drive against the Left on the domestic scene was matched by attempts in his foreign policy to isolate Cuba and invoke OAS sanctions against the Castro regime. This policy was actively encouraged by the U.S. Presidential elections in Venezuela were scheduled for 1 December 1963.

Summary:

On 1 November 1963 the Venezuelan government discovered a significant arms cache on the Paraguana Peninsula, one of Venezuela's quiet, secluded beaches. A plan of operation to capture Caracas and prevent the elections of 1 December was also discovered. On 29 November the Cuban origin of the arms was confirmed. Venezuela took the matter to the OAS Council for action under Article 6 of the Rio Treaty. The crisis ended on 1 December with the successful conclusion of Venezuela's presidential election.

The UN and the USSR were not involved in this crisis.

(The OAS agreed to investigate Venezuela's charges on 3 December, after the termination of Venezuela's crisis: in February 1964 it supported Venezuela's charges against Cuba but did not call for sanctions against Cuba which, by that time, was no longer a member of the regional organization of the Americas.)
