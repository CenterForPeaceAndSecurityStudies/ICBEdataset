CRISNO 17

VILNA I

Background:

A crisis between Poland and Lithuania over the long-disputed city of Vilna lasted from 12 July until 29 November 1920.

Pre-crisis Bolshevik forces captured Vilna on 5 January 1919 but lost it to the Poles on 4 April. On 8 December 1919 the Allied powers fixed the Polish/Lithuanian boundary (the "Curzon Line") leaving Vilna in Lithuania. A closely-related crisis between Poland and Russia had begun in April 1920 (see Case #13--Polish/Russian War, in Poland/Russia PC).

Summary:

Russo/Lithuanian hostilities (1919-20) ended with the Treaty of Moscow on 12 July 1920. The Bolshevik regime, then at war with Poland, recognized Lithuania including Vilna. In return, the Russians were allowed to cross Lithuanian territory to engage the Poles. That provision triggered a crisis for Poland. It responded two days later with an attack on Lithuanian forces near Vilna triggering a crisis for Lithuania. Full-scale war continued through the summer.

Poland appealed to the League of Nations on 5 September. Mediation by the League Council began on 16 September and led to an agreement on the 20th providing for a cease-fire and for Lithuania's neutrality in the Polish/Russian War; Vilna remained part of Lithuania. The (abortive) Treaty of Suwalki, incorporating these terms, was signed on 7 October.

Hours later Polish General Zeligowski crossed the frontier and occupied Vilna on the 9th. However, his attempts at further expansion into the Lithuanian heartland failed. Further mediation by the League of Nations led indirectly to a mutually accepted Protocol on 29 November 1920 calling for a plebiscite to decide the fate of Vilna. This agreement brought hostilities--and the Vilna I crisis--to an end.

Russia was highly involved in this crisis, providing direct military aid to Lithuania; and it was ultimately responsible for Poland's military failure in this international crisis.

(The Vilna plebiscite -- arranged with the aid of the League of Nations and held on 8 January 1922 under Zeligowski's supervision -- showed, not surprisingly, a majority in favor of union with Poland. That status was formalized on 18 April. Lithuania rejected the outcome and severed relations with Poland. So it remained until 1927, following the Vilna II crisis [see Case #36].)
