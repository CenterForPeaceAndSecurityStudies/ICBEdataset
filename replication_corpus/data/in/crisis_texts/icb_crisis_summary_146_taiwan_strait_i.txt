CRISNO 146

TAIWAN STRAIT I

Background:

There were three crisis actors in the first international crisis over the Taiwan Strait: the People's Republic of China (PRC), Nationalist China (Republic of China [ROC] or Taiwan), and the United States. The crisis began in early August 1954 and ended on 23 April 1955.

Background The conflict over the Taiwan Strait began in 1949 after the Communist victory in China's civil war and the split between the PRC and the Nationalists on Taiwan (see Case #125). Neither side was content with this arrangement: each aimed at reunification, with the PRC advocating a Communist regime while Chiang Kai-shek wished to see the Mao Tse-tung-led government removed from the mainland.

Summary:

A crisis for the PRC was triggered in early August 1954 by fear of the impending creation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). It was formally established on 8 September. Zhou Enlai denounced SEATO in a speech on 11 August in which he emphasized the justice of any Communist attempt to reunify China. On 3 September 1954 the PRC bombarded the Nationalist-held offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu. This triggered a crisis for the United States and Taiwan. Nationalist China's response, on 7 September, took the form of air strikes against the Chinese mainland. On the 12th the U.S. responded by deciding to send the Seventh Fleet to the area and appealing to the UN. On 2 December 1954 a defense treaty was signed between the U.S. and Taiwan, by which time the PRC had ceased the bombardment, ending Taiwan's first crisis.

The signing of a U.S.-Taiwan Defense Pact on 2 December 1954 escalated the crisis for the PRC. Its response, on 10 January 1955, was heavy bombardment of the Tachen Islands. This, in turn, triggered a second crisis for Taiwan. The latter responded some time in January 1955 by returning fire and staging battles on the three islands of Tachen, Quemoy, and Matsu. Taiwan subsequently evacuated the Tachen Islands. The U.S. responded to the escalation of the crisis with a request by President Eisenhower to Congress on 24 January to grant him a free hand in controlling the situation in the Taiwan area. The termination of Taiwan's second crisis occurred on 25 March 1955, after completion of the fortification of Quemoy and Matsu, with U.S. help. The crisis for the U.S. and the PRC ended on 23 April 1955 when Zhou Enlai offered to negotiate in the face of an increasing U.S. commitment and the reduced prospects for a successful PRC invasion. Taiwan did not participate in the talks.

During the course of the first Taiwan Strait crisis there was a shift from the plane of Communist-Nationalist confrontation to primary interaction between the PRC and the U.S. United States strategy was directed at building an alliance network of anti-communist states. The Secretary-General of the UN conducted talks, as did the Security Council, but no resolution was passed; and the UN had no effect on the abatement of the crisis. Although the formation of SEATO was the trigger to the crisis, that regional organization was entirely inactive during the crisis. The USSR was marginally involved during this crisis.

In 1958 the same three states experienced another crisis over the issue of Quemoy and Matsu (see Case #166).
