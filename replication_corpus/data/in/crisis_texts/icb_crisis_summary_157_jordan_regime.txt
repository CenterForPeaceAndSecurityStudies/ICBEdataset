CRISNO 157

JORDAN REGIME

Background:

A crisis over a threat to the regime of King Hussein occurred from 4 April to 3 May 1957.

Background and Pre-crisis In October 1956 leftist nationalist parties won the parliamentary elections in Jordan, making Suleiman al-Nabulsi Prime Minister. Jordan joined a military alliance with Egypt, Syria, and Sa'udi Arabia. The treaty between the U.K. and Jordan was annulled in March 1957, and diplomatic relations were established with the USSR, which included the acceptance of an offer of Soviet aid. The British commander of Jordan's Arab Legion, Glubb Pasha, was dismissed and was replaced by General Ali Abu Nuwar, who favored closer ties with Nasirist Egypt. His country's increasingly rapid movements toward the Left alarmed King Hussein. The United States became concerned about a possible threat to the independence of Jordan and to the pro-Western regional alliance system established by the Baghdad Pact (see Case #148).

Summary:

The trigger to Jordan's crisis was an attempt on 4 April to overthrow the king. Hussein, perceiving a threat to his regime, accused Egypt and Syria of aiding anti-Hussein elements within Jordan. On 10 April King Hussein responded by dismissing the entire leftist cabinet. Riots and demonstrations followed but were controlled by suppressing all the political parties. Ali Abu Nuwar, the Chief of Staff, was dismissed, and the king succeeded in persuading army officers to support him. The United States, as well as Sa'udi Arabia, came to the king's assistance with military and economic aid. Units of the U.S.'s Sixth Fleet were sent to the eastern Mediterranean, and their departure, on 3 May 1957, indicated that the crisis for the Hashemite Kingdom seemed to have ended.

The Soviet Union covertly supported the anti-Hussein plot. The UN was not involved in this crisis.
