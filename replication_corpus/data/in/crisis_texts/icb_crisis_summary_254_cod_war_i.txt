CRISNO 254

COD WAR I

Background:

The first crisis between the U.K. and Iceland over cod fishing rights began on 14 May and ended on 13 November 1973.

Background and Pre-crisis In 1972 a dispute between Iceland, on the one hand, and Britain and West Germany, on the other, centered around Iceland's unilateral extension of its territorial waters from a 12-mile limit to 50 miles. This severely curtailed the fish catch available to other countries. Several incidents occurred as a result of the harassment of British and West German trawlers by Icelandic gunboats. Further incidents of ramming and exchanges of fire were reported in March and April 1973.

Summary:

On the night of 14 May 1973 Icelandic gunboats fired on British trawlers, triggering a crisis for the U.K. On the 16th British fishers threatened to leave the disputed waters if protection were not assured. London responded on 19 May by dispatching Royal Navy ships to Icelandic waters, triggering a crisis for Iceland. The following day, Iceland banned RAF aircraft from landing at the Keflavik NATO base, while protesting to the U.K. Talks between the two prime ministers began on 2 October. On 13 November 1973 the parliament of Iceland approved an agreement whereby Iceland set aside certain areas within the newly accepted 50-mile limit for British fishers, terminating the crisis for both actors.

Two regional/security organizations, NATO and the Council of Europe, were involved, but neither was effective in abating the crisis. The U.S. limited its involvement to a statement about the dispute. A proposal for mediation came from Norway. USSR involvement was more substantial, however. Continued NATO use of the Keflavik air base, which was necessary for the implementation of important NATO antisubmarine warfare operations, was already an issue in Icelandic politics. Iceland's request to the USSR for a show of force during the crisis was answered by a special Soviet naval exercise: 10 Russian ships and 10 submarines were dispatched as a signal to the U.K. There was also a reported request from Iceland to the Soviet Union for a gunboat to strengthen Iceland's coast guard.

A second Cod War crisis occurred between Iceland and the U.K. in 1975-76 (see Case #263).

The UN was not involved in this case.
