CRISNO 89

STALINGRAD

Background:

The USSR and Germany were enmeshed in a turning-point intrawar crisis (IWC) over Stalingrad from 28 June 1942 to 2 February 1943.

Background The city of Stalingrad was one of the three strategic prizes of the German military campaign that began with "Operation Barbarossa" on 22 June 1941 (see Case #85), along with Moscow and Leningrad. The former Volgograd, renamed in honor of the ruler of the Soviet Union, was cut off from its hinterland, both in the north and the south, in July 1942.

Summary:

On 28 June 1942 German forces launched another major offensive in the east, triggering an IWC for the Soviet Union. At stake was the entire southern part of the eastern front, with the vast oil resources of the Caucasus at risk. On 28 July Stalin, by his Special Order 227, recognized that the city of Stalingrad, too, was a major objective of the German campaign. That military offensive appeared on the point of succeeding, but the Wehrmacht had overstretched its lines.

Seizing the opportunity created by the vulnerability of German forces, the Red Army launched a massive counteroffensive northwest and southeast of Stalingrad on 19 November, aimed at encircling the city and crushing the German Sixth Army. This triggered what was to become the gravest IWC for Germany during World War II--until the D-Day offensive in the West in 1944 (see Case #94).

The following day Hitler issued a personal order to the commander of the Sixth Army to stand fast no matter the cost. During the course of the Battle of Stalingrad this "no retreat" decision was repeated several times--after Field Marshal Manstein's request on 25 November to withdraw and General Zeitzler's similar appeal during December. The German operation to break out of its encirclement, "Winter Gale," began on 12 December but suffered defeat after defeat. Soviet forces recaptured Velikye-Luki on 1 January and entered Mozdok on the 3rd to relieve Leningrad from a 17-month siege. On 8 January 1943 the Soviets presented Hitler with an ultimatum to surrender at Stalingrad: it was refused.

On the 10th, the last phase of the Battle of Stalingrad began with an enormous Soviet artillery bombardment. Another Soviet demand for the surrender of German forces was made on the 24th, again refused by Hitler. On 31 January Soviet forces captured Field Marshal von Paulus, the commander of German forces at Stalingrad. Twenty-two German divisions were cut off and reduced to 80,000 men. They were forced to capitulate on 2 February 1943, ending Germany's Stalingrad crisis in disastrous defeat: the Germans and their Axis allies lost more than half a million soldiers, killed or captured. The Soviet IWC ended the same day in resounding triumph. The tide of battle in the "Great Patriotic War" was changed irrevocably, as Soviet armies began the long march through German-occupied eastern Europe, culminating in the occupation of Berlin in May 1945.
