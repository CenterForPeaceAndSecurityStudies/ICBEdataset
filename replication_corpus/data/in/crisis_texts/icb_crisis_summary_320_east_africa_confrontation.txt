CRISNO 320

EAST AFRICA CONFRONTATION

Background:

Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya experienced a crisis over territory from 5 December 1980 until 29 June 1981.

Pre-crisis In 1980 two Somali offensives tried--but failed--to take control of Ogaden.

Summary:

On 5 December 1980 Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi and Ethiopia's ruler, Mengistu Mariam, called on Somalia to renounce all territorial claims against Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Tanzania--and to pay reparations for damage caused to Ethiopia in its full-scale attack on Ogaden in 1977 (see Case #282--Ogaden II). This demand, the culmination of an Ethiopian diplomatic offensive against the U.S.-Somalia military assistance agreement of July 1980, triggered a crisis for Somalia, which perceived it as a declaration of war: it feared having to defend its borders with Ethiopia and Kenya simultaneously.

Somalia responded two days later: a joint declaration by all of its governing institutions--the Supreme Revolutionary Council, the Central Committee of the ruling Somalia Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Council of Ministers, and the People's Assembly--called on the Somali people to defend their national rights. This was perceived as a declaration of war by Kenya and Ethiopia, triggering crises for them.

Despite the intense hostility and the danger of war--ever-present in the prolonged struggle for control over Ogaden and other Somali-claimed territories, there was no violence during the ensuing months. Crisis termination was signaled by a formal agreement for cooperation between President Barr√© of Somalia and President Moi of Kenya on 29 June 1981.

The OAU reiterated its opposition to Somali territorial claims in August 1980. Neither of the patron states, the U.S. and the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
