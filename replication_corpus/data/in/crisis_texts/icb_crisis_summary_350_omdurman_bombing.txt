CRISNO 350

OMDURMAN BOMBING

Background:

Sudan, Egypt, and Libya were the direct participants in a brief crisis, beginning on 16 March 1984; the crisis faded.

Background Throughout its lengthy tenure (1969-85) the Numeiri military regime in Sudan viewed Libya and Ethiopia, aided by the USSR, as engaged in persistent subversion to undermine its hold on power in Khartoum. On two previous occasions Libya's acts and Sudan's perceptions led to international crises (see Cases #340 and #346).

Summary:

On 16 March 1984 a sole Tupolev (TU-22) bomber attacked the twin city of Sudan's capital, Omdurman. This triggered a crisis for Sudan--and Egypt, the latter because of its commitments under their 1976 mutual defense agreement. On the 17th Sudan's military regime immediately placed its armed forces on alert. The same day Egypt dispatched senior army officers to Khartoum as a signal of its concern and support. Both accused Libya of responsibility for the raid, a charge that it denied.

In response to a request by Sudan and Egypt the U.S. dispatched two AWACS surveillance aircraft on 18 March, triggering a crisis for Libya. Four days later Libya requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which met on 27-28 March. As in February 1983 (see Case #340), Sudan accused Libya of the raid and, more generally, of intervention in its affairs; and Libya charged the U.S. with acts of aggression. As in the earlier crisis, too, President Mubarak of Egypt went to Khartoum on 25 March in a gesture of solidarity with the Numeiri regime. Thousands of Egyptian soldiers were by then deployed in Sudan. No finite end to this crisis can be identified.

The U.S., as noted, actively supported Sudan and Egypt. The USSR provided passive backing to Libya. The UN did not play an active role in crisis management. And the two regional organizations, the OAU and the Arab League, remained aloof.
