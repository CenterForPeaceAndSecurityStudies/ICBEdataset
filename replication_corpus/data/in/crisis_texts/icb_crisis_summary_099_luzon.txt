CRISNO 99

LUZON

Background:

Following the American victory at Leyte, the U.S. invasion of Luzon created another IWC for Japan from 9 January to 3 March 1945.

Pre-crisis After the defeat at Leyte, Japan's political and military leaders concentrated their hopes for victory on Luzon. As the situation deteriorated in the Philippines, the emperor called a meeting of the Jushin (senior statesmen) on 6 January 1945 to seek their advice on the future course. While the Japanese military had already lost the war, some of the Jushin advised, Japan's spirit could not be destroyed. For want of a better solution, they now proposed a concentration of forces against the U.S. in the hope that a victorious battle would permit Japan to end the war on more favorable terms.

Summary:

On 9 January two corps of the U.S. Sixth Army invaded Luzon, triggering a new crisis for Japan. They had gained an element of surprise by selecting an undesirable part of the coastline for landing. A combination of artillery, air bombardment, and the dogged advance of the U.S. infantry gradually led to progress. Although the Japanese forces were cut off from retreat in Manila, they continued to refuse to surrender. Other U.S. forces sought to secure Manila Bay. Finally, on 3 March, the American occupation of Manila was completed, terminating this crisis for Japan.
