CRISNO 359

BURKINA FASO-MALI BORDER

Background:

Mali and Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, experienced a second crisis over the Agacher Strip from 20 December 1985 to 18 January 1986.

Background and Pre-crisis The Agacher area between these two West African states, reputewdly rich in minerals, was in dispute since both were granted independence by France in 1960. In 1979 the parties agreed on procedures to resolve their dispute. By September 1985 a joint border commission had succeeded in demarcating 1,000 kilometers of their common border. However, relations became badly strained a month earlier when Burkina Faso expelled the Secretary-General of the Francophone West African Economic Community, a Malian, because he criticized the President of Burkina Faso. (Captain Thomas Sankara, who became President of Upper Volta in 1983, changed its name to Burkina Faso in 1984.)

Summary:

The crisis trigger was a non-violent act by Burkina Faso around 20 December 1985--an attempt to conduct a census in the Agacher region under police guard. This led to violent incidents, which escalated on the 25th, when Mali troops attacked towns within the disputed area. Burkina Faso planes and soldiers penetrated deep into Mali territory on the 26th. Four days of serious clashes left an estimated 400 persons dead. A cease-fire was achieved on the 30th through Nigerian and Libyan mediation under OAU auspices and took effect the next day, monitored by a small (16-person) Observer Group from the states of the Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement and Benin. Moreover, the parties, who had agreed in principle to submit the border dispute to the International Court of Justice in September 1983, did so in December 1985.

Crisis termination was achieved at a multistate conference in the Ivory Coast on 17-18 January: the two protagonists agreed to withdraw their forces from the disputed territory, thereby terminating the crisis.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR was involved in this crisis. The OAU, as noted, played an indirect mediating role. The UN Secretary-General appealed to the two parties on 27 December 1985 to exercise maximum restraint; and he offered good offices to the OAU.
