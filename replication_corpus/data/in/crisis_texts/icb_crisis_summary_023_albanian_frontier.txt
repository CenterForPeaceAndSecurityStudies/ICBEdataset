CRISNO 23

ALBANIAN FRONTIER

Background:

Albania and Yugoslavia were enmeshed in a crisis over territory from 7 July to 18 November 1921.

Pre-crisis In April and June 1921 Albania appealed to the League of Nations to delimit its frontiers. Greece and Yugoslavia sought to forestall this process because of their own territorial ambitions vis-Ã -vis Albania. Minor skirmishes occurred between Albanian and Yugoslav forces.

Summary:

In the first week of July 1921, around the 7th, Yugoslav troops occupied previously demilitarized territory triggering a crisis for Albania. As early as 13 July Yugoslav officials expressed their anticipation of an Albanian attack, triggering a crisis for Belgrade. It came on 9 August, when Albanian forces occupied Yugoslav territory. Full-scale war ensued and continued until November.

Under the authority of the League of Nations, the Conference of Ambassadors, then comprising Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, and the U.K., defined the Albania/Yugoslavia border in mid-November 1921. Moreover, the U.K. attempted, unsuccessfully, to invoke Article XVI of the League Covenant with a call for military action against Yugoslavia. The latter development accentuated Yugoslavia's perception of a potential grave military threat by the major powers. Together these two events had a positive impact: on 18 November 1921 the Albanian and Yugoslav representatives to the League accepted the border delimitation and pledged friendly relations. Albania was formally recognized. Their crisis was resolved.

Yugoslavia, which still controlled the northern part of Albania, withdrew its forces in 1921 under pressure from the League.

The most highly involved actors were the League of Nations Council and the U.K. Greece and Romania issued statements during the crisis. Albania misperceived Russian military involvement in support of Yugoslavia.
