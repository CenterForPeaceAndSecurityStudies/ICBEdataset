CRISNO 39

MUKDEN INCIDENT

Background:

A crisis for both China and Japan began on 18 September 1931 and ended on 18 February 1932.

Pre-crisis On 5 May 1931 a People's National Convention in Nanking adopted a provisional constitution that confirmed the separation of five branches within the Chinese government. Chinese nationalism had penetrated into China's three northeastern provinces, and authority in all of China was fragmented.

Unrest and dissatisfaction with economic conditions in Japan were marked by 1930: the military, while opposing the alliance between government and business, began to assume control. Strong pressure was brought to bear on the government to act positively in defense of Japanese interests in Manchuria, threatened by the policies of the Chinese nationalists. Manchuria was perceived, in part, as an economic panacea.

Summary:

On the night of 18 September 1931 the Japanese Kwantung Army, engaged in night maneuvers at Mukden, used an explosion on the railway as an excuse for the preconceived seizure, before morning, of the arsenal and of Antung, Yingkow, and Changchun. This triggered a crisis for China and also for the Japanese government--the invasion being an act by the Japanese army without previous sanction by the civil authority, which was not interested at that time in war with China. China had no choice but to withdraw after serious clashes. On 21 September Kirin was seized. The same day, China appealed to the League of Nations and to the U.S. for aid. No serious military response was attempted. On the 24th the Japanese government called for direct Sino/Japanese negotiations, while rejecting involvement by the League. At the same time Japanese military pressure continued, and the northeastern provinces of China were steadily occupied. The Chinese instituted a boycott of Japanese imports into the country.

The crisis ended for Japan and, by force majeure, for China on 18 February 1932, when Japan unilaterally declared the independence of Manchuria, now called Manchukuo. (China did not regain Manchuria until the end of World War II.) The League of Nations adopted a resolution on 10 December 1931 to dispatch a fact-finding mission.

(After the end of the crisis the Lytton Commission gently chided Japan: it found that the Japanese action of 18-19 September 1931 was not in self-defense and that the creation of Manchukuo did not flow from a "genuine and spontaneous independence movement." The Commission's criticism of Japan's behavior was adopted by the League Assembly, leading to Japan's notice of withdrawal from the League in February 1933.)

The United States condemned Japan's behavior but confined its action to nonrecognition of Manchukuo. Japan viewed the U.S. with hostility and suspicion, while China was dissatisfied with the paucity of the U.S. response. The USSR proposed a nonaggression pact to Japan. Territory previously recognized by Japan to be in the Soviet sphere of influence was now included in Manchukuo as the new state expanded its borders; but Moscow assumed Chinese rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway, which proved to be a continuing source of friction. The U.K. was modestly involved.
