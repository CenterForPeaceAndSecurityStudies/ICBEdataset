CRISNO 185

BERLIN WALL

Background:

The last Cold War crisis over Berlin was of direct concern to six actors: the DDR (East Germany), the USSR, France, the U.K., the FRG (West Germany), and the U.S. It began early in August and ended on 28 October 1961.

Background Soon after the end of World War II in Europe the U.S., the U.K., and France became parties to an uneasy agreement with the Soviet Union regarding the administration of Germany and its capital, Berlin: the Potsdam Agreement of 2 August 1945 partitioned Berlin (and Germany) into four zones of occupation; an Allied Control Council, representing the Four Powers, was to serve as an overall supervisory body. Acute crises between the Western powers and the Soviet Union occurred in 1948-49 and 1958-59 (see Cases #123--Berlin Blockade, and #168--Berlin Deadline). (The East German Uprising [see Case #141, in Europe: Non-PCs] was an intra-Soviet-bloc crisis.)

Pre-crisis In October 1960 the Soviet leader, Khrushchev, after canceling the Paris summit meeting with President Eisenhower over the U-2 affair, set the end of 1961 as the deadline for the signing of a German peace treaty, in the absence of which the USSR would sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. President Kennedy's meeting with Khrushchev in Vienna on 3-4 June 1961 made no progress on Berlin. On returning to Moscow, Khrushchev repeated his ultimatum, while Kennedy announced to the American people that the U.S. would fight to defend its rights in Berlin and the freedom of West Berliners. He also called up military reserve units.

Summary:

A crisis for the DDR and the USSR crystallized at the beginning of August 1961: by that time the flow of East German refugees to the West had reached alarming proportions--100,000 during the first half of the year, including 20,000 in June, which rose to 30,000 in July. Under growing pressure from the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, and the specter of an impending collapse of communist power in the DDR, Khrushchev, just before a Communist-bloc summit meeting in Moscow on 3-5 August, authorized Ulbricht to erect a wall around West Berlin. The implementation of this decision on 13 August was the major response to the crisis by the USSR and the DDR. It, in turn, triggered a crisis for France, the U.K., West Germany, and the U.S. And it terminated East Germany's crisis because the wall ended the flow of refugees to the West.

West Germany responded on 16 August with a call from West Berlin's Mayor Willy Brandt to the West for effective action. An emergency session of the FRG parliament was held the next day. On the 17th and 18th the U.S., the U.K., and France responded by strengthening the Berlin garrison--1,500 U.S. troops were rushed to the city. On 22 August DDR forces announced the establishment of a no-man's land of 100 meters on each side of the Wall. West Berliners were warned to keep clear of that zone. Western forces began to patrol the area to the west while East German forces kept watch over their side.

The crisis ended for France, the U.K., and West Germany on 17 October when Khrushchev, at the Soviet 22nd Party Congress, withdrew his year-end deadline for the signing of a German peace treaty.

For the two superpowers the crisis lingered on another 11 days. A brief but ominous confrontation between U.S. and Soviet tanks from 25 to 28 October at "Checkpoint Charlie," the crossing point between the U.S. and the USSR sectors of Berlin, re-escalated the interbloc crisis. United States leaders perceived this incident as a test of U.S. resolve that was met successfully. Soviet leaders perceived it as a Western threat to penetrate the Wall and East Berlin. It was resolved by a tacit agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev on 28 October for a parallel withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet tanks from a potentially dangerous violent clash.

Both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization (WTO) were active in the crisis, each backing its own protagonists in the dispute. The UN was not involved in this crisis.

(The Western Allies and West Germany failed to demolish the Wall--that occurred spontaneously within East Germany in 1989; but they remained steadfast in maintaining their presence in Berlin. This resolve was communicated dramatically to the people of West Berlin by President Kennedy in his memorable "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech during his August 1963 visit to the city. A Four-Power agreement in 1971 stabilized the Berlin status quo for almost two decades. The conflict over Berlin remained unsolved until the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990.

The Soviet [and, after 1991, Russian] military presence in East Germany and Berlin lasted 49 years. More than half a million Russian troops and dependents were evacuated from 1991 to 1994. And the final symbolic withdrawal of the Four Powers' military contingents from Berlin occurred in August-September 1994.)
