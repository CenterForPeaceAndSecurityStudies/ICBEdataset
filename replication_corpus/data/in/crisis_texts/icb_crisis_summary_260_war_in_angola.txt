CRISNO 260

WAR IN ANGOLA

Background:

Zaire, Zambia, South Africa, Angola, Cuba, the Soviet Union, and the United States were direct participants in a crisis from 12 July 1975 until 27 March 1976.

Pre-crisis The Alvor Agreement, signed on 15 January 1975, formally granted independence to Angola, to take effect on 10 November 1975 after elections in October. A transitional government was to be composed of representatives of the following: the FNLA (the National Front for the Liberation of Angola), formed in 1957, supported by the U.S. and Zaire, with its power base in the Bakongo tribe of northern Angola; the marxist-oriented MPLA, supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba and popular in Angola's coastal urban areas, among intellectuals of the north-central Kimbundu tribe; and UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), formed in the mid-1960s, in a split from the FNLA--it had a strong popular base among the Ovimbundu tribe in the south and central rural areas and received support from South Africa and Zambia. There was to be a unified security force under a Portuguese high commissioner. The Alvor Agreement broke down as early as March 1975, with major fighting between the FNLA and the MPLA erupting in late April. Portugal declared martial law on 15 May. President Kenyatta of Kenya mediated a cease-fire on 21 June, but it was broken almost immediately.

Summary:

On 12 July 1975 Soviet-backed MPLA forces attacked the FNLA headquarters in the capital, Luanda, triggering a crisis for Zaire and Zambia when the essential Benguela railroad was closed down. Zaire began sending small-scale commando units into Angola in mid-July to assist the FNLA. By that time the Soviet Union had started providing massive aid to the MPLA, causing alarm in Zaire, Zambia, and South Africa, as well as in the United States, which had been providing covert aid to both the FNLA and the UNITA movements.

Zambia responded on 27 July with an appeal to the U.S. for aid. Hydroelectric power projects, built jointly by South Africa and Portugal, were located on the Kunene River bordering South-West Africa (later Namibia). Clashes between UNITA and MPLA forces began approaching the power projects on 8 August, triggering a crisis for South Africa, which sent small units of troops to the projects on the 11th and 12th. On the 15th the FNLA captured the major port of Lobito, triggering a crisis for the MPLA (Angola), Cuba, and the Soviet Union. Cuba and the USSR were concerned that South African intervention would result in the defeat of the MPLA in the struggle for power and influence in Angola. Cuba's response, on 20 August, was a decision to increase military aid to the MPLA (which was later to be recognized as the government of Angola). More South African troops were sent to the district capital on 21-22 August. On the 21st UNITA declared war on the MPLA, after concluding an alliance with the FNLA. On the 31st the USSR, too, increased its aid to Angola.

On 1 September the MPLA (Angola) responded with a major offensive that succeeded in reversing its losses, triggering a crisis for the United States. Cuban troops began to arrive on the 3rd. On 11 September Zaire sent two full battalions to strengthen the FNLA. President Mobutu approached the U.S. for aid and initiated diplomatic activity with other African states. The U.S. responded on 25 September with an increase of covert aid to Zaire, to be funneled to UNITA and the FNLA. President Ford requested that Congress increase emergency aid to Zaire.

South Africa's response to the escalating crisis was the dispatch of a strike force into Angola on 23 October 1975 to aid the FNLA/UNITA alliance. It was successful in recouping earlier losses. A further escalation for Zaire, Zambia, the U.S., and South Africa was catalyzed by the arrival of a large number of Cuban troops to fight alongside the MPLA, together with massive arms supplies to Angola from the Soviet Union. On 10 November the remaining Portuguese personnel were withdrawn from Angola. Both the MPLA and the FNLA/UNITA declared the independence of Angola. The former was recognized by the USSR, Soviet-bloc members, including Cuba, and some African states. The latter was never officially recognized.

The U.S. crisis ended on 19 December 1975, when Congress refused to grant aid to Zaire or to support the FNLA/UNITA. An earlier appeal by Secretary of State Kissinger to the NATO Foreign Ministers' Council for support to the FNLA/UNITA was also rejected. The crisis for Zambia ended after a MPLA victory had become more apparent: on 18 February 1976 Zambia announced that it would recognize the state of Angola but not the MPLA government. This was done on 22 February, after negotiations. The crisis for Angola, Cuba, and the USSR ended on 24 February after UNITA announced, on the 12th, its decision to retreat and revert to guerrilla warfare, followed by a similar FNLA announcement on the 24th. On 28 February Zaire announced its decision to recognize the Angola government, after talks between Mobutu and the MPLA head, Neto. South Africa, after extensive negotiations via British Foreign Secretary Callaghan and the Soviet ambassador to London, achieved MPLA guarantees for the security of the hydroelectric projects and the safety of the personnel there. On 27 March South Africa announced a complete troop withdrawal from Angola.

There was intense foreign involvement in the Angolan War. Cuba, the Soviet Union, Congo (Brazzaville), and Yugoslavia actively supported the MPLA, with Cuban forces directly engaged in combat. The United States, China, North Korea, and Zaire aided the FNLA; Zaire, in addition to extensive diplomatic activity, provided military bases on its territory. Zambia supported UNITA diplomatically. And Tanzania provided diplomatic support and port facilities for the unloading of Soviet arms for the MPLA. There was also diplomatic activity by the Ivory Coast, Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria.

The OAU used several procedures in an attempt to settle the conflict; all were unsuccessful. In January 1975 it supported the Alvor Accords. In July it called for a cease-fire and a National Unity Government for Angola. On 28 July, Idi Amin of Uganda was sworn in as the new Secretary-General of the OAU and immediately took on the duties of mediating the ongoing situation in Angola, submitting a proposal for a government of national unity between the MPLA, FNLA and UNITA. OAU conciliation commissions were sent to the area in July and October 1975. On 10-13 January 1976 the OAU held an emergency summit meeting on Angola that Amin had requested; it broke down on the 13th with members divided evenly on whether to recognize the PRA or call for a government of national unity. By 2 February 1976 a majority of OAU members had recognized the MPLA government, automatically extending OAU recognition. Angola was admitted to the OAU on 10 February. By 22 February 70 states, including members of the European Economic Community (EEC) (later the European Community [EC] and, since 1992, the European Union [EU]), had granted recognition.

The UN was less active. The good offices of Secretary-General Waldheim were used to relay MPLA guarantees to South Africa. The UN sent an inquiry and conciliation mission to Angola on 14 October 1975. On 10 March 1976 Kenya requested an emergency Security Council session on South Africa's "act of aggression." The Council met from 26 to 31 March; and, despite South Africa's claim that its troops had already left Angola, a resolution was passed condemning South Africa and demanding that it respect the territorial integrity of Angola, as well as that it cease the use of Pretoria-controlled South-West Africa (later, Namibia) for military incursions.

Washington had been supplying aid covertly to the FNLA since the Kennedy administration. In January 1975 an interagency National Security Task Force on Angola was formed. In December the State Department instructed the Gulf Oil Company to suspend the payment of $125 million in royalties to the MPLA-controlled Angolan finance ministry. During the Angola crisis there were widespread strikes and unemployment in the United States in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate. These legacies prompted Congress to decide to withdraw aid to Zaire, thereby extricating the U.S. from a major crisis in southern Africa.

Angola was viewed by both the Soviet Union and Africans as a watershed in American attitudes toward U.S. military intervention in the Third World. The initial Soviet position on Angola was to favor the right of all three rival Angolan movements to participate in the transitional government, but that posture changed early in 1975. Sino/Soviet rivalry was a major factor in Moscow's approach to the Angolan conflict. Soviet MIG-21s, tanks, and missiles were airlifted into Angola for the MPLA, and Soviet naval movements took place outside Angolan waters. With Cuban military assistance, Moscow was able to help its local ally, the MPLA, to establish itself as Angola's legitimate government.

(The FNLA and UNITA factions remained in control of large parts of Angola's territory--by 1979 UNITA controlled much of the southern third of Angola--and continued to pose a military challenge to MPLA and Cuban troops. The FNLA ceased to function as a separate force, but the civil war continued for 20 years. There were several abortive or short-lived cease-fire agreements and a comprehensive UN-brokered peace agreement between the MPLA-dominated government and UNITA in November 1994. However, a stable peace in Angola remains elusive.)
