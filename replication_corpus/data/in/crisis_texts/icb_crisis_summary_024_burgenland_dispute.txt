CRISNO 24

BURGENLAND DISPUTE

Background:

Hungary and Austria experienced a crisis over the disputed territory of Burgenland (German West Hungary) from 28 August until 28 December 1921.

Pre-crisis The treaties of St. Germain (10 September 1919) and Trianon (4 June 1920) had assigned the predominantly German-speaking area of Burgenland, only 15 miles from Vienna, to Austria. The date of the transfer from Hungary was fixed for 28 August 1921.

Summary:

Austrian police entered Burgenland that day, triggering a crisis for Hungary. In minor clashes they were rebuffed by regular and irregular Hungarian forces, triggering a crisis for Austria the same day. The next day its chancellor acknowledged the likelihood of more serious developments in Burgenland. Several days later Austria's government asserted that the peace of the republic was threatened.

Through the mediation of Italy, whose foreign minister, Torretta, used back-channel negotiations with Hungary, a plebiscite was incorporated in the Venice Protocol on 13 October. Austria, however, was dissatisfied with some of the provisions and ratified the Protocol only under pressure from the great powers. The plebiscite, held in December 1921, gave most of Burgenland--except Odenburg--to Austria and ended the crisis for both on 28 December.

Among the involved actors were three major powers, as noted: Italy mediated the Venice Protocol, which France and the U.K. pressed Austria to accept. Czechoslovakia's offer of mediation was declined by Austria.

The League of Nations, to which Austria appealed, was nonresponsive.
