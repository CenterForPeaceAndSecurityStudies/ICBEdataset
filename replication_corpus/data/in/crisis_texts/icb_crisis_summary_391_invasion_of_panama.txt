CRISNO 391

INVASION OF PANAMA

Background:

The United States and Panama were enmeshed in a military intervention crisis from 15 December 1989 to 3 January 1990.

Background Washington played the decisive role in carving a sovereign state of Panama from Venezuela in 1903--in return for Panama's acceptance of U.S. construction and permanent control of the Panama Canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This gave the U.S. an enduring strategic interest in the domestic and external affairs of a small state at the southern tip of Central America. U.S. ownership of the Panama Canal Zone "in perpetuity" attested to the U.S. perception of a vital interest.

The "loss" of the Canal Zone was deeply resented by Panama's political and military elites. That resentment was expressed during a brief January 1964 crisis triggered by the raising of the U.S. flag in the Canal Zone by U.S. students, in violation of a December 1963 banning of both states' flags at Canal Zone schools (see Case #206--Panama Flag crisis).

The U.S. and Panama agreed to renegotiate the 1903 treaties, after diplomatic relations were restored in April 1964. In June 1967 Presidents Johnson and Robles reached agreement on three treaties, but strong opposition prevented their consideration in, let alone ratification by, the U.S. Congress. General Omar Torrijos, who seized power in Panama in 1968, renounced the agreements. President Nixon resumed the negotiations in 1970, and a set of principles was agreed upon in 1974. Once more, strong opposition by right-wing Republicans aborted ratification.

Finally, after prolonged and acrimonious negotiations, President Carter secured the ratification of two integrally related U.S.-Panama treaties, one in April 1978 providing for the transfer of the Canal Zone to Panamanian sovereignty in the year 2000, the second in September 1979, guaranteeing the Canal's permanent neutrality and the right of the U.S. to defend the Canal indefinitely into the future.

Viewed in larger regional and U.S. foreign policy perspectives, the 1989 invasion of Panama was a continuation of U.S. policy toward Central America and the Caribbean, and Mexico, throughout the twentieth century, another dramatic expression of the Monroe Doctrine of U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere (1823). That long-standing policy was evident in the prolonged U.S. occupation of Haiti (1915-34) and inter alia in many international crises: among them, Cases #2--Costa Rican Coup, in 1918-19, in Costa Rica/Nicaragua PC; #19--Costa Rica/Panama Border, in 1921, in Americas: Non-PCs; #33--Nicaragua Civil War I, in 1926-27, in Americas: Non-PCs. Since the end of World War II, U.S. intervention occurred in Cases #144--Guatemala, in 1953-54, and #181--Bay of Pigs, in 1961, in Multiregional PCs: East/West; #215--Dominican Intervention, in 1965, and #343--Invasion of Grenada, in 1983, both in Americas: Non-PCs; #354--Nicaragua MIG-21s, in 1984, in Multiregional PCs: East/West; and #383--Contras III, in 1988, in Honduras/Nicaragua PC.

Pre-crisis Both of Carter's Republican successors in the White House, Reagan (1981-89) and Bush (1989-93), perceived the revised Panama Canal treaties as an affront to U.S. primacy in the Western Hemisphere, an infringement of U.S. national security, and a threat to basic U.S. interests in the Caribbean. Moreover, during the last year of Reagan's presidency and the first two years of the Bush administration, Washington made persistent efforts to remove General Manuel Noriega, successor to Torrijos, from his dominant position in Panama's military and its political system.

The U.S. campaign to oust General Noriega began in February 1988 with the imposition of economic sanctions on Panama. In July Reagan considered covert military action against Noriega, but the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee objected and aborted the plan. Bush continued Reagan's policy; and in April 1989 he called for free elections in Panama. These were held on 7 May; but the results were nullified on the 10th. The next day Bush announced further economic measures against Panama: sanctions had seriously undermined Panama's economy by then.

An attempted coup against Noriega on 3 October 1989 failed. Five days later Secretary of State Baker confirmed U.S. complicity in that covert act. In short, the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989 was the culmination of a prolonged U.S. covert campaign, which coincided with a two-and-a-half-year domestic political crisis within Panama.

Summary:

A crisis for the U.S. was triggered by an official statement in Panama City on 15 December proclaiming Noriega head of government. The next day a U.S. marine was killed by Panamanian soldiers. And Panamanian officials issued a declaration of a state of war with the United States. (Many critics, within the U.S. and abroad, regarded these events as a pretext for a long-planned invasion.)

Washington enunciated four reasons for the invasion: to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama; to defend democracy in Panama; to apprehend Noriega and to bring him to trial on charges of direct involvement in drug trafficking from South America to the United States; and to ensure the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties.

The decision to intervene was made by President Bush on 17 December. Its implementation, through an invasion force of 26,000 troops on the 20th in "Operation Just Cause," triggered a crisis for Panama. On 21 December Panama's church leaders, guardians of the May 1989 election results, proposed that the winning candidate, Endara, be proclaimed President. This occurred after Noriega's surrender on 3 January, following an intense 12-day military campaign against him and his National Guard. This marked the end of the Invasion of Panama crisis.

Both the USSR and the OAS condemned U.S. military action. So too did the UN: on 29 December the General Assembly adopted a resolution deploring the U.S. intervention as a violation of international law.

(Noriega was flown to Florida for a lengthy detention and trial, leading to long-term imprisonment. U.S. economic sanctions against Panama were lifted; and in May 1990 the U.S. Congress approved a $420 million aid package to support the new Endara regime. However, during the next five years Panama's leaders frequently complained about the niggardly transfer of aid funds from the U.S.)
