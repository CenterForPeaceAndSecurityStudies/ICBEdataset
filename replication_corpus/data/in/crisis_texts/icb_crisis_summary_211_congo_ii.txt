CRISNO 211

CONGO II

Background:

The formation of a rebel regime and the taking of hostages in Stanleyville led to a crisis for Congo (later, Zaire), Belgium, the United States, and the USSR lasting from 4 August to 30 December 1964.

Background and Pre-crisis On 29 September 1963 President Kasavubu disbanded Congo's parliament after a series of increasingly repressive measures was passed against the political opposition. The deterioration of economic and social conditions, along with repression, led to societal unrest that manifested itself in tribal fighting, raids, and other arbitrary acts of violence--mainly in East Katanga and Upper Congo. Large-scale uprisings, led by the National Liberation Committee (NLC), occurred during January and April 1964. On 30 June the UN Emergency Force, which had been set up in 1960, left Congo. In July of that year Kasavubu requested Moise Tshombe to form a new government. The governments of Congo-Brazzaville, Burundi, and Mali were accused of giving support to the NLC, as were the USSR and China, which were providing arms and military training. Rebel activities against the central government increased, and large areas in the eastern part of the country, including Stanleyville, were under control of the rebel forces.

Summary:

The trigger to Congo's crisis was the formation of a Revolutionary Council in Stanleyville on 4 August 1964, with the NLC leader Christophe Gbenye as President, after rebel forces had occupied the city. Congo's response, on the 6th, was an appeal by Premier Tshombe to the United States and Belgium for direct military aid. Tshombe also took his case to the OAU, which resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to examine the situation and to act as a mediator between the central Congo government and the rebels.

The trigger for the United States and Belgium occurred on 26 September when Gbenye, who was holding 1,500 white foreign civilians as hostages in Stanleyville, announced that they would not be allowed to leave the city. Their safety was made contingent upon a cease-fire, the eschewing of bombings by the central government, and the termination of Western support. This was accompanied by threats of physical harm against the hostages if those conditions were rejected. The U.S.'s, and Belgium's, major response, on 22 November, was to dispatch paratroops to a British base in Congo to prepare for a military rescue of the hostages. On the 24th an emergency NATO meeting, requested by Belgium, expressed sympathy and support for the Western countries.

The paratroops occupied Stanleyville on 24 November and rescued the hostages within a few hours. The Congo government coordinated an attack on the rebels for the same time as the rescue mission. Control was handed back to the central government on 29 November, marking the termination date for Belgium and the United States.

A crisis for the USSR was triggered by the Belgian/U.S. rescue mission on 24 November. The Soviets feared that Tshombe's pro-Western regime would crush the rebels and thus reduce Soviet influence in the area. The USSR's response, on the 26th, was to accuse the U.S., Belgium, and Britain of aggressive intervention. The Soviet crisis ended on 17 December when its embassy in Kinshasa was closed down.

Discussions were held at the Security Council between 9 and 30 December. It adopted a resolution on 30 December, calling for a cease-fire in the fighting between the rebels and the central government, the removal of mercenaries, and a stop to foreign intervention. This terminated Congo's crisis and the international crisis as a whole.

(In early 1965 President Kasavubu dismissed Premier Tshombe and was himself ousted in a coup d'Ã©tat led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu on 25 November 1965. Relations between Congo-Brazzaville and Congo-Kinshasa remained poor until 1970, when diplomatic relations and river traffic were finally restored.)
