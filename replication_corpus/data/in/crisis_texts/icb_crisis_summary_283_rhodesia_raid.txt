CRISNO 283

RHODESIA RAID

Background:

Rhodesian air raids on ZIPRA bases in Zambia brought about a crisis for that state from 31 August 1977 until 14 August 1978.

Background Despite ongoing discussions in search of an acceptable constitutional settlement to the Rhodesian conflict, the situation deteriorated in 1977. In May of that year the British government released information that claimed that Rhodesia's Prime Minister Smith had proposed to take preemptive action against guerrilla attacks on the grounds that a buildup of African forces was taking place on the Zambian side of Rhodesia's border. Zambia was the home base for ZAPU and its revolutionary army, ZIPRA. On 16 May Zambia's President Kaunda said that a state of war existed with Rhodesia. On 8 July he stated that his country had approached one or two other states, presumably Cuba and Somalia, for aid. Earlier, on 8 June, Rhodesia accused Zambia of a rocket attack and threatened to disconnect Zambia's power from Rhodesia's Kariba hydroelectric station. In August an increasing number of incidents were reported on Rhodesia's borders with Zambia and Botswana. On the 27th it was reported from Zambia that air strikes were feared. In the light of tensions since May and the growing fear in late August, the first incident to take place was likely to trigger a fresh crisis.

Summary:

On 31 August 1977 a crisis was triggered for Zambia when Rhodesian jet bombers strafed the border district of Luanshya causing casualties and damage to property. Kaunda's response, on 3 September, was to impose several days of blackout and curfew in Lusaka, Zambia's capital, and in other cities. On the 7th the blackout and curfew were extended indefinitely when Kaunda invoked full powers under the state of emergency that had existed since Rhodesia's declaration of independence in 1965 (see Case #218--Rhodesia's UDI). On the 11th the president accused Rhodesia of using napalm, which was denied the following day by the Combined Operational Headquarters in Rhodesia. The curfew was lifted on 20 September.

A period of highly conflictual relations between the two states followed. Escalation occurred on 6 March 1978 when Rhodesian forces entered Zambian territory in force with aircraft, helicopters, and ground troops attacking the Luanshya district in what the Smith regime described as "hot pursuit." A secret meeting between Prime Minister Smith and ZAPU leader Nkomo in Lusaka on 14 August 1978 ended Zambia's crisis. The meeting, held under the auspices of President Kaunda, indicated an easing of tension. Smith attempted to bring Nkomo into his domestic support group via changes in the Executive Council of Rhodesia, to include local black representation. The council was set up in March 1978 but had been losing support among Rhodesia's black population.

The UN Security Council met on 15-17 March 1978 and adopted a resolution reaffirming sanctions against Rhodesia, which Zambia had been carrying out fully at great sacrifice. The OAU held discussions without passing a resolution. The United States and Britain attempted to seek implementation of the Anglo-American proposals for a constitutional settlement leading to internationally recognized independence for Rhodesia. There was no USSR involvement in this crisis.

(The Zambian railway to Rhodesia was reopened on 6 October 1978.)
