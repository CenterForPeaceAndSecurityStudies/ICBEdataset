CRISNO 129

PUSHTUNISTAN I

Background:

Afghanistan and Pakistan experienced a two-stage crisis over a long-standing border dispute from mid-March 1949 to 5 October 1950.

Summary:

Afghanistan's demand for an independent Pathan state was followed by a propaganda campaign between the two countries in March 1949. The crisis trigger for Afghanistan occurred in mid-March when the Pakistani government arrested infiltrators into its North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and initiated efforts toward more effective control of that region, while rejecting any Afghanistan claims to the territory. On 27 March it was reported that Afghanistan had moved two divisions and part of its air force to the Pakistani frontier. On 2 April Afghanistan recalled its diplomatic representatives to Pakistan. Tension between the two countries increased following an incident on 12 June when a Pakistani plane bombed the village of Moghulgai, 2,100 yards from the frontier. After an investigation by a joint Afghanistan-Pakistan commission, Pakistan took responsibility for an unintentional flight and offered to pay compensation, ending Afghanistan's crisis on 31 July 1949.

On 12 August a large group of Afridi Pathans met on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line and established a Pushtunistan Assembly. When Pushtunistan's independence was proclaimed, it was immediately recognized by Afghanistan.

The tension level remained low for several months. The beginning of 1950 signaled the start of new propaganda campaigns between the two countries. The pro-Pushtunistan movement in Afghanistan strengthened during the spring and summer. Tribal unrest was prevalent, and demands for the separation of Pathanistan increased.

The trigger for Pakistan occurred on 30 September 1950, more than a year after the termination of Afghanistan's crisis, when Afghan troops invaded Pakistan. Pakistan responded with troops and aircraft and succeeded in driving the Afghan forces across the border on 5 October 1950, which marked the termination date of Pakistan's crisis.

The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved.
