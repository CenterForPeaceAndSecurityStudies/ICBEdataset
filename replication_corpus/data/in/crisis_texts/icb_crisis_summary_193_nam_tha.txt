CRISNO 193

NAM THA

Background:

The duration of this second Pathet Lao crisis for Thailand and the United States was from 6 May to 12 June 1962.

Pre-crisis Following the cease-fire of May 1961, talks in Geneva began on the problem of Laos. Negotiations proceeded slowly, with such issues as the seating of the Pathet Lao delegation as a full representative and frequent violations of the cease-fire threatening the continuation of the talks in general. The Kennedy/Khrushchev meeting in Vienna on 3-4 June 1961 resulted in a joint statement calling for a neutralized Laos and an effective cease-fire. Difficulties among the three Laotian factions--pro-communist, pro-West, nonaligned--prevented the forming of a coalition government. Negotiations reached a deadlock in early 1962. This was followed by an increased Pathet Lao military presence in the Nam Tha area bordering Thailand. In February Pathet Lao forces, with Vietminh support, began a siege of the capital of Nam Tha. On 13 February Thai troops were deployed to strategic areas near the Laotian border. At a news conference the following day President Kennedy expressed concern about the situation. By the end of April there was no progress in the negotiations, and new fighting had broken out.

Summary:

A crisis for Thailand and the United States was triggered on 6 May 1962 when a heavy Pathet Lao attack was launched against Nam Tha. Laos government forces retreated without resistance across the Mekong River into Thai territory, abandoning northwest Laos to the Pathet Lao and thereby opening the way for them to move to the northern border of Thailand. On 11 May Thailand's Prime Minister Sarit ordered several units of the Thai armed forces to reinforce defenses along the border with Laos. The United States' response, on 12 May, was an order by President Kennedy to send the Seventh Fleet to the Gulf of Siam and to put U.S. armed forces elsewhere in the Pacific and at home on standby alert. At the request of the Thai government 1,000 U.S. marines, in Thailand for SEATO exercises, were moved to the Laotian border on 14 May. On the 15th Kennedy announced that 4,000 more U.S. troops had been ordered into Thailand to protect its territorial integrity. The U.S. deployment put a stop to the Pathet Lao drive, and political pressure was successful in reopening negotiations.

The crisis ended on 12 June 1962 for both actors when the three Laotian princes (Souvanna Phouma, Boum Oum, and Souphanouvong) signed an agreement on their participation in a "Government of National Union," indicating a tacit understanding between Thailand and the U.S., on the one hand, and North Vietnam, on the other.

An emergency meeting of the SEATO Council requested that members send token military forces to Thailand on 16 May: all agreed, with the exception of France. The USSR's involvement was political: Ambassador Dobrynin and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk met on 15 May and agreed on the need to maintain the cease-fire and establish a neutral and independent Laos. The USSR condemned the movement of U.S. troops to Thailand as aggression. There was no UN involvement.
