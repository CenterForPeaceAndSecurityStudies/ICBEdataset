CRISNO 355

BOTSWANA RAID

Background:

Botswana experienced a crisis with the Union of South Africa from 14 to 21 June 1985.

Background and Pre-crisis From 1978 until 1988 South Africa used its superior military power to launch frequent raids against neighboring states--some at the level of full-scale invasion--alleging that Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were providing sanctuaries for African National Congress (ANC) fighters. Most of these incursions were directed at Angola (see Background to Case #323; and Case #380 in Angola PC).

On 16 March 1984 the Nkomati Accord between Mozambique and South Africa neutralized the former as a sanctuary for the ANC. Pretoria, concerned that the ANC would move its bases from Mozambique to Botswana, pressed Botswana to sign a similar agreement; but it refused. Botswana accused South Africa of applying economic, as well as military and political, pressure. In September 1984 South Africa reiterated that it would take whatever action was necessary to ensure its security.

Summary:

On 14 June 1985 the SADF launched a raid on 10 alleged centers of ANC guerrillas in the capital of Botswana, Gaborne. Botswana denied the charge. In protest, the U.S. recalled its ambassador from Pretoria. The U.K. protested to South Africa's ambassador in London. India and other members of the Non-Aligned Movement denounced the raid. So too did the OAU and the UN Secretary-General.

Most visible in this chorus of criticism was the UN Security Council. In its Resolution 568 passed on 21 June, the Council unanimously condemned South Africa's act and demanded that it pay "full and adequate compensation." This ended the crisis for Botswana--but not South Africa's ubiquitous raids.

The USSR was not involved.

(The next day, Pretoria threatened to invade Botswana if it did not change its policy toward the ANC. And on 19 May 1986 it launched another raid against Botswana, as well as Zambia and Zimbabwe [see Case #365].)
