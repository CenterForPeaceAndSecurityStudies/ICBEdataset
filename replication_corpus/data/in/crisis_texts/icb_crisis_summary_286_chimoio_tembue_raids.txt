CRISNO 286

CHIMOIO-TEMBUE RAIDS

Background:

Rhodesian attacks on bases of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) in Mozambique triggered another crisis for Mozambique from 23 November 1977 to 22 March 1978.

Pre-crisis After the Mapai Seizure of May-June 1977 (see Case #278), there was a decline in military activity on the Mozambique border. However, in November 1977 the raids of Rhodesian forces into Mozambique were reported to be the heaviest since the guerrilla war had begun. Serious food shortages prevailed in Mozambique prior to the crisis.

Summary:

On 23-24 November 1977 Rhodesian forces attacked the main operational headquarters of ZANLA near Chimoio in Mozambique. This was followed by raids on a base at Tembue, on 25-26 November. These attacks triggered a crisis for Mozambique. Salisbury announced that 1,200 ZANLA "terrorists" had been killed, expressing regret at the possibility of civilian deaths, but emphasizing that Rhodesia was at war and that civilians, particularly women and children, should not be in such camps. On 1 December Prime Minister Smith added that the raids had been essential to stop heavy attacks that had been planned against Rhodesia. ZANLA leader Mugabe denied that the Chimoio camp was a guerrilla base. On 23 December 1977 and on 14-15 February 1978, Rhodesia made public documents it claimed to have seized during the raids listing women guerrillas with their weapons, adding there had been armed clashes between rival ZANLA and ZIPRA (Zimbabwe Peoples Revolutionary Army) units.

President Machel visited Nigeria and Angola for talks between 13 and 17 December; and on the 18th, upon his return to Mozambique, he met with leaders of the "Front-Line States" to discuss joint strategy. At that meeting the presidents of Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia drew up a four-point declaration expressing their support for some aspects of the Anglo-American plan to develop a clear timetable for achieving majority rule in Rhodesia, while reaffirming the unity of their group and its commitment to the Patriotic Front in its "liberation war." Termination of Mozambique's crisis occurred on 22 March when it approved a law for compulsory military service.

The OAU Ministerial Committee met in January 1978 to discuss this crisis. The Rhodesian raids were condemned by the U.K. and the U.S. And the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for assistance to Mozambique. Several months before these Rhodesian raids, arms to aid the guerrillas had been received in Mozambique from both China and the Soviet Union, though neither was directly involved in the crisis.
