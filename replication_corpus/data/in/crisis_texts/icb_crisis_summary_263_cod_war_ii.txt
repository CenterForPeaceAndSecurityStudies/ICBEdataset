CRISNO 263

COD WAR II

Background:

Disputes over fishing rights in waters contiguous to Iceland precipitated another crisis for the U.K. and Iceland from 23 November 1975 to 1 June 1976.

Pre-crisis In November 1973 an agreement was reached between Iceland and the U.K. that set the former's territorial waters as 50 miles offshore, within which certain areas were set aside for British fishers (see Case #254). On 15 July 1975 the government of Iceland announced its intention to extend its territorial waters to 200 miles off the Icelandic coast, as of 15 October; further, all foreign vessels would be forbidden to fish inside the new limit. During November Icelandic gunboats harassed British trawlers fishing for cod within the 200-mile limit.

Summary:

On 23 November 1975 British trawler skippers warned the U.K. that they would withdraw from Iceland's 200-mile zone unless they were assured of Royal Navy protection. On the 25th the British government, convinced of the danger to the welfare and safety of the fishers, decided to dispatch frigates to Icelandic waters, triggering a crisis for Iceland. Iceland's foreign minister termed this U.K. move as "unmasked armed violence" and initiated talks between the two governments. The foreign ministers met in December 1975 and the prime ministers in January 1976. When these talks did not achieve progress, Iceland broke diplomatic relations with the U.K. on 18 February. Britain maintained the presence of the Royal Navy in Icelandic waters throughout the crisis, in order to protect the trawlers engaged in uninterrupted fishing. There were minor clashes. On 1 June 1976 an interim agreement between the two countries was signed in Oslo, allowing British trawlers fishing rights within the 200-mile zone, while limiting their number to an average of 24 trawlers a day.

The UN Security Council mediated the crisis from 2 to 11 December 1975; and talks between the two disputants were held under UN auspices. In addition, the UN was the first to suggest that economic issues of the crisis should be discussed. NATO and the Nordic Council discussed the military and economic issues of the crisis and met with the Icelandic and British leaders.

(A similar, though non-violent, incident over fishing rights between Canada and Spain, backed by the European Union, erupted in March 1995, with Canada's seizure of a Spanish trawler in the North Atlantic for alleged "illegal fishing.")
