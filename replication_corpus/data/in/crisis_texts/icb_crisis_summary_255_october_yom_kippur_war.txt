CRISNO 255

OCTOBER-YOM KIPPUR WAR

Background:

The October-Yom Kippur crisis began on 5 October 1973 and ended on 31 May 1974. The crisis actors were Israel, Syria, the United States, Egypt, and the Soviet Union.

Background and Pre-crisis The West Bank of the Jordan River, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, and the entire Sinai Peninsula had been occupied by Israel since the Six Day War of June 1967 (see Case #222). In March 1969 Egypt launched a War of Attrition against Israeli forces in the Sinai. In August 1970 a cease-fire was accepted by both sides with plans to put into effect a U.S. plan for peace in the region (see Case #232). The plan was never implemented. In April 1973 Israeli forces were put on alert, including a large mobilization, when its leaders suspected Egyptian mobilization and war exercises to be a prelude to an invasion of Israel (see Case #253). The invasion never took place.

On 13 September 1973 Israel and Syria fought an air battle in which 13 Syrian MIGs and one Israeli Mirage were shot down. When Syria did not react immediately to this dramatic defeat, Israel became suspicious that Damascus was planning a more basic action. Israeli forces in the north were strengthened, and precautionary measures were also taken in the south. Syria's massing of three infantry divisions, tanks, and artillery, and a mobilization of Syrian reserves in the north, along with the evacuation of Soviet military advisors and their families from Damascus and Cairo, were all noted by Israeli intelligence. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was put on the highest state of alert. Nevertheless, Israeli intelligence, as late as 3 October 1973, perceived the outbreak of war to be very unlikely. This erroneous judgment was based upon two Israeli misperceptions: that Egypt's inferior air power would not permit it to launch a war against Israel, and that Syria would not "go it alone," without Egyptian active participation.

Summary:

On 5 October 1973 a movement of Egyptian forces toward the Suez Canal and a change from a defensive to an offensive posture triggered a crisis for Israel. At the same time, Israel's intelligence service belatedly reported an impending Egyptian attack across the Canal scheduled for the following day. Israel immediately raised the IDF alert level and strengthened its forces along the northern and southern borders. The war began on 6 October with a simultaneous attack by Egyptian and Syrian forces. Egypt's successful crossing of the Suez Canal on the 7th and Syria's advance on the Golan Heights catalyzed an Israeli intra-war crisis (IWC): perceiving a grave danger, it adopted the "Samson Option," the use of Israeli nuclear weapons to stem the Egyptian/Syrian resort to counterattacks on the coastal plain. A few days later, on 14 October 1973, Israel's nuclear weapons were returned to storage. By 10 October, after heavy losses, Israeli forces succeeded in reversing the tide of battle in the north, triggering a crisis for Syria. Syria's response was multiple: it stepped up resistance, called upon Egypt to increase military pressure on Israel in the south, and appealed to the Soviet Union for aid. During the next three days Israeli forces advanced 10 kilometers beyond the 1967 cease-fire lines into Syrian territory.

On 12 October Israeli Prime Minister Meir agreed to a cease-fire in place. Its rejection by Egypt and Syria triggered a crisis for the United States, which feared a possible confrontation with the USSR. All seven Soviet airborne divisions had been placed on an increased state of readiness. The heavy Soviet commitment to the Arabs, in the form of resupplying arms by air and sea, indicated to Washington that Moscow would not tolerate a humiliating Arab defeat comparable to that in 1967.

The successful Egyptian operation to cross the Suez Canal was followed on 14 October by a large-scale tank battle in which Egypt suffered a severe defeat. On the 16th the Israelis crossed the Canal, threatening to surround the Egyptian Third Army. A crisis for Egypt was triggered on the 18th when Sadat became aware of the worsening position. Egypt's response was to pressure the Soviet Union to obtain a cease-fire agreement, which was accepted by Israel and Egypt on 22 October. When the Egyptians continued their attempt to destroy Israeli tank concentrations in order to open up an escape route for the Third Army, fighting broke out once more, with Israel strengthening its positions on the Egyptian side of the Canal.

Israeli violations of the 22 October cease-fire agreement triggered a crisis for the Soviet Union. Moscow responded on the 24th with a movement of naval vessels and a Note from President Brezhnev to President Nixon containing a clear warning that, unless the Israeli onslaught on the west bank of the Suez Canal was stopped at once, the USSR might intervene unilaterally. The U.S. responded with mounting pressure on Israel to stop fighting and to allow nonmilitary supplies to reach the Third Army. At the same time, Nixon issued a sharp reply to Moscow: most of the U.S. armed forces, including the Strategic Air Command with its nuclear capability, were put on a high state of alert, namely "Defensive Condition 3."

The crisis escalated further when, on 25 October, a Soviet freighter arrived in Alexandria reportedly carrying nuclear weapons. Finally, on 26 October 1973, a U.S.-Soviet-sponsored Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire was accepted by all the parties.

Talks between Egypt and Israel, with the active participation of U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger, continued for two months and concentrated on withdrawal to the post-Six Day War lines, the problem of the encircled Third Army, and the exchange of prisoners. A one-day symbolic Geneva Conference was convened on 21 December. Israel agreed to withdraw to 20 kilometers from the Canal and the size of both forces was reduced. A Disengagement Agreement was signed on 18 January 1974, ending the crisis for Egypt.

The negotiations between Israel and Syria took much longer. Kissinger mediated once more. Israel's demand for a complete list of all Israeli prisoners of war was negotiated by Kissinger in February 1974. In March Syria announced that it had decided to resume the war immediately. Shelling of Israeli-held positions in the north and firing back and forth continued throughout the spring of 1974. On 2 May the U.S. secretary of state began a month of shuttle diplomacy, traveling between Damascus and Jerusalem, with side trips to Riyad, Amman, and Cairo.

In the final agreement Israel returned parts of the Syrian town of Quneitra but kept control over two of the three strategic hills in the area where heavy weapons were forbidden. A UN buffer zone was established. The Israeli demand that Syria commit itself to a cessation of all terrorist activities was refused. As in the case of the Israel-Egypt Agreement, a U.S. Memorandum of Understanding was given to Israel. The Agreement was announced on 29 May and was signed on 31 May 1974, terminating the crisis for Israel, Syria, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

The superpowers, as crisis actors, were involved at a high level. Each supplied massive arms and equipment, as well as political support, to its client state. The cease-fire agreements were worked out between their representatives. Premier Kosygin arrived in Cairo on 16 October to persuade Egypt to accept a cease-fire. Kissinger visited Moscow on 19-20 October and hammered out a draft resolution for the Security Council, calling for an immediate cease-fire. The Council adopted this resolution within hours and authorized the creation of a UN force to police the Golan Heights.
