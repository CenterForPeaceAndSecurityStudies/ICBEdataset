CRISNO 87

OCCUPATION OF IRAN

Background:

Iran's crisis over the Anglo-Soviet invasion of its territory began on 25 August 1941 and ended on 29 January 1942.

Background Iran's neutrality at the onset of World War II was opposed by the U.K. and the Soviet Union because of that country's rich oil reserves and their need for strategic bases and communication routes. They particularly objected to the large number of Germans in Iran and demanded their expulsion by August 1941. Iran refused to comply, maintaining its right to control its own internal affairs.

Summary:

The Anglo-Soviet invasion on 25 August 1941 triggered a crisis for Iran, which promptly ordered its army to resist the attack. When resistance collapsed within 48 hours, Reza Shah abdicated in favor of his son Muhammad Reza. A decision was reached on 28 August at an extraordinary session of Iran's cabinet to cease fire and to continue diplomatic negotiations already in progress. Soviet troops occupied the north of the country, while the British occupied the south, joined, in 1942, by U.S. troops. Negotiations with Britain and the Soviet Union continued throughout the year. While the British assumed a more flexible position, the Soviets proceeded to increase their demands upon Iran. During the course of the negotiations Iran sought direct U.S. intervention. While the U.S. refused to participate in the talks at that time, it was instrumental in bringing about a tripartite Treaty of Alliance signed on 29 January 1942. Under its terms, the U.K., the U.S., and the USSR undertook to respect Iran's sovereignty and to withdraw from that country within six months after the cessation of hostilities with the Axis powers. This ended Iran's crisis.

The League of Nations had ceased to exist de facto at the time of this crisis.
