CRISNO 44

SAUDI-YEMEN WAR

Background:

A crisis between Sa'udi Arabia and Yemen over territory began on 18 December 1933 and ended on 20 May 1934.

Background In 1930 the former protectorate of 'Asir was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hijaz and Najd (later, Sa'udi Arabia), thus extending its territory to the Yemen border. The imam of Yemen then claimed a number of frontier districts between the two states. Tribes residing in 'Asir, aided by Yemen, staged a revolt against King Ibn Sa'ud. Treaties of friendship had been signed between Sa'udi Arabia and Great Britain, and between Yemen and Italy.

Summary:

On 18 December 1933 the Sa'udis received information that Yemeni troops had entered Asir. That day Sa'udi Arabia decided to initiate talks with Yemen. A conference was convened on 16 March 1934, but Yemen refused to withdraw from the disputed area. The Sa'udis opted for military action and, on 22 March 1934, ordered troops into 'Asir. This triggered a crisis for Yemen. Sa'udi troops advanced into the disputed highland and along Yemen's coastal plain, to the port of Hudeida. British, French, and Italian warships were sent to the area, and their combined political and military pressure succeeded in halting the first Saudi advance.

Yemen resisted the Sa'udi assault at first, but, on 12 April, the imam cabled Ibn Sa'ud requesting peace and announcing that his troops had been ordered to evacuate 'Asir. Fighting continued during the talks on the terms of the armistice, assisted by a conciliation commission of Egyptians and Syrians. On 13 May 1934 Sa'udi Arabia officially announced an armistice: the imam had agreed to carry out the Sa'udi conditions. A peace conference began on 18 May, and on 20 May the crisis ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ta'if, which recognized Sa'udi Arabia's sovereignty over all of 'Asir, including the oasis of Najran, the initial source of the dispute, and called for financial reparations from Yemen, in return for the withdrawal of Sa'udi forces from Yemeni territory.

The League of Nations was not involved in this crisis.

(This long-standing border dispute over the districts of 'Asir, Jizan, and Najran generated another crisis between Sa'udi Arabia and Yemen in January-February 1995: Yemen reopened a claim to these territories which it acknowledged in a border agreement in 1973 had rightly been annexed by Sa'udi Arabia. However, unlike in 1933-34 the clashes occurred at many points along the Sa'udi Arabia/Yemen border. On 26 February 1995 they announced that a joint committee would demarcate the largely undefined 2,000-kilometer boundary.)
