CRISNO 425

INDIA-PAKISTAN NUCLEAR TESTS

Background:

India conducted nuclear tests on 11 May 1998, triggering a crisis for India and Pakistan. This was followed by Pakistan's own tests later in the month. The crisis terminated on 11 June 1998, when Pakistan announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests.

Background and Pre-Crisis

Following national elections in March 1998, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) formed a coalition government in India. It was widely believed that the coalition government would follow a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly towards neighboring Pakistan. Shortly after the elections, the government announced that it would exercise the option to develop nuclear weapons, a shift from the country's previously ambiguous stand on the issue. In April 1998, Pakistan tested its medium-range surface-to-surface Ghauri missile, capable of reaching Indian territory. This heightened tensions between the two countries. In the same period, there were reports of heavy artillery fire exchange between the two countries. In May, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes declared that China posed the greatest potential security threat to India and accused China of providing nuclear technology to Pakistan. China, however, dismissed Mr. Fernandes's comments as "ridiculous."

Summary:

The trigger to the crisis was a series of nuclear tests conducted by India on 11 May 1998 and 13 May 1998, which put both India and Pakistan in a state of crisis. Tensions rose further on 18 May when Indian Home Minster Lal Krishna Advani announced that India would follow a "pro-active" policy towards alleged Pakistani interference in Kashmir. On 21 May, however, India softened its line by announcing a self-declared moratorium on further nuclear tests, and offered to negotiate a "no first-use" nuclear pact with Pakistan.

Uncertainty surrounding how Pakistan would respond ended on 28 May 1998, when it announced that it had detonated five nuclear devices that day. The tests were preceded by intense pressure from the US government, including a telephone conversation between Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and US President Bill Clinton, when the latter urged Mr. Sharif not to proceed with the tests. In the aftermath of tests, the US imposed sanctions on Pakistan, similar to the ones already imposed on India. In both countries, the tests enjoyed widespread domestic support. The crisis ended on 11 June, when the Pakistani government announced a moratorium on nuclear tests and said that it was ready to formalize the arrangement with India and other countries.

The tests provoked international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions by several countries, including the US, Japan, Germany and Canada. The United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, expressed deep regret over the tests and called for maximum restraint from countries in the region. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency session over the issue and called on both countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The European Union and the G-8 expressed concern over the situation. There was no mediation in the case.
