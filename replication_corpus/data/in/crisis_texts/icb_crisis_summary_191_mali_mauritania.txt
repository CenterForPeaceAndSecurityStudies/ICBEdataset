CRISNO 191

MALI-MAURITANIA

Background:

A crisis for Mauritania lasted from 29 March 1962 to 18 February 1963.

Background and Pre-crisis The border between Mauritania and Mali had been the subject of dispute since 1944. Nomadic tribes from both states crossed back and forth over the border. Prior to the independence of both countries, in 1960, conferences on future boundaries were held, but immediately after independence relations between the two states deteriorated. Guerrillas, thought to be organized by Morocco and based in Mali, carried out actions in Mauritania: there were several attempted assassinations of Mauritanian officials as well. In early 1962 Mauritania changed its position on the border question, successfully overcoming internal Moroccan-supported opposition.

Summary:

On 29 March 1962 six people were accused of murdering French officers at Nama in eastern Mauritania, triggering a crisis for that state. Mali was accused of harboring a Moroccan terrorist group that aimed at ridding Mauritania of the French in order to facilitate Moroccan territorial claims in the area. The response, on 6 April, was a presidential declaration that Mauritania would not allow any attempt against the integrity of the country. On 7 June 1962 the Mauritanian UN representative charged that Moroccan terrorists, trained in bases in Mali, had raided border outposts in his country.

A political settlement was reached by the presidents of the two countries at Kayes, Mali, on 18 February 1963 ending the crisis. The nationals of both states were guaranteed nomadic rights and the use of wells in disputed areas. Compromise agreements were reached, although Mali gained more territory than Mauritania.

Neither the U.S. nor the USSR, nor the UN, was involved in this crisis.
