CRISNO 130

LUPERON

Background:

This minicrisis involved one actor only, the Dominican Republic. It started on 19 June 1949 and terminated two days later.

Background Tension in the Caribbean region was high, and there had been several attempts by the Caribbean League to overthrow Trujillo, the Dominican Republic's authoritarian ruler (see Case #117--Cuba/Dominican Republic).

Summary:

On 19 June 1949 a planeload of 15 mercenaries from Guatemala landed at Luperon in the Dominican Republic. The plane was destroyed by the Dominican navy, and the expedition was crushed immediately. Although this did not represent a large-scale military threat, Trujillo took the incident seriously and on 21 June sent a protest note to Cuba, along with threatening words to Guatemala--the Dominican Republic's major response to a perceived threat to its political regime. That day the Cuban government announced its determination to stop the enlistment of men to fight as mercenaries, and the crisis terminated, although tension in the area remained high until December 1951, the culmination of all OAS activity to settle the disputes in the region.

The U.S., the USSR, and the UN were not involved in this crisis.
