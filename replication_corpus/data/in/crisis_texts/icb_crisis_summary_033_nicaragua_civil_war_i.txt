NICARAGUA CIVIL WAR I

Background:

Nicaragua experienced a crisis with Mexico from 17 August 1926 until 15 May 1927.

Background Several months after a (periodic) withdrawal of U.S. marines, in August 1925, Nicaragua was again embroiled in civil war: it erupted because opponents of President Emiliano Chamorro interpreted U.S. nonrecognition of his regime as carte blanche to overthrow him. Moreover, Mexico's President Plutarco Calles seized upon the opportunity of internal disarray to reassert Mexico's influence in Central America by aiding the Liberal opposition to Chamorro.

Summary:

The trigger to Nicaragua's foreign policy crisis was the Chamorro government's awareness on 17 August 1926 that a Mexican auxiliary warship had set sail with men and arms to aid Nicaraguan rebels. Nicaragua responded on the 24th by notifying the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. Mexico denied the allegation on 30 August; but it refused to comply with the request of U.S. President Coolidge on 15 September to impose an embargo on arms and ammunition destined for Nicaragua.

Chamorro resigned on 30 October because of continued U.S. nonrecognition. His successor, Adolfo Diaz, elected by the Nicaragua Congress on 11 November as an interim leader pending a national election, was recognized by Washington on 17 November. However, Juan Sacasa, the Liberal Vice President under Chamorro who had fled Nicaragua, returned on 2 December, was proclaimed President by Liberal supporters, and was recognized by Mexico on 7 December.

U.S. marines returned to Nicaragua in December 1926, ostensibly to protect U.S. and other foreign citizens and property. They also assisted the Diaz regime in the civil war. Nonetheless, the Liberal forces behind Sacasa continued to advance, leading Washington on 5 January 1927 to lift the embargo on arms sales to Nicaragua. This was followed by an arms agreement with Diaz on 25 February 1927.

U.S. policy throughout Nicaragua's civil war was to undermine Mexico's competing influence in Central America. Its decisive intervention in the crisis was the dispatch of presidential envoy Henry L. Stimson to Nicaragua on 31 March with instructions to mediate and end the civil war. Using shuttle diplomacy, Stimson was able to get both factions to agree on all points except the continuation of Diaz as President. On 4 May Stimson achieved an agreement: Diaz was to complete his term of office; the Liberal rebels, led by Jos√© Maria Moncada, were to disarm; and the U.S. would supervise the 1928 presidential election. The next day an amnesty was declared. And on 15 May Stimson wrote to Secretary of State Kellogg that the civil war was over. For Nicaragua the assurance of a continuing U.S. military presence eliminated fears of further Mexican exploitation of civil strife thereby ending its foreign policy crisis.

There were many involved actors in Nicaragua's civil war of 1926-27. Offers to mediate by Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador were declined. The U.S., as noted, was highly involved, militarily and politically, serving as the crucial agent of crisis management. The U.K. sent a warship in February 1927 to evacuate British citizens. And the League of Nations' Secretary-General dispatched a fact-finding mission in response to Nicaragua's Note of 24 August 1926 regarding Mexico's intervention; but there was no further League activity. The Pan American Union was not involved in this crisis.
