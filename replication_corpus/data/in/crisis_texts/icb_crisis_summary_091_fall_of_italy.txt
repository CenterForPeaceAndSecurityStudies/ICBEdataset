CRISNO 91

FALL OF ITALY

Background:

The Allied invasion of Italy triggered an intrawar crisis for Italy and Germany from 9 July to 11 September 1943.

Pre-crisis The Anglo-American campaign in North Africa resulted in a crushing defeat for Germany and Italy in May 1943 (see Case #90).

Summary:

United States, British, and Canadian forces launched an attack on Sicily on 9 July 1943, triggering a crisis for Italy: its mainland was threatened; and there was an imminent danger of the collapse of Mussolini's Fascist regime. Italy's leader perceived capitulation as a threat to Italy's role and status as a great power and felt that it would lead to prolonged occupation by the Allies.

Mussolini met with Hitler on 19 July in the hope of obtaining Hitler's consent to Italy's early withdrawal from the war; no concessions were granted. The Italian response, on 24 July, was the dismissal of Mussolini by the king, at a meeting of the Fascist Grand Council, and the appointment of a new government under Marshal Pietro Badoglio. The council, which had not met since 12 September 1939, criticized Mussolini for leading the country into disaster. The majority of the party leaders were convinced of the advisability of a conclusion of a separate peace and a return to constitutional monarchy.

The news of Mussolini's dismissal, on 25 July, triggered a crisis for Germany. Armistice proposals by Italy, expected within a week to 10 days, would jeopardize German strategic control of northern Italy and expose the Reich's southern flank. The following day Hitler ordered German forces into northern Italy. On 18 August Italian resistance in Sicily collapsed following thousands of casualties on both sides. Allied troops landed on the boot of southern Italy on 2 September. The next day an armistice agreement was signed between Italy and the Western powers, ending hostilities between the Anglo-American forces and those of the Badoglio regime. German and Italian forces evacuated Sicily on 8 September, terminating Italy's crisis with the Allies. On the l0th Italian forces surrendered to the Germans after they were defeated in the battle around Rome. The crisis ended for Germany on 11 September when all Italian territory, including Rome, was declared by the German army to be a theater of war under German military control.

(Mussolini, who had been held prisoner near Rome, was rescued by German troops, and proclaimed the establishment of a Republican Fascist Party in northern Italy, in alliance with the German army of occupation.)
