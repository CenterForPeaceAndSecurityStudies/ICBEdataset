CRISNO 324

IRAQ NUCLEAR REACTOR

Background:

Israel and Iraq experienced a crisis from January until 19 June 1981 over the development and, later, the destruction of the Osirak nuclear reactor.

Background Iraq had long been Israel's most implacable enemy. It was the only Arab participant in the 1948-49 war that did not sign an armistice agreement with Israel (see Case #120). Moreover, for decades it was in the vanguard of the Arab coalition against Israel, in word and deed.

Since the overthrow of its Hashemite monarchy in 1958 (see Case #165--Lebanon-Iraq Upheaval, in Middle East: Non-PCs), and especially after the Ba'ath Party came to power in 1963, Iraq sought to forge a nuclear capability. A pro-Soviet policy led to the construction of a small nuclear research reactor in 1968. In 1975 President Saddam Hussein secured a French commitment to build a larger reactor for "research." Israel's diplomatic efforts from 1976 to 1979 to persuade France to desist from this commitment proved to be in vain. A bomb exploded at Marseilles's harbor on 6 April 1979, with serious damage to a reactor that France had built and that was being dispatched to Iraq.

Pre-crisis On 28 October 1980 Israel's cabinet made a decision in principle to attack the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad. No date was specified; but a tentative date was set--soon after Israel's anticipated elections in November 1981. The rationale was expressed on several occasions by Prime Minister Begin: a nuclear weapon in the hands of any Arab state posed a threat to Israel's existence. A nuclear Iraq under Saddam Hussein was perceived as especially dangerous.

Summary:

A crisis for Israel was triggered by a French announcement in January 1981 that the Osirak reactor would be fully operational by 14 July. Israel Air Force (IAF) plans for a preemptive strike were approved by the cabinet on 15 March, to be implemented before the November election lest Begin be replaced by a Shimon Peres-led Labor government which, it was assumed, would be unwilling to implement this decision. On 3 May the Begin cabinet decided to act by the 10th.

The IAF attack occurred on 7 June, destroying the Osirak nuclear reactor and, for some years, Iraq's embryonic nuclear capability. The IAF raid ended Israel's crisis. Simultaneously, it catalyzed a brief crisis for Iraq--until 19 June, laying bare its vulnerability to Israeli retaliation and Iraq's relative military weakness.

(The initial world reaction was widespread condemnation of Israel--by the U.S., the USSR, France, the UN, and others the next day. Several days later the U.S. expressed its displeasure by suspending the delivery of F-16 planes to Israel, while approving a large-scale arms transfer, including Advanced Warning Airborne Command System (AWACS) aircraft, to Sa'udi Arabia. On 17 July the U.S. suspension was lifted. However, it was only in the context of the Gulf crisis and war a decade later that the major Western powers changed their public stance on Israel's 1981 destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor.).
