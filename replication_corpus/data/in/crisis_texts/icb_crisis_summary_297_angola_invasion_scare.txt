CRISNO 297

ANGOLA INVASION SCARE

Background:

A South African troop buildup precipitated a crisis for Angola from 7 to 14 November 1978.

Pre-crisis In May 1978 South Africa invaded Angola after a guerrilla attack on the Ruacana hydroelectric power station in Namibia (see Case #291--Cassinga Incident). On 22 October Angolan, SWAPO, Cuban, and East German forces launched a major offensive against UNITA in the southern and central parts of Angola

Summary:

On 7 November 1978 Angola's minister of defense stated that intelligence reports had reached him of a major buildup of South African forces along the border with Namibia; further, that South Africa planned a large incursion into Angola. The same day Angola responded with a general mobilization of the Angolan army (about 200,000 men) and a curfew in the five largest urban centers. On 8 November the SADF command issued a statement denying any intention of invading Angola. But on the l0th a bomb explosion in Angola's second largest city, Muambo, gave rise to the fear of an imminent South African attack. The next day Angola's President Neto accused South Africa of fighting an undeclared war against Angola and closed its airspace to South African overflights.

South African statements claimed that Angola's perception of war was the result of UNITA successes in the 22 October campaign and that Angola wished to detract attention from its domestic problems. The crisis ended with a statement on 14 November by South Africa's Prime Minister Botha, denying any intention to invade Angola.

UN activity took the form of an appeal by the UN Special Committee on Apartheid to all governments on 14 November to help Angola repel South African "aggression." Angola accused the Security Council of ineffective measures to stop the threat of invasion.

There was no U.S. or USSR involvement in this crisis.
