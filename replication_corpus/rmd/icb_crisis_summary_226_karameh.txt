CRISNO 226

KARAMEH

Background:

This crisis between Israel and Jordan lasted from 18 to 22 March 1968.

Pre-crisis From 15 February to mid-March 1968 Israel reported 37 sabotage raids from Jordan causing death and injuries among Israeli soldiers and civilians.

Summary:

A crisis for Israel was triggered on 18 March when an Israeli school bus went over a mine near the Jordan border; two children were killed and 28 wounded. Defense Minister Dayan issued a warning to Jordan to prevent further border crossings by Palestinian feda'iyyun. The bus incident and Dayan's warning also triggered a crisis for Jordan: King Hussein stated that on that day he perceived a threat of full-scale invasion from Israel. Israel's response was a raid on the village of Karameh, a feda'iyyun base in Jordan, on 21 March. There was also an appeal to the United Nations. The Jordanian response was to dispatch armed forces to the site. Heavy fighting followed, with severe losses on both sides. Israel's crisis ended when its forces withdrew on 21 March. Jordan's crisis ended the following day, when it reopened the Allenby bridge linking the Israel-occupied West Bank and Jordan.

UN activity took the form of a discussion in the Security Council; no resolution was passed. Both the U.S. and the USSR were politically active in this crisis, with little effect.
