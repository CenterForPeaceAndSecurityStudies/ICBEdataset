CRISNO 366

REBEL ATTACK ON UGANDA

Background:

Uganda experienced a crisis with Sudan from 19 August 1986 to early June 1987.

Background and Pre-crisis Sudan has been beset with internal turmoil since its independence in 1956. During the early years (September 1963-March 1972) civil strife took the form of the "Anya-Nya" war against non-Muslim rebels in the south, who relied upon bases in neighboring states, notably Uganda. There were frequent cross-border raids by Sudanese forces, meetings between leaders of Sudan and Uganda, some agreements to cooperate against the rebels, persistent high tension. The costly Anya-Nya war between Sudan and the Southern Sudanese Liberation Movement--there were several hundred thousand, mostly civilian, casualties--ended on 12 March 1972, with Ethiopian mediation. However, domestic strife and low-intensity conflict between Sudan and Uganda--and within both states--persisted through the 1970s and into the 1980s.

A brief respite in a parallel internal war in Uganda began on 17 December 1985, when Yoweri Museveni, leader of the National Resistance Army (NRA), and General Tito Okello, head of Uganda's Military Council, signed a "peace agreement" in Nairobi ending the former's attempts to overthrow Uganda's regime. Kenya and Tanzania, the mediators, undertook to create a peacekeeping force to monitor the cease-fire. It was short-lived. The NRA resumed its military campaign on 17 January 1986 and took control of Kampala on the 26th. Museveni became President three days later. However, civil strife between the NRA, now in power, and rebel troops of the former Military Council, led by General Okello, continued during the next six months.

Summary:

Uganda's internal conflict acquired an interstate dimension on 19 August, when some 400 rebel troops crossed the border from Sudan and attacked the strategically important town of Gulu in Uganda. Museveni accused Sudan of supporting the rebels. Khartoum denied any involvement but acknowledged that it was difficult to control the border with Uganda because of widespread instability in southern Sudan, alluding to the long-standing civil war against the renamed Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Uganda, in turn, denied that it was supporting the SPLA. In September the Kampala regime unilaterally closed the border with Sudan temporarily.

Civil strife in Uganda continued until an amnesty for all rebel forces went into effect on 11 June 1987. Several days earlier, President Museveni and Sudan's Prime Minister, Sadiq el-Mahdi, met in Khartoum. They agreed on measures to enhance border security, trade relations, and extradition, thereby ending their crisis.

There was no involvement by either of the superpowers, the UN or the OAU.
